2,ENT,episode 0,ARCHER,"Be sure they match the colour to the nacelle housings. Maybe. God, she's beautiful. Neptune and back in six minutes. Let's take a look at thelateral sensor array. Slow down. There, those are the ports that buckled during thelast test. They need to be reinforced. Great, you scratched the paint. Go ahead. Admiral. Not everyone. Where'd he come from? Kronos? Well, isn't that a surprise. You'd think they'd have come upwith something a little more imaginative this time. Corpse? Is he dead? Excuse me, is that man dead? Is he going to die? Let me get this straight. You're going todisconnect this man from life support even though he could live. Nowwhere's the logic in that? So that's your diplomatic solution, to do what they tell you. Pull the plug? We may be crude, but we're not murderers. You're not going tolet them do this, are you? Admiral. We've been deferring to their judgement for a hundred years! How much longer? Ready to what? Volatile? You have no idea how much I'm restraining myself fromknocking you on your ass. These Klingons, they're anxious to get theirman back. Fine. I can have my ship ready to go in three days. We'lltake him back home, alive. Three days, that's all I need. When your logic doesn't work, you raise your voice? You've beenon Earth too long. You've got to have someone who can cover for you. Hoshi I could order you. I need someone with your ear. Klingon. Ambassador Soval gave us a sampling of theirlinguistic database. They are. but we agreed to make a few compromises. Not much. An empire of warriors with eighty poly-gutturaldialects constructed on an adaptive syntax. Think about it. You'd be the first human to talk to thesepeople. Do you really want someone else to do it? Â TUCKER Since we needed their star charts to get to Kronos. Admiral Forrest says we should think of hermore as a chaperone. Four days there, four days back, then she's gone. In themeantime, we're to extend her every courtesy. Here we go. Come in. Is there a problem? Oh, I forgot. Vulcan females have a heightened sense of smell. I hope Porthos isn't too offensive to you. I'm sorry. This is Commander Charles Tucker the third. Sub-Commander T'Pol. While you may not share our enthusiasm about this mission, Iexpect you to follow our rules. What's said in this room and out onthat Bridge is privileged information. I don't want every word I saybeing picked apart the next day by the Vulcan High Command. Your superiors don't think we can flush a toilet without one ofyou to assist us. That'll be all. Take her out, Mister Mayweather. Straightand steady. How are we doing, Trip? Prepare for warp. Thank you. Let's go. Love what you've done with the place. What'd you think of Earth? I've lived in San Francisco all my life. What's in there? Their droppings? I'm sorry I had to take you away from your programme but, ourdoctors haven't even heard of a Klingon. Ensign Mayweather tells me we'll be to Kronos in about eightyhours. Any chance he'll be conscious by then? Eighty hours, Doctor. If he doesn't walk off this ship on hisown two feet, he doesn't stand much of a chance. The Grand Canyon? Big Sur Aquarium? All work and no play. Everyone should get out for a little funnow and then. Come in. Sit down T'Pol tells me she's been living at the VulcanCompound in Sausalito. Itmight be a little easier using your fingers. Don't worry. We know you're a vegetarian. Enlightened may be too strong a word, but if you'd been onEarth fifty years ago, I think you'd be impressed by what we've gottendone. Human instinct is pretty strong. You can't expect us to changeovernight. Feel what? Bring us to four four, Ensign. It's easy to get a little jumpy when you're travelling atthirty million kilometres a second. Should be old hat in a week's time. Archer. On my way. Hoshi. What's wrong? Tell him we're taking him home. Say it was destroyed. Try the translator again. Bridge, report. Auxiliary power should have kicked in bynow. Do you know how to tell him to shut up? You may have to sedate him. I need to get to the Bridge. Crewman! We've got state of the art sensors. Why thehell didn't we detect them? I want a complete analysis of that disturbance. Where do westand on weapons? What're you waiting for? The Klingon seemed to know who they were. See if you cantranslate what he said. You're the Science Officer. Why don't you help Trip with thatanalysis? We're not going to San Francisco, so make do with what we'vegot here. I didn't lose the Klingon. He was taken, and I'm going to findout who took him. Come with me. I'm not interested in what you think aboutthis mission so take your Vulcan cynicism and bury it along with yourrepressed emotions. I've been listening to you Vulcans tell us what not to do allmy entire life. I watched my father work his ass off while yourscientists held back just enough information to keep him fromsucceeding. He deserved to see that launch. You may have life spans oftwo hundred years, we don't. No, I'm not. And neither are you. Now get the hell out thereand make yourself useful. What have you found, Doctor? Meaning? Are you saying he's some kind of a mutant? It's not in their genome? Any luck? What've you got? Nothing about the Suliban? Does that name ring a bell to you? Well, they have now. Did he say anything about Earth? Jelik, Sarin, Rigel, Tholia. Anything sound familiar? T'Pol? Why the hesitation? Why do I get the feeling you weren't going to share that littlepiece of information? The next time I learn you're withholding something, you'regoing to spend the rest of this voyage confined to some very crampedquarters. Understood? Archer to helm. Go into the Vulcan star charts and find a system called Rigel,then set a course for the tenth planet. As soon as we've tied down, we'll bedescending into the trade complex. It has thirty-six levels. The Vulcans told us Klaang was a courier. If he was there toget something, then whoever gave it to him might know why he was taken. It was only a few days ago. A seven foot Klingon doesn't go unnoticed. This was a one man Klingon scout ship. Humans. We're called humans. Does it say who he was here to see? You don't seem to be very interested in what people do here. Do you have any records of a Suliban vessel coming in aroundthe same time? Go ahead. Where on level nineteen? I'll meet you there as soon as I can. Archer out. Stay behind me. Who the hell are you? I was hoping you could tell me. They looked a lot like yourfriends outside. How come you don't look like your friends? What I'd prefer is that you give me Klaang back. Home. We were just taking him home. You'd better be careful. I'm a lot bigger than you are. What are you doing? You know, under different circumstances, I might be flatteredby this, but. That's never happened before. You're Suliban Evolution? So you know I'm not lying to you. Now what? How do you know that? What kind of message? Why would the Suliban want that? Temporal? You've lost me. What? On the roof. Docking port three. Trip! Come on! Lieutenant Reed, this isArcher. Come in. We're on the roof. You need to get up here as quickly as you can. Get Hoshi to the ship. Now! Go! I said go! How long have? Thanks. That depends. What's been going on the last six hours? Are we underway? You didn't waste much time, didyou? How long before we get back to Earth? You got their plasma decay rate? What happened to this is a foolish mission? As acting Captain, you could've done whatever the hell youwanted to do. Dismissed. Enterprise Starlog, Captain JonathanArcher. April 16th, 2151. We've been tracking the Suliban ship for tenhours, thanks to our Science Officer, who came up with a way to tweakthe sensors. Computer, pause. I save her life, and now she's helping uswith the mission. One good turn deserves another doesn't sound veryVulcan. Resume log. I have no reason to believe that Klaang is stillalive but if what the Suliban woman told me is true, it's crucial thatwe try to find him. Computer, pause. Have you ever known aVulcan to return a favour? No, neither have I. Resume log. I stillhaven't decided whether to ask Sub-Commander T'Pol about this TemporalCold War. My instincts tell me not to trust her. Computer, pause. Archer to T'Pol. Report. From the looks of it, a class six or seven. We've lost them. Move us in closer. Anything? You finished helping us? You heard her. Recalibrate the sensor array. Narrow band, shortto mid range. Your instincts were right. Those fragments weren't from oneSuliban ship How are your targeting scanners? Bring the weapons online and polarise the hull plating. Lay ina sixty degree vector. We're going in. Travis? I wouldn't exactly call this an improvement. It's just a little bad weather. Level off. Go to long range scans. Put it up. What kind of weapons? All sensors. Getwhatever you can. Go tighter. Bio-signs? Just a little trouble with the bad guys. Take us up. What've you got? Even if it is Klaang, we'd have a tough time getting him out ofthere We've risked too much to bring him back inside out. Would thegrappler work in a liquid atmosphere? Bring it online. One more time, Mister Mayweather. Hold your position. Hold your position. Now, Mister Reed. Release the inertial clamps here, here, and here theninitialize the coaxial ports. I don't doubt it, but I need you here. You're gonna have to speed this up a little, Travis. We'll be back before you know it. HaveMayweather plot a course for Kronos. I was beginning to think you understood why we have to do thisalone. Never put off 'til tomorrow. Am I sensing concern? Last time I checked, that was consideredan emotion. Come in. You finished? Ah. Our new weapons. Time to go. The ship is yours. What's that? That's reassuring. Bring the docking interface online. The coaxial ports. Let's go. Bank starboard, ninety degrees. That's the upper support radius. Drop down right below it. Start a counter clockwise sweep. A little more. A little more. Right there. Stun seems to work. Ireally don't want to have to carry you out of here. You okay? I thinkhe gets the idea. Give him a hand. Be quiet. Give me the box. Get to the ship. I'll be right behind you. {Suliban pod]TUCKER It worked, Trip. Still on the central core. Get Klaang backto Enterprise. Get him to the ship. You can come back for me. Believe me, I'll try. What is this room? What goes on in here? Am I supposed to be impressed that you know my name? Well, I guess you have me at a disadvantage. So why don't youdrop this invisible man routine and let me see who I'm talking to? This chameleon thing is pretty fancy. Was it payment forpitting the Klingons against each other, or a trophy from your TemporalCold War. Really? Then you obviously don't know as much about me as youthought you did. What's the matter? No genetic tricksto keep you from getting knocked on your butt? So to speed things up a little, you struck a deal with thedevil. I'll take that as a thank you. What did he say? Come in. I've just gotten a response to themessage I sent to Admiral Forrest. He enjoyed telling the Vulcan HighCommand about the Suliban we ran into. It isn't every day he gets to bethe one dispensing information. I wanted you both to hear Starfleet'sorders before I inform the crew. Your people are sending a transport to pick you up. It would be a little out of our way. Admiral Forrest sees noreason why we shouldn't keep going. I have a feeling Doctor Phlox won't mind staying around for awhile. He's developing a fondness for the human endocrine system. I think that outer hull's going to need a little patching up. Let's hope that's the last time somebody takes a shot at us. T'Pol, would you stick around for a minute? Ever since I canremember, I've seen Vulcans as an obstacle, always keeping us fromstanding on our own two feet. No, I don't think you do. If I'm going to pull this off, thereare a few things I have to leave behind. Things like preconceptions,holding grudges. This mission would've failed without your help. I was thinking. A Vulcan Science Officer could come in handy,but if I asked you to stay it might look like I wasn't ready to do thison my own. Perhaps I should. Permission granted. I hope nobody is in a big hurry to gethome. Starfleet seems to think that we're ready to begin our mission. I understand there's an inhabited planet a few light years from here. That's what we're here to find out. Prepare to break orbit andlay in a course. We can't be afraid of the wind, Ensign. Take us to warp four. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBS. Copyright Â© 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are foreducational and entertainment purposes only.

3,ENT,episode 0,FUTURE,"Where's Klaang? Did you lose anyone else? Our agreement doesn't provide for correcting mistakes. Recover the evidence. Don't be concerned with when. Did Sarin give them anything? What do you know? Looking for Klaang, or for you? We didn't plan to involve the humans or the Vulcans. Notyet. Sarin's message cannot reach Kronos. If the humans have it, youmust stop them."
4,ENT,episode 0,SARIN,"You're looking for Klaang. Why? My name is Sarin. Tell me about the people who took Klaang offyour ship. Where were you taking him? Would you prefer I did? So you could take him where? If you're thinking about harming me, I'd advise against it. Why were you taking Klaang home? I've been given the ability to measure trust, but it requiresclose contact. I'm a member of the Cabal, but not any longer. The price ofevolution was too high. Some of my people are so anxious to improve themselves thatthey've lost perspective. Klaang was carrying a message to his people. I gave it to him. The Suliban have been staging attacks within the Klingon Empire,making it appear that one faction is attacking another. Klaang wasbringing proof of this to his High Council. Without that proof, theEmpire could be thrown into chaos. The Cabal doesn't make decisions on its own. They're simplysoldiers fighting a Temporal Cold War. They're taking orders from the distant future. We can help you find Klaang but we don't have a starship. You'llhave to take us with you. Where's your vessel? This way. Find Klaang."

Bigger than Ambassador Pointy's ship? Well, Billy Cook said we'd be flying at warp five by now ifthe Vulcans hadn't kept things from us. I can't do it! Damn."

10,ENT,episode 0,REED,"I presume you mean fruits and vegetables. I don't think I'm quite ready to have my molecules compressedinto a data stream. Do they indeed. Well, I certainly hope the Captain doesn't planon making us use it. This is ridiculous. I asked forplasma coils and they sent me a case of valve sealant. There's nochance I can have these weapons online in three days. Didn't you read the profile report on these Klingons? Apparently,they sharpen their teeth before they go into battle. No doubt Mister Tucker will reassure me thatmy equipment will be here tomorrow. Keep your shirt on, Lieutenant. Feels all right. Earth sea level. After being raised on cargo ships, it must've felt like you hadlead in your boots when you got to Earth. I believe you missed a spot. Commander Tucker, Ensign TravisMayweather. He just arrived. Pardon me, but if I don't realign the deflector, the first grainof space dust we come across will blow a hole through this ship thesize of your fist. Not much of a change. The deflector's sequencing. It's perfectly normal. I think I just saw something off the starboard bow. I don't know. It might have just been the sensors going down. The starboard sensor logs recorded a spatial disturbance. I still have to tune the targeting scanners. Are those real butterflies, or some kind of holograms? Yes. Absolutely. Right. Inter-species performance? Perhaps another time. We are explorers. You're breaking up, can't read. We've been trying to reach you, Captain. We're back in theshuttle. Captain, what's your location? The weather is definitely I've never seen lightning in a snowstormbefore. Try Vulcan biosigns. Your appendages blister, peel and turn gangrenous. Let me see. Doctor Phlox may have to amputate. The radiation's dissipated their warp trail. I'm only picking upfragments. There's too much distortion. The decay rates don't even match. Sir? Aligned and ready, sir. Impulse and warp engines. We're too far away. That was a particle weapon, sir. We could always try the transporting device. I believe so. The ventral plating's down! The lead ship's closing. Seven thousand metres. Six thousand. One thousand metres. Forward plating's offline. The ship's in the launch bay. Sir. This should reverse thepolarity of anymag-lock within a hundredmetres. Once you've set the sequence, you'll have five seconds. Onemore thing. They're called phase pistols. They have two settings, stun andkill. It would be best not to confuse them. Hold on. If we change our position, they'll have to start from scratch. This is ridiculous! If we don't move the ship, Captain Archerwon't have anything to look for when he gets back. The charges are getting closer again. All I hear is noise. Hull plating's been re-polarised. We have four more coming up off starboard. We've detected it, sir. Sensors show a nitrogen sulfideatmosphere."
11,ENT,episode 0,ALIEN,"Would you like to meet them? I can arrange it. I'll show you where, but first you should enjoy yourselves. Which one would you prefer? Of course I do, but there's no reason to hurry."
12,ENT,episode 0,SOVAL,"We don't know. They were incinerated in the methane explosion,and the farmer's description was vague at best. The Klingons made it very clear they want us to expedite this. You will be apprised of all pertinent information. When he was nearly killed by your ""farmer."" Sarcasm aside, Captain, the last thing your people need is tomake an enemy of the Klingon Empire. Klaang's culture finds honour in death. If they saw him likethis he'd be disgraced. The Klingons have demanded that we return Klaang immediately. This is no time to be imposing your ethical beliefs. Admiral. Listen to me. You're making a mistake!"
13,ENT,episode 0,T'POL,"Until you've proven you're ready, To look beyond your provincial attitudes and volatile nature. This confirms that I was formally transferred to your command atoh eight hundred hours. Reporting for duty. No, sir. I've been trained to tolerate offensive situations. I'll try to remember that. My reason for being here is not espionage. My superiors simplyasked me to assist you. I didn't request this assignment Captain, and you can be certainthat when the mission's over I'll be as pleased to leave this ship asyou'll be to have me go. If there's nothingelse? The coordinates are off by point two degrees. No. Sightseeing was not one of my assignments. All our recreational needs are provided at the Compound. Vulcans don't touch food with their hands. You humans claim to be enlightened, yet you still consume theflesh of animals. You have yet to embrace either patience or logic. You remainimpulsive carnivores. It remains to be seen whether humanity will revert to its baserinstincts. With proper discipline, anything's possible. You're imagining it. Perhaps you'd like to go to your quarters and lie down? I was instructed to speak English during this voyage, and I'dappreciate it if you'd respect that. We've dropped out of warp, sir. Main power is What? Captain. Captain. There's no way you could have anticipated this. I'msure Ambassador Soval will understand. The astrometric computer in San Francisco will be far moreeffective. You've lost the Klingon. Your mission is over. How do you plan to do that? Space is very big, Captain. A shadowon your sensors won't help you find them. This is a foolish mission. Your reaction to this situation is a perfect example of why yourspecies should remain in its own star system. You are going to be contacting Starfleet to advise them of oursituation. It's just background noise. Your sensors aren't capable ofisolating plasma decay. Vulcan children play with toys that are more sophisticated. Your Captain's mission was to return the Klingon to his people. He no longer has the Klingon. My analysis of the spatial disturbance Mister Reed saw indicatesa stealth vessel with a tricyclic plasma drive. Unfortunately, your sensors were not designed to measure plasmadecay. They're a somewhat primitive species from Sector three six fourone, but they've never posed a threat. Rigel is a planetary system approximately fifteen light yearsfrom our present position. According to the navigational logs salvaged from Klaang's ship,Rigel ten was the last place he stopped before crashing on your planet. I wasn't authorised to reveal the details of our findings. Your translators have been programmed for Rigelian. However,you'll encounter numerous other species. Many of them are known to beimpatient with newcomers. None of them have seen a human before. Youhave a tendency to be gregarious. I suggest you try to restrain thattendency. Doctor Phlox isn't concerned with the food and water, but hedoes caution against intimate contact. It's nothing that concerns us. T'Pol to Archer. Central Security claims to have no record of Klaang, but theytold me about an enclave on level nineteen where Klingons have beenknown to go. Something about live food. The easternmost subsection, by the geothermal shafts. Don't get involved. They're Lorillians. Before the age of four, they can onlybreathe methyloxide. The mother is simply weaning her son. Humans can't refrain from drawing conclusions. You should learnto objectify other cultures, so you know when to interfere, and whennot to. Â ALIEN No, it's this way! Enterprise needs its Captain! Give me the weapons! Ignore it. Take us up. Open a channel. Sub-Commander T'Pol toEnterprise. We'll be docking in four minutes. Have Doctor Phlox meet us indecon. The Captain. I'm taking command of Enterprise. Tell Mister Mayweather to prepare to leave orbit. My Vulcan rank supersedes yours. As soon as we're through here, I'll contact Ambassador Soval. He'll speak to your superiors and I'm certain they'll support myauthority in this situation. Your precious cargo was stolen. three Suliban, perhaps more,were killed, and Captain Archer has been seriously wounded. It seems tome this mission has put an end to itself. Turn around. I fail to see your point. You obviously share your Captain's belief that my people wereresponsible for impeding Henry Archer's accomplishments. As your highest ranking officer I assumed command while you wereincapacitated. Is he fit to resume command? We're currently tracking the Suliban vessel that left Rigelshortly after you were injured. With Mister Tucker's assistance, I modified the sensors. You nowhave the resolution to detect their warp trail. It is a foolish mission. The Suliban are clearly a hostile racewith technology far superior to yours, but as acting Captain, I wasobligated to anticipate your wishes. I should return to the Bridge. Match their speed. Mister Tucker. Would you please give the helmsmanpermission to go to warp four point five. If you're feeling well enough to come to the Bridge,Captain, now would be a good time. It's a gas giant. Class seven. The Suliban vessel dropped to impulse a few hoursago and altered course. Their new heading took them through its outerradiation belt. Yes. Lieutenant, run a spectral analysis of the fragments. Calculate the trajectory of each fragment. Measure the particle density of the thermosphere. They were from fourteen, and all within the last six hours. Ibelieve we have found what we're looking for. Our situation should improve. We're about to break through thecyclohexane layer. Liquid phosphorous. I wouldn't have expected that beneath alayer of cyclohexane. I'm detecting two vessels bearing one one nine mark seven. I suggest we return to the phosphorous layer. Captain. It appears to be an aggregate structure comprised of hundreds ofvessels. They're held in place by an interlocking system of magneticseals. We can't be certain they're Klingon. We should ascend. Captain, That charge contained a proximity sweep. If we remainhere, they're going to locate us. There's a Vulcan ship less than two days away. It's illogical toattempt this alone. You'll have other opportunities to demonstrate your independence. You both could be killed. If anything happens to either of you, the Vulcan High Commandwill hold me responsible. If we change our position, the Captain will have no way offinding us. We're going to need that ear of yours. Move us away fivekilometres. Any direction. Another five kilometres, Lieutenant. Amplify it. Coordinates, one fifty eight mark one three. Ahead, fifty kph. Shaya tonat. Initiate docking procedures. Our mission is to return the Klingon to his homeworld. Anotherrescue attempt couldjeopardize that mission. As Commanding Officer, it's my job to interpret the Captain'sorders. Captain Archer may very well have told you to return for himlater because he knew how stubborn you can be. You might've risked Klaang's life in a foolish attempt to swingback and rescue the Captain. The situation must be analysed logically. That is a specious analogy. Stand by impulse engines. Mister Tucker, status. That should suffice. If the Suliban have re-established theirdefences, we'll have no other option. Can we dock, Ensign? Mister Tucker, we're going to plan B. Now! I was under the impression that Enterprise would be taking meback to Earth. I understand. I won't dispute that. Perhaps you should add pride to your list. It might be best if I were to contact my superiors and make therequest myself. With your permission."
14,ENT,episode 0,TUCKER,"The ventral plating team says they'll be done in about threedays. You planning to sit on the hull and pose for some postcards? And fast. Warp four point five next Thursday. Give me a second. Sorry. Orbital six. Beautiful. Lock it off right there. Our space boomer. Warp four. We'll be going to four five as soon as we clearJupiter. Think you can handle it? Keep your shirt on, Lieutenant. Your equipment'll be here inthe morning. So we get a few maps and they get to put a spy on our ship? I thought the whole point of this was to get away from theVulcans. I don't know. I'd be more comfortable with Porthos on theBridge. I took a shower this morning. How about you, Captain? Trip. I'm called Trip. Ready when you are. You're upside down, Ensign. Care to explain why? Sweet spot? Wow! Slept? The Captain tells me you've been to Trillius Prime. I've only been to one inhabited planet besides Earth. Nothingthere but dust-dwelling ticks. I've heard the women on Draylax have. You know that first-hand? I guess growing up a boomer has its advantages. Sorry. Dinner with the boss tonight. You should've started without me. No kidding. I lived a few blocks from there when I first joinedStarfleet. Great parties at the Vulcan Compound. Can't wait to see you tackle the spare ribs. Looks delicious. Tell Chef I said thanks. Grandma taught me never to judge a species by their eatinghabits. Yeah? How about war, disease, hunger. Pretty much wiped 'em outin less than two generations. I wouldn't call that small potatoes. Well, we used to have cannibals on Earth. Who knows how farwe'll revert? Lucky this isn't a long mission. Looks more like a glitch. How about this? How can you be so damn sure what our sensors can do? You know, some people say that you Vulcans do nothing butpatronise us, but if they were here now, if they could see how faryou're bending over backwards to help me, they'd eat their words. I realize he's only a simple Earthling but did it ever occur toyou that he might know what he's doing? It's no secret Starfleet hasn'tbeen around too long. God knows you remind us of that every chance youget, but does that mean the man who's been put in charge of thismission doesn't deserve our support? Then again, loyalty's an emotion,isn't it? Not really. If we can figure out the decay rate of their plasma, we'll beable to find their warp trail. You forgot to warn us about drinking the water. What in the world? Hey. What are you doing? Leave thekid alone! Do you see what she's doing? He's going to suffocate! Could've fooled me. Over here! Like I said, it's back there. Is this really necessary? How's the Captain? Will he be all right? Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you just kind of anobserver on this mission? I don't remember anyone telling me you were amember of Starfleet. Apples and oranges. This is an Earth vessel. You're in noposition to take command. You must really be proud of yourself. You can put an end tothis mission while the Captain's still unconscious in Sickbay. Youwon't even have to look him in the eye. Let's say you're right. Let's say we screwed up just like youalways knew we would. It's still a pretty good bet that whoever blewthat hole in the Captain's leg is connected somehow to the people whotook Klaang. Captain Archer deserves a chance to see this through. If youknew him, you'd realise that's what he's about. He needs to finish whathe starts. His daddy was the same way. He only wanted to see his engine fly. They never even gave hima chance to fail. Here you are, thirty years later, proving just howconsistent you Vulcans can be. How are you doing, Captain? Earth, sir? Modifying the sensors was her idea, sir. Engineering. It's okay, Travis.

What about you, sir? It's going to be hard to isolate your biosigns, so stay as faraway from the Suliban. As you can. I don't particularly like the way you smell, either. I don't get it, this is right where they're supposed to be. Turn this ship around. Now. The Captain specifically told us to come back for him. I just told you his orders. What's there to interpret? What the hell is that supposed to mean? I can't believe this! I don't remember the Captain analyzing anything when he wentback for you on that roof. Is it. The auto-sequencer's online but annularconfinement's still off by two microns. Easy for you to say. Bridge, we've got him! Sorry, Captain. Wehad no other choice. Orders? Son of a bitch.

On the contrary. I could've told you what day you were going todie but I suppose that's about to change. What you call tricks we call progress.

Look atthis lung. Five bronchial lobes, you see. It should only have three. And look at the alveoli clusters. They've been modified to processdifferent kinds of atmospheres. Yes, I suppose I am, but this was no accident, no freak ofnature. This man was the recipient of some very sophisticated geneticengineering. Watch this. Subcutaneous pigment sacs. A bio-mimeticgarment. And, the eyes are my favorite. Compound retinas. He mostlikely saw things even your sensors couldn't detect. No, certainly not. The Suliban are no more evolved than humans.

When Zefram Cochrane made his legendarywarp flight ninety years ago, and drew the attention of our newfriends, the Vulcans. We realised that we weren't alone in the galaxy. Today we're about to cross a new threshold. For nearly a century, we'vewaded ankle-deep in the ocean of space. Now it's finally time to swim. The warp five engine wouldn't be a reality without men likeDoctor Cochrane and Henry Archer, who worked so hard to develop it. Soit's only fitting that Henry's son, Jonathan Archer, will command thefirst starship powered by that engine. Rather than quoting Doctor Cochrane, I think we shouldlisten to his own words from the dedication ceremony for the Warp FiveComplex thirty two years ago. On this site, a powerful engine will be built. Anengine that will someday help us travel a hundred times faster than wecan today. Imagine it. Thousands of inhabited planets at our fingertips.

See if you can find another hatch. Diameter? Scan for biosigns. Humanoid? Mister Reed, how long to prep a shuttle? Get started. Suit up, Ensign. The ship is yours. Is there a problem, Commander?

They were crewmen, murdered on their own ship. Fifteen deadcrewmen. What's the matter, the tension bothering you? Must be great not to let things bother you. No remorse, noguilt.

Don't you think maybe youwould have taken them down, tried to figure out who they were, madesome effort to contact their families? We didn't even try. What about you, what if theywere humans? Would you just stick your tail between your legs and run,leave them there to rot? Am I the only one who's having a problem withthis? So we should avoid confrontation cost, is that what you'resaying?

There's somethingto be learned from every lifeform. I promise to do my best to keep it alive. Actually I was thinking more about my pyrithian bat. He won'teat anything once it's dead. This should do fine. No. Please, sit down, sit down. I'm afraid not. Try the potatoes, they're delicious. Yes. The flavour's remarkable. On my homeworld, people wouldnever think of speaking during a meal. Considered a waste of time. It'staken me a while, but I've grown quite attached to it. Antsy? Every moment's been an adventure for me. Humans are sounpredictable. Have you seen the quantities of food Crewman Namodconsumes? Have you smelled Ensign Socorro after she exercises? She givesoff a fragrance not unlike the adrenal gland of a Nausicaan. AndCrewmen Bennett and Haynem over there. Do you see them? If I'm not mistaken, they arepreparing to mate. Do you think they might let me watch? They're clean. Not long after I became a physician, therewas an explosion on a cargo ship orbiting my homeworld. I was part ofthe first medical team to arrive. There were seventeen bodies on theBridge alone. I'd never seen that many dead people in one place before. Very disturbing. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all frightened by unfamiliar things. You should begrateful that your body of experience doesn't include rooms full ofcorpses. Not so far. She has been under a great deal of stress, but I'mhoping this protein concentrate whets her appetite. It goes without saying that you're going to encounter theunexpected. Have you ever considered that you might be happier back at theuniversity, teaching? I did it for years. It was quite rewarding. If she doesn't take these nutrients I'm afraid she won'tsurvive. It's close enough. It might be easier just to feed her to my bat. Perhaps some place where she could teach. Not at all. I'll see what I can do, Captain. Different ways. This one was given a lethal dose of chloraxine. The first three back there were shot. Particle weapons, I believe. Thisfellow hasn't suffered as much cellular decay. He's our best candidatefor a post-mortem. Care to assist? Just what Ithought. A zymuth gland. It releases triglobulin into the blood. That'swhat all these tubes and pumps are about. Whoever did this is trying tocollect triglobulin. Oh, for any number of reasons. To create medicines, vaccines,some species have even been known to use it as an aphrodisiac. It's quite a common practice. I'm surprised you're not familiarwith it. It's worth noting that triglobulin is very similar to humanlymphatic fluid. A sub-molecular bio-scan. You've been probed, Ensign. We've allbeen probed. They have no doubt discovered that your lymphatic systemscontain some useful compounds."

57,ENT,episode 1,HOSHI,"Wish I did. She doesn't look any better, does she. I should have left her where I found her. She wasn't meant to be in this environment. He's going to make you all better. Doctor Phlox thinks this argon lamp should help. She's barelymoved all day. I'm sorry. No, sir, but the Doctor's doing the best he can. Sir, myquarters are on E deck, starboard section five. The stars are going the wrong way, sir. On both my training tours, I had port side quarters. I'm havingtrouble sleeping. The wrong side of the ship, yes, sir. I spoke with EnsignPorter. He said he's be willing to switch, with your permission. I appreciate it, Captain. No, sir. Thank you. No, sir. I'll try it again. No response, sir. She may have a point, Captain. I could try hailing them ontheta-band frequencies. Me, sir? Sorry to bother you, sir. No, thank you. Sir? Yes, that's fine, thank you. I was thinking, Captain, I might bea lot more helpful to you if I stay here and keep an open comm. link. That way I'll have immediate access to the linguistic database. It's not the same. The lag time is tripled. The environmental suits. They make me a little claustrophobic. You talked me into it, remember. Well, I just, I bit my lip and got through it. Yes, sir. No, I'd better get back to the Launch Bay. I've been cleared on EM sidearms and class three pulse rifles. I've never seen one of those. Is this necessary? Enterprise, we've got access. We're boarding the vessel. Well, at least we know they're bipeds. The ladder. There's power going through here, but not much of it. Blood? These icons look like they represent frequency bands. If it is, it's offline. Maybe that's why they didn't answer ourhails. And what's this? I don't think you need a translator. I screamed like a twelve year old. Nobody else screamed. Has she been eating? I'm a translator. I didn't come out here to see corpses hangingon hooks. Not corpses on hooks. I'm an exo-linguist. I graduated second in my class. I spentthree years in Starfleet training. I was Jonathan Archer's first choicefor this mission. Every inhabited world we come to is going to befilled with language. Some will have hundreds of them. He needs mehere. Are you sure that's what she eats? I shouldn't have brought her on board. Maybe I could ask theCaptain to try to find a planet with an argon rich atmosphere. She needs to get back to an environment that is more suited toher. Captain. Maybe it's a log. What do you think? The grammar sounds bimodal. Let's hope. Ship. Ship. How long before the transceiver's online? The quicker we get this done, the quicker we can get back to theship. Yeah, great. Distress. Two other teachers and I once took a hydro-skimmer outonto a small tributary in the Amazon. You know, to see the wildlife. Sloths, pink dolphins, all kinds of snakes. It gave me the creeps. If I didn't like being around anacondas,you can imagine how I feel about Suliban or whoever butchered the crewof this ship. I'm going to ask the Captain to take me home. I should have never left the university. I'm not suited forthis. You weren't here yesterday. I saw those bodies and fell apart. The Captain needs a translator he can count on. Someone who shows alittle grace under pressure. That isn't me. Oh yes I can. Distress. Distress. UT I think I've got it. Ship in distress. UT They're hailing us. I told him what you said, sir, but I doubt it made any sense. This isn't exactly Spanish we're dealing with here. I'd be luckyif I'm getting half the vocabulary right. It seems he got the part about killing the cargo ship crew buthe believes we did it, sir. At least I think he does. I think I understood this one. He says the distress call camefrom his ship, not ours. Something about scans. He wants to know why we were theretwo years ago. He probably means two days, sir. The phonetic processor's stillhaving trouble locking on. I'm not certain, but I don't think he'sgoing to help us. I'm having trouble with the word pump, sir. I've got theprocessor searching for synonyms. The translator's not making a wholelot of sense to him, sir. He's getting frustrated. I think he's runningout of patience, Captain. Do what myself? That's impossible, sir. I haven't even learned their basicconjugations. You don't understand. I don't even know how to say pump. I'llget it all wrong, it'll just make things worse. Sir. Uta doi ura. Uta lora ista. Urasta mistavor. This isn't exactly like the place you came from, but it's closeenough. It's not that hard to adapt. You're going to do just fine here. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

I hope you don't expect everyone we run into out here to behostile. In twenty three years I don't think my folks ran into aproblem more than a half dozen times. Do you think that makes a difference? Seems like everybody else on board is itching for a firstcontact. Yes, sir. We made a trip once from Livinius to Belarn Prime. Two and a half light years. Nearly nine months without running into asoul. There were five kids on board. We were at each others throatswithin a matter of weeks. First officer and my mother came up with theidea to teach us how to play geography. You know, you say Amazon River,which ends in an R. I say Rhode Island. X, X. Don't tell me, I know an X. Xanadu. Doesn't matter. Well, you used an alien planet, Dralax. Point five microns. Range, five thousand kilometres. Are those venting ports or hull breaches? Maybe they're in trouble. Sick or something. Mayweather here, sir. Aye, sir. We've reversed course, sir. We should beback at the coordinates in five hours. Distance, sixty thousand kilometres. Ten minutes, maybe less. The pod's on the arm. We're dead in the water, sir. What was that? Sir, another vessel just dropped out of warp. They're on an intercept course. I can't, sir. Their beam's disrupting all our propulsionsystems.

Prep a shuttlepod, Mister Tucker. Ilike the looks of the northern continent. See if you can find a goodplace to set down. Protocols. How long would all that take? I understand that you have a more cautious approach, but wedidn't come out here to tip-toe around. Get the pod ready. I'd like you to put together the survey team. I assumethat's not a violation of protocol? Set us down just east of those hills. I almost forgot what fresh air smells like. Put that thing away. Take a minute to enjoy yourself. The skyever get this blue on Vulcan? We're walking on an alien world light years from Earth orVulcan. Doesn't that impress you? Smile. Be sure to get a copyof that to the Vulcan High Command. I'm afraid my log entry isn't going to do this justice. Three weeks in deep space, you're ready to jump ship? Archer. No, no problem. Why? Sorry, we lost track of time. We'll beright there. I'm glad to see you're getting into the spirit of things. Pickyou up in the morning. Why can't it be a little bit of both? Research isn't the onlyreason we're out here. Pitch your tent, Commander. Come in. Nice catch. You'd make a good two metre man. Too bad we don't have a pool on board. Survey team? Archer to T'Pol. What's your status? Mister Reed thinks we should come down and get you. We'll keep an eye on the storm. Let usknow if you need anything. Keep the pod on standby, just in case. Can you make it back to the cavern? Archer to Novakovich. Ethan, respond. This is Captain Archer. We're attempting to land. I wantyou to get back to the cavern. We're closing in on your position, Trip. There's aclearing a hundred metres from the cave entrance. Get to it. I'm taking us down. There's a lot of wind shear near thesurface. Activate the auxiliary landing thrusters. Altitude seventymetres, forty metres. I'll have to trya different vector. I see it. Almost there. Archer to Tucker. We're going to have to wait Until the wind dies down. Try to managetill then. If you run across Any more of these aliens, try to makecontact. See what you can find out about them. How's he doing? Try him again. Mister Reed, can you get a lock on him? Looks like our only choice. Can I talk to him? No. If it was down on the planet, why didn't our sensors pick itup? How long will the effects last? Will this tro- Will it affect T'Pol as well? Archer to T'Pol. We have Novakovich. What? What are you talking about? Listen to me. You've all been exposed to apsychotropic compound. It causes heightened anxiety Hallucinations. The compound comes from the pollen of aflower. We think it was blown down from the mountains when the windstarted. The doctor's run tests on Novakovich. He thinks he's going tobe okay in a few hours. So if you can get As deep as you can into the caves,your symptoms should dissipate around the same times. You dealt with simulations very close tothis in Starfleet training. You're familiar with mind-altering agents. We'll be down to get you as soon as the winds let up. Put your weapon down, Trip. That's anorder. T'Pol? Have you been affected? Try to hold on. Archer out. Get to the Bridge. I want a weatherreport. When's that? Go ahead. I thought you said he was going to befine. What about the others? I've got four people down on the surface, Doctor. I need toknow if they're going to be dead when we get there in the morning. How are you doing? It's the Captain, Trip. Are you all right? Both of you listen to me very carefully. Novakovich may bedying. Turnsout the pollen contains some kind oftoxin our sensors hadn't detected. He's responding to medication, buthis odds of recovery would be a hell of a lot better if we'd treatedhim sooner. The Doctor and Malcolm are synthesizing ampoules ofinoprovalene. We're going to have to use the transporter to get it toyou, but it's imperative that you inoculate yourselves as soon aspossible. Do you understand what I'm saying? What's going on, Hoshi? Trip, listen to me. The pollen's affecting her too. Thinkabout it. You've heard of people suffering from dementia who revert totheir native language. She can't help it. Trip, how long have we known each other? Remember when your EV pack froze up onTitan during the Omega training mission? You got nitrogen narcosis. Youstarted to try to take off your helmet. You remember what I'm talkingabout? I ordered you to keep your helmet on. You were delirious, thought you were goingto die, but you obeyed that order because you trusted me. I'm asking you to trust me now. Take the injection, then we'll deal withthese rock people. Trip! All right. Forget the medicine. I think it's time Iexplain what's really going on, but just stand by for a minute. I needMalcolm to target your position. Then I'll give you your orders. Archer to Phlox. The sooner The better. All right, Trip. This is a major breach of security, but I'mgoing to have to trust you. Starfleet sent us here to make contact with a silicon-basedlife form. T'Pol was the only person granted clearance To speak with them. Seems they've metVulcans before. When a mission's classified top secret, Idon't ask why. We never thought the storm would drive you into the caves. That's where these rock people live. They didn't want anybody in thereexcept for T'Pol, so they're not too happy right now. I'm sure you canunderstand that. They've even threatened to destroyEnterprise. Now, T'Pol needs to explain to them why you're all there,but she's not going to have much credibility with you pointing a phasepistol at her. If they agree to listen to her, you'llneed to lower your weapon. If they don't, I'm going to have Malcolmdestroy the cavern. Sacrificing four more crewmen is a small price topay to save Enterprise. Now, I'm going to ask Hoshi to tell T'Pol everything I justtold you in Vulcan. You got a problem with that? Ensign. Hope she knows the difference between stunand kill. They've agreed to talk to her, Trip, solower your weapon And act real friendly."

79,ENT,episode 2,T'POL,"Seventeen percent oxygen, eighty one percent nitrogen. The planet supports a diverse ecology, but there are no signs ofhumanoid life. Captain. There are a number of protocols you may want toconsider. Vulcan ships would begin by sending automated probes down tocollect more detailed scans. If the planet proved to be Minshara-class,we would then conduct a geophysical survey from orbit. Six or seven days. This planet has been here a long time. It will still be here inseven days. Did you sterilise the sample containers? You were selected because your specialty is entomology. Thisplanet has a diverse insect population. The atmosphere contains trace elements of nitrogen dioxide,chloromethane. Occasionally. I've been to thirty six Minshara class planets. This experienceis only marginally different. You have your assignments. We'll rendezvous here at nineteenhundred hours, unless the Captain wants us to pose for more pictures. Is there a problem, Captain? We were scheduled to rendezvous fifteen minutes ago. We've identified several nocturnalmarsupials. I'd like to keep crewmen Cutler and Novakovich with meovernight to study them. This isn't shore leave, this is a research mission. It's highly doubtful that a distress beacon could functioncontinuously for sixty three years. Certainly. A front is approaching from the south west. T'Pol to Tucker. Is there a problem, Commander? Do you require assistance? Less than half a kilometre from here. Yes, Captain. We've relocated into a cavern. A landing under these circumstances might be difficult. We'll beprotected until the winds diminish. Understood. We must have left them at the campsite. We've scanned the planet, it's uninhabited. Other than ourselves, there are no humanoid life forms here. It's functioning perfectly. Perhaps you imagined seeing them. Where do you propose we go, back out into the storm? I'll be back shortly. If there's someone back there, I intend to find them. Excuse me? Talking to? There's no one here. I performed a geological analysis. The rocks are composed oflimestone and cormalite, nothing more. She's mistaken. I have no reason to deceive you. I can't explain what you've seen, but I assure you I didn'tspeak to anyone. Your point? This is pointless. I share your concern for crewman Novakovich, but as I told you Your emotions are beginning to affect your judgment. You'rebecoming irrational. That won't be necessary. Idetected water about sixty metres in that direction. Join me if you'd like. I can survive without water for several days. Can you? Working. Scans I took this afternoon. There's nothing of scientific interest on this planet. Ourmission here was a waste of time. The readings are in Vulcan. You won't understand them. Of what? I was wrong. There is something of interest here. I've learned agreat deal about human behaviour. Under stress, you become volatile. You're a far more dangerousspecies than I previously believed. I didn't ask you or Mister Tucker to join us. There's no one there, Commander. All I see is a delusional engineer. Yes, Captain. And I have a phase pistol pointed at my head. He's lowered his phase pistol, sir. Yes, but only slightly.   T'Pol. He's irrational, sir. Mayweather and Cutler are nearlyunconscious.    I'm afraid I did. They were never here. There were no rock people. You were all hallucinating. Yes. The Captain felt that if I played along, it might help topersuade you to lower your weapon. You'd grown increasingly illogicaland violent. Something about splitting me in two. You were under the influence of the pollen. We all were. Commander?"
80,ENT,episode 2,TUCKER,"Sounds like home. You expect us to sit up here for a weekwhile probes have all the fun? You'd have better luck making friends with a housefly. Wow. Where no dog has gone before. Perfect. Hold it right there. A cabin in these woods would be nice. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. You guys would be lostwithout me. Boomers. Captain, if it's all right with you, Travis and I'd like tostay as well. When was the last time you slept under the stars? There'splenty of camping gear in the pod. Thanks, Captain. Don't worry, we'll keep out of yourhair. Those were retired decades ago. Of course it was cold. It was floating in space for sixtyyears. Let me guess. No ghost stories on Vulcan. What? When I was a kid I'd go camping with my buddies. We'd spendhalf the night looking up at the stars wondering what our own sun wouldlook like from this far away. Has anyone heard the one about the haunted comet? Nice going, Travis, you scared off the bugs. Looks like we might have ourselves a little weather. This is nothing compared to a hurricane coming up through theFlorida Keys. Ow! Son of a bitch! There's something in my bag. Give me your boot. So I can squash it. If they're inside your sleeping bag. There it is, wait a minute. Where'd you put the phasepistols? I'm just going to stun it. Go ahead. Oh no, just an eight inch scorpion thinginside our tent. I think I've got it under control. No not there, it's over there. T'Pol, you said you found a cave thisafternoon. I think we're going to need it. Who's got the food packs? Travis? Be careful. Just you, why? I think we've had enough ghost stories for one night. Sub-commander? We don't know that. They could be friendly. Slow down, crewman. That's an order. Stay here. Travis. Travis! I saw one. It came right out of that rock like it was apart of it. It's too dangerous. We should go back. We've lost Novakovich and we'reapparently not alone. There's some kind of lifeform down here. We're heading there now, sir. Not a moment too soon. From what I saw, these things liveinside the rock. Crewman? Neither does she. You keep claiming these creatures don'texist, but the rest of us have all seen them. That's a little strange,don't you think? I'd like to believe you, but you Vulcans don't exactly have aspotless track record when it comes to being honest with us. You've held things back before. You might be doing it again. Tucker here. Captain, aren't you forgetting something? We'll do our best, sir. Understood. You heard the Captain. He wants to know about your friends. What are you going to tell him? What are you going to tell him? Is it? We're stuck down here for God knows how long with abunch of rock people who, for all we know, are staring at us from thesewalls right now. Not to mention a crewman out there who probably won'tlast the night. Now if we're going to get through this, I need to knowwhat the hell's going on. You beginning to see my point? You couldn't care less about him or any of the rest of us. Thatwould require some of those useless human emotions. You've never seen me irrational. Great. We'll have to conserve what's left. How do we know you're not going in there to talk to yourfriends? Sit down. Youheard me. What are you doing? On what. Find anything you want to tell me about? That's what you'd like us to think. Let me see that thing. No, but Hoshi would. This could be evidence. Your little conspiracy. Oh? Your people have been telling us that kind of crap for ahundred years. Looks like you finally found a way to put us back in ourcage. Imagine the news back home, Travis. Enterprise crew found dead. Six weeks into their historic voyage, the bodies of all eighty twocrewmembers were located on an uninhabited world. A Vulcan ship madethe unfortunate discovery. Cause of death remains a mystery. But whatthe Vulcans won't say is they know exactly who attacked us. In fact,they arranged the whole thing. They lured us down here so they couldsabotage our mission. We know you're here. Why don't you show yourselves? You're notafraid of us, are you? Maybe you're waiting for the others to come down so you cankill us all at once. Did you see that? Sounds like you're getting a little volatile yourself,Sub-Commander. I thought you had your emotions all locked up. Having alittle problem, are you? You think I'm going to wait around here for you to slaughterus? I'll blow this whole cave apart if I have to. I know you hear me! My suspicions were Right on the nose, Captain. Our littleVulcan here is Not what she appears to be. Neverwas. There's some kind of Creatures down here. They hide insidesolid rock. Travis and I have both seen them. Cutler saw two of themtalking to T'Pol. They're up to something but of course, she denies it. Are you telling me those creatures aren't real? We didn't imagine this, Captain. You're not down here, Captain. You don't understand what's going on. Travis. You still with me? Ineed you on your feet. Those things could come back at any time. Listento me. I'm giving you an order. What's wrong? Ensign? What'dyou do to him? I can see why you get along so well with them, sneakingaround in the shadows. That's second nature to you Vulcans, isn't it. I have no idea what you just said, but it didn't sound verynice. You're making a mistake working with her. She'll stab you in theback first chance she gets. Tell you what. Come out and we'll settlethis peacefully. Whatever she told you about humans, it's not true. Youcan see for yourself. Say something! What are you doing her? Yes, sir. I know, I know, but they're notgiving me much choice. I've got to protect my crew. I understand,Mister Velik, but I can't do that. They're trying to kill us. Nice try. Stay awake, Travis. I can't afford to have you going out on me. Cutler, you okay? If you're waiting for me to passout, you're wasting your time. You might as well have your friends comeout now, do whatever they're going to do. Who's that? Taking an injection isn't going to changea damn thing, don't you see that? They're planning something, Captain. First us, then all of you. Say one more word of that gibberish andI'm going to split you in two. The only thing that's affecting her are those rock people. If Ican stop her now, I can save Enterprise. What's that got to do with anything? What's your point! Too late, Captain. I'm not going to die with a hypospray in myhand. No! It's not going to happen. Captain? Hello? I'm waiting for that order But I can't wait much longer. Go ahead. Why couldn't you tell me that? If it was so top secret, then why'd you let us all come down tothe surface? Let us spend the night? I understand. Go ahead. You didn't shoot me last night, did you? Are they gone? The pollen? Then what about that speech you gave to the wall? A pretty good performance. Look, I know I kind of shot my mouthoff last night. Challenge you preconceptions or they'll challenge you. That's something Mister Velik used to say. Tenth grade biologyclass.

93,ENT,episode 2,TRAVIS,"Yes, sir. Minshara-class? Aye sir. It's beautiful all right, but I couldn't call a place homeunless it came with a pair of warp nacelles. We would? Keep in mind those cargo vessels weren'tequipped for rescue operations, so the Captain wasn't sure what to dowhen he picked up the distress call. But it wasn't a ship that sent thesignal. It was a life-pod from one of the old Y-500-class freighters. Exactly. The pod had been drifting in space for sixty threeyears. Bioscans showed one lifesign inside the pod. Human. Theassistant engineer, George Webb, a friend of my uncle's, was assignedto open it. Took him over an hour to cut through the hull. He said themetal felt strange, cold to the touch. He could hear a tapping noise coming from inside, but when hefinally got it open the pod was empty. No body, nothing. A few dayslater, Webb started acting strange, getting into fights with the crew,muttering to himself in some sort of alien language. Then one day helocked himself in Engineering and overloaded the impulse reactors. Healmost destroyed the ship. Then he sealed himself in a life pod andejected it. The reactors were too badly damaged. Some people say it was analien life form that got into him, others think it was the ghost of adead crewman. I never knew what to believe, but Webb is still outthere, drifting. When the subspace noise is real low, some comm. officers say they can still hear the echo of his distress call. Beep,Beep. Are you sure? Now you know. It must be gusting at eighty kph. Try flying through an ion storm at warp two. What is it? What for? Are we allowed to squash alien life forms? You wanna shoot a bug? Not me, sir. I'll go. Trip? Hello? Was anybody outside just now? There's someone else out there. Near the campsite. It's no story. I'm telling you, I saw three people. It was too dark. There could be something wrong with your scanner. They looked pretty real to me. Ethan! Ethan! That could explain why they're not showing up on our scanners. The Captain's on his way. We're gettingout of here. You okay? Sir. I hate to add to our problems, but we're running low onwater. Sir? You were the one who found these caves, and it was your idea tostay overnight. Commander! There! I'm trying, sir. No. I was hoping it was all just a bad dream."

Is that snow on those mountains? Well, call him. I tried some plomeek broth this morning. It was very good. Vulcan food is interesting. Yes. Thanks for choosing me for this mission. Great. I know. Worth every light year. I assume the Captain went after him. That's it, to the left of that trinary cluster. Our sun. Yeah, positive. Just another speck of light no different thanany other. Are you okay? Wait a minute. You notice something? Fireflies are gone. Maybe it's the ghost of George Webb. What? It's the wind. Nope. What? Three? What did they look like? Ethan? Where are you going? Who were they? Well, who were you talking to? She's lying, Commander. I saw her talking to them. In there. There were two of them. No, I'm not. Why won't you tell us what's going on? What dothey want? Never better. It could be a trap, Commander. What?"
100,ENT,episode 2,ETHAN,"How can you eat that stuff? At least this tastes like something. I thought we were headed for a nebula. There's a lot of plant life. It might be an oxygen atmosphere. Maybe they live underground or in the water. You'd think the Captain would make an announcement or something. Headache. If it's all right with you, I'd like to lie down for awhile before we get back to work. Did you hear that? Someone's out there. There's someone back there. I heard voices. Are you going totell me I'm imagining things too? It's not safe here. Then why are they hiding? Why don't they come out and say hello? We should leave. It's better than being trapped in here.

You think it might be a good idea to drop out of warp? Malcolm, if we ignited the plasma exhaust, what kind of damagewould it do to the nacelles? How much damage? Go to half impulse, Ensign. Put up A4. Record all aft sensors. Fire. Play it back, slowly. Go back and freeze it at theflashpoint. Creep it forward a little. There. Long enough to throw half our systems out of whack. I'm surethey know we've detected them. Open hailing frequencies. This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. Idon't need to tell you where we are. Your presence is disrupting anumber of our systems. Please back away to a distance of at least tenkilometres and respond. We have no intention of harming you, but I wouldn't mind anexplanation. We can't help you unless we can see you, so why don't youdisconnect whatever stealth device you're using. Three hours of decompression in each direction, makes moresense to stay until the job's done. Remember to mind your manners. Archer. Keep your comm. channel open. We'll be right here. Put him through. About five minutes longer than the last time you asked. How's the breathing? They told us the air would clear up duringthe last half hour of decompression. You've only got forty five minutes to go, Trip. Be patient. Hey. Good boy. There you go. Put him through. Yeah, Trip. How's it going? What's the problem? Stand by for a minute. T'Pol, put methrough to Trena'l. My man's not doing so well over there. With all due respect, I've known Commander Tucker for eightyears. He's tough as nails. If he says he's having problems, I've got tobelieve him. You really think that'll make a difference? I told Trena'l you'd try to get atleast an hour of shut-eye. He says that should do the trick. Trena'l says they've dealt with this before. Just onehour. If you're not feeling better, we'll bring you back. Take a nap, Trip. That's an order. Archer out. Sounds like Trip's feeling better. Go ahead, Trip. Just think, yesterday you would have done anything to getout of there. Getting a chance to meet other species is our mission. Hoshi. Trena'l wanted to thank you again. Nice work, Commander. Return to our previous heading, Travis. Trip. Pebbles? Doctor? If we're going to safely remove this life form from CommanderTucker, we'll have to find the Xyrillians. Why don't you andMalcolm see what you can do about locating their ship. Is Trip well enough to return to his duties? You got it. No problem. How you feeling? I haven't said a thing. Doctor? Well, what makes you think she's told anyone? Chicken tetrazzini. Didyou cut yourself? You know, it's been over a week, Trip. We have to startconsidering the possibility that we're not going to find theXyrillians. You know, the Doctor was saying that the gestation period willonly last another five weeks, six at the most. I suggest you stick with the civilian clothes. Seems to helphide the bulge. I'd like you to start seeing the Doctor every eight hours. Asyour delivery date gets closer, he should be able to start figuring outwhat your postnatal responsibilities might be. There's a bright side to all of this. As far as we know, this is the first inter-species pregnancyinvolving a human. Go ahead. On our way. What have you got? Drop down to impulse. Hoshi, try to get an image. Go tighter.Â  Hoshi? If we're going to speak to the Xyrillians, we can't do itwithout the Klingons knowing about it. Open a channel. This is CaptainArcher of the starship Enterprise. We respectfully would like to askfor your assistance with a little problem we're having. Polarize the hull plating. Grabhold of something. So I guess that's their version of a warning shot across ourbows. No, stay where you are. Hail them again. Please accept our apology, but I need to ask you a question. Have you been experiencing any unusual malfunctions? Problemswith your gravity plating, propulsion, environmental controls? We haven't, I promise you. The same things happened to us a fewdays ago. Your problems are being caused by a small stealth vesselthat's been riding in your wake. They're using your plasma exhaust tofuel their warp coils. Wait a minute, wait a minute. They're harmless. We need them,alive. Just give me a chance to explain. Didn't you hear what I said? I need them alive. I assure you that any damage they've done was unintentional. They're simply trying to get home. Sto-Vo? You really don't want to hurt these people. They're actuallyvery kind. They just had some bad luck with their engines. When weconfronted them, they complied with all our requests. If you agree to enter their vessel, I'd appreciate it if youtook my Chief Engineer with you. He was there for three days. They trust him. It'll make thingsa lot easier. There's another reason. Commander Tucker has some unfinishedbusiness with the Xyrillians. There's a pregnancy involved. Show him. I appreciate your co-operation. I hope the next time we meet,we can be of some help to you. Trena'l told me that at full impulse, they can probably gethome in less than a month. That business about the Klingon Chancellor calling me abrother, was that true? Your appetite seems to be back to normal."

Both nacelles are at maximum. They're moving off, sir. Didn't they feed you over there? I heard about the holographic recreation. If we had one of those on board, I can only imagine what it wouldbe used for. Make any friends? Is she the one you thanked for taking care of you? Interesting scales. So, did you get a look at their weapons? Maybe you were allergic to something over there. Nevertheless, you'd better have Doctor Phlox take a look at it. Yes, absolutely certain. Their last trajectory? It may take a while. Why exactly are we trying to find that ship? Commander, if we tune the UV sensors to the omicron band, weshould be able to isolate their plasma trail a good deal faster. Do youthink you could spare a minute just to help me recalibrate them? Got something. If the starship profiles the Vulcans gave us are correct Sir, with all due respect, do we really think this is a wiseidea? Sir, they're charging weapons. And another one.

It's difficult enough having to smell all this. Eating it is outof the question. Water, carbonated. Commander, I think I've found the problem. Something's distorting our wake pattern. Hull plating. Stand by to ignite a charge at eighty metres due aft. They must be using some sort of stealth technology. Their warp reactor is offline. I'll be briefing you on their propulsion systems. They claim to have the ability to synthesize protein andcarbohydrates, but there's no telling what it may taste like. Try to bediplomatic. Commander Tucker's calling again, sir. He's rather anxious. Mister Tucker again, sir. Stand by. Are the injector cells aligned with theprimary coil? Have you tested the ion matrix, Commander? The ion matrix, Commander. I for one won't miss the malfunctions their proximity wascausing. Three days. You were only there for three days and you couldn'trestrain yourself. I imagine that's a question of how you would define gentleman. This engineer wanted you to see her planet? Perhaps the next step would have been to meet her holographicparents. If I'm not mistaken, on some planets that's a precursor tomarriage. One of the first things a diplomat learns is not to stick hisfingers where they don't belong. Yes, sir. We've altered our course to match. We don't, but we've compensated to detect their stealthtelemetry. We should be able to locate them. Yes. I thought you provided all the services they required. Perhaps a little lunch might help. I hear Chef has preparedRigelian sausage. Being vegetarian I can't speak fromexperience, but I'm told it's quite succulent. Coordinates oh seven eight mark six, three million kilometres. Change our heading to intercept. Bridge to Archer. We may have found the Xyrillian ship, sir. We're approaching the coordinates. I've analysed the stealthtelemetry, I believe it's them. They're correct, Lieutenant. That's a Klingon battle cruiser. It appears your repairs didn't last very long. If I'm correct,they're hiding in the Klingon's plasma wake. They're not. If they wanted to destroy Enterprise they wouldhave done it. Less than one month ago, Captain Archer stood in the HighCouncil Chamber in Kronos. The Chancellor himself called him a man ofhonour, a brother. Enterprise is the ship that found Klaang andreturned him to the Empire. Without Klaang, your houses would be at warwith each other. Jonathan Archer is the man who carried out thatrescue. You are in his debt. You would be demonstrating both honour andwisdom to grant his request. Klingons are known to exaggerate. I saw nothing wrong with doingthe same. I've run a check through the Starfleet database. You might bepleased to know that this is the first recorded incident of a humanmale becoming pregnant."
115,ENT,episode 3,TUCKER,"Well, tell him to hurry up. If the relays up there get toocold, they're going to start cutting out on us. Engineering. We'll get to it as soon as we can. We know it's got something to do with the plasma exhaust. Theflow's been restricted for some reason and it's screwing up half thesystems on the ship. Tell Billy to purge the aft manifold. Give me a minute, sir. I think we can figure it out.Â Â TUCKER You're right. The plasma exhaust shouldn't be flaring thatclose to the ship. No, we checked. They're clean. Looks like we've got ourselves a hitchhiker. That still leaves three hours. Can you recommend a good book? Sure you don't want me coming back at night? Three days on an alien ship. Just about ready. I'll just think of it as a blind date. Tucker to Enterprise. Here I go, sir. Don't forget to come back for me. Hello? Hello? This stuff's burning my lungs. How long's it been, sir? A lot easier, but I prefer air I can't see. I feel like I've been in here for a week. Blue one. Green three. Yellow two. Orange five. Yellow three. Red four. Green two. Whoa, whoa, that's too fast. I'm not a computer. Blue three, yellow six, orange four.Â  Not right now, thank you. I think I'd like to take a look at that engine room of yours. I'm sorry, you lost me. I'm having trouble concentrating withall this noise and light. I don't know what I'm certain about. Not good. I don't think I'm going to be much help overhere. I'm having a little more trouble adjusting than I thought Iwould. I feel like I've got a fever. I'm havingtrouble focusing, breathing. I really think I need to get back,Captain. I just want out, sir. I'm not kidding. I can't take much moreof this. It's not going to work, Captain. What's that? I think I'll pass. Not really. It's kind of nice. Does thathappen when you people touch each other? A man needs a lot of fluids when he's under the weather. Could we take some of those with us? Aligned and locked. You're not going to believe this. They've got grass growing on the floor. Real grass. It's even green. IsVulcan grass green? The grass releases some kind of vapour, helps themmetabolize their food. Smells just like a freshly mowed lawn. Oh, right. I've recharged the assembly. Isit up to point four yet? Keep pumping up the gradient. If we can get it up to point fivethe coils should come back online All by themselves. Tucker to Captain Archer. We're nearly ready to bring the warpreactor online. Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours. Tucker out. The depth perception is incredible. What is it, a 3-D simulatorof some kind? Not like any hologram I've ever seen. How do you? The perspective's changing. We're still in the same room and this isn't a boat. Resequenced photons. If we had one of these on Enterprise, I'd never ask for shoreleave. We don't. Well, actually we do, but we do it through observingbehaviour, getting to know someone. Not that I know of. Normally we shave them offwith something called a razor, but I haven't had the chance since I'vebeen here. Go ahead.Â AH'LEN Not in the least.Â Â TUCKER Are there any rules to this game? How the hell did you know that? Your what, favourite food? Dutara root. How'd I know that? This is one hell of a game. You find me attractive. Sometimes. Three hours is three hours. You can't imagine what it was likeover there, Travis. Food growing on the walls, teraphasic warp coils,boxes full of pebbles that make you telepathic. A little shorter than us, weird scales on their faces, butotherwise pretty much like you and me. It sure was something. Remindedme why I signed on. But it is good to be home. I see you've got the visual back online. It was worth every minute. As long as those coils stay charged,you shouldn't have a problem maintaining a stable warp field. Thanks for taking care of me when I wasn't feeling so hot. I appreciate the opportunity, Commander. You should've come with me,Malcolm. It wasn't like any visual simulator I've ever tried. It wasmore like actually being there. You could smell the ocean, feel thesalt air on your skin. I don't know if they can recreate people with it, but it suredid a hell of a job on landscapes. Ah'len, one of their engineers. She's the one who showed me theholographic chamber. Yeah. She did have a certain sensuality to her. I don't even know if they had any. Have you tried thesescrambled eggs? Tastes just like the real thing today. Well, I cleared bioscan. As far as I know, I've never been allergicto anything. What? Doc, I was over there to repair a warp reactor. What are youtalking about? Meaning? I beg your pardon? What the hell are you talking about? What do you mean? That's comforting, but how the hell did I get knocked up? I'm telling you, Captain, I was a complete gentleman the entiretime. The only female I had any contact with was Ah'len, theirengineer. Other than repairing the reactor, all she and I did togetherwas go into that holographic chamber they've got. She showed me somehome movies, simulations of their planet, but I didn't lay a hand onher. There's got to be some way to get this thing out of me withouthurting it. Can't you create a surrogate chamber or something? So? We took a ride in a row boat. I swear, Captain, nothinghappened. I've been in Starfleet for twelve years. Do you think I'djeopardise my career by messing around with some alien engineer on athree day mission? I considered myself a diplomat from the minute I setfoot in that vessel. Well, there was that box of pebbles. Yeah, she had it on the boat. But it was no bid deal. We juststuck our hands into these granules for a few minutes. It's a game theyplay, let's you read each other's minds. They weren't even real, theywere holographic just like everything else in the room. Captain? What, are you kidding? I'm fine. You think we could keep this between the four of us, at leastfor the time being? Dillard. Look at this lift. It's an accident waiting to happen. This safety bar's a metreoff the floor. What use would it be for a small person? A short alien, a child. This thing's a deathtrap.Â Â TUCKER Never mind. Are you certain you made thecorrect sensor modifications? How do we know they haven't changed their heading? If you'll excuse me, I'm not feeling very well. I think I'm just going to go lie down for a while. I'm afraid this isn't a very good time. Captain's starlog, supplemental. We've spent eightdays looking for the Xyrillian ship, but so far we've had no luck. Sorry I'm late. I thought we all promised to keep this under wraps. I knew it. She probably let it slip the minute she leftSickbay. Where I'm from, Vulcans aren't known for keeping promises. All you have to do is see the way they whisper, talk behind myback. You know what happened this morning? Ensign Hart pulled my chairout for me. I'm telling you, it was T'Pol and you can be sure it wasintentional. What's that? I wish. I don't want to ruin you appetites, but take a look atthis. Just how many of these am I going to grow? Andwhile we're on the subject, are they going to go away again afterward? Great. What's that supposed to mean? Are you saying I'm going todeliver this baby? I'm the Chief Engineer. I spent years earning that position. Inever had any intention of becoming a working mother. How much bigger is this thing going to get? I'm already thelaughing stock of the ship. I'd lovesome more of this. Postnatal responsibilities? Yeah? What's that. Thank you. Doesn't look very stealthy to me. Where the hell are the Xyrillians? Why are they attacking us? Sir, look at their starboard nacelle. The power's fluctuatingjust like ours did when the Xyrillians were riding in our wake. I'm the one who repaired their warp reactor, or at least Ithought I did. I spent three days on their ship. They have some amazingtechnology. If you don't kill them, I'm sure they'd share it with you,teach you how to use it. Well for one, they've got some incredible holography. I don'tknow how advanced Klingon holograms are, but these are like nothing Iever saw before. Press a few buttons and you'll be standing on ahillside overlooking Kronos. It's unbelievable. Couldn't hurt to take alook, unless the decompression cycle frightens you. I'm afraid that's not going to be so easy. Captain Vorok has agreed to considerreleasing your ship in exchange for one or two of your holographicsimulators. It would be a good idea to cooperate. It wasn't easy, but we were very motivated. No need to apologise, but I would be real appreciative if youcould get this out of me, assuming it's safe. It's a girl, huh? The only thing worse than spending threehours in a decompression chamber with a bunch of Klingons is doing ittwice in one day. I smelled things in there I hope I never smell again. No more hitch-hiking? Just eating for one again. Just how I always wanted to get into the history books.<Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

Tell me, didyour visit to the Xyrillian ship involve any romance? Were you intimate with anyone? It seems you did a little more than repair work. This is a nipple. Ah, the blastocyst is located between the sixth and seventhintercostals. I'm not quite sure if congratulations are in order, Commander,but you're pregnant. Here,Â do you see that cell cluster? Thatis the embryo.Â I assume you'll be happy to know that it'snot technically your child. When reproducing, the Xyrillians only utilize the geneticmaterial of the mother. The males simply serve as hosts. We don't have any data on their mating procedures, but Iwouldn't think it would be that difficult for you to recollect a sexualencounter. The embryo has integrated with your pericardium. I wouldn't becomfortable extracting it without more information on the gestationprocess. There had to be a somewhat lengthy physical contact to transferthis much genetic material. Without a sample of these telepathic granules it would beimpossible to make a determination, but they could have served as thetransferral medium. You'll probably feel a bit nauseated in the mornings, so getsufficient rest and exercise and see me at least once a day. Thatnipple may not be the only surprise your body has in store for you. Not a word. But Sub-Commander T'Pol promised to keep your pregnancy a secret. One would think. Then again, I have no experience with thisspecies. I believe he's saying a good deal more than that.

You'd better stand up.Â  It was worth every minute. Good luck to you. The reactor worked fine for six days then went offline again. How did you find us? I don't understand. Ihad no idea this could happen with another species. If I'd known. It's still early enough to transfer the embryo toanother host. She looks very healthy."

143,ENT,episode 4,ARCHER,"Are we there yet? You'd be the first. I'll let you know in about three hours and seventeen minutes. I'm surprised you've never heard of it. It was called the Great Experiment. Could humans colonise deepspace? They'd already build New Berlin on the Moon, Utopia Planetia onMars, even a few asteroid colonies, but all within our solar system. When they found an Earth-like planet less than twenty light-years away,it was hard to resist. Nine years there, nine years back, but they made it. People have been trying to answer that question for a longtime. No one's heard from Terra Nova in over seventy years. After thecolony was built, relations with Earth became strained. The SpaceAgency figured nothing succeeds like success, so they decided to sendanother vessel. The colonists protested. They'd been there five years, this wastheir home. They didn't want another two hundred people arriving. Thefolks back on Earth argued that there weren't any other habitableplanets within reach, but the colonists dug their heels in. There werea few angry messages sent back and forth, then one day nobody heardfrom them again. Nine years there, nine years back, it would have been a prettylong trip. Let's see it. Put us in orbit over the colony. Terra Nova colony, this is Captain Jonathan Archer of theStarship Enterprise. We've come from Earth. Please respond. Any biosigns? From what? Let's take a look. Closer. Let's hope the ghosts can give us some answers. How bad is theradiation. Trip, take the Bridge. Travis. Whatever happened, I've got to believe they tried to let Earthknow about it. Good. See if the data buffer's intact. We might be able toaccess their last transmission logs. Walk the perimeter. See what you can find. If that's what killed them, where are the bodies? That would have been difficult. That's a bulkhead. Theydesigned their ship to be disassembled. That's how they built thecolony. It was a one-way trip. We're on our way. You get a look at him? Archer to Mayweather. Get back to the shuttle and grab a pair of flashlights. Make itquick. After you. My name is Archer. We're looking for some people. I was hopingyou could help us. We're not going to hurt you. We'rejust trying to find out what happened to them.Â  Which way? We're under attack, and I think we just took a wrong turn. Wecould use a little help navigating down here. I don't see a tunnel. Malcolm?Â Â ARCHER Go.Â  Take us up. Archer to the Bridge. What have you found? The only one I'm interested in right nowis Lieutenant Reed. We've got to get him out of there. Have you found him? Have Doctor Phlox join us in the Situationroom. If these are the descendants of the original colonists, they'venever seen other humans before. Maybe we look as strange to them asthey did to us. Have you figured out what caused it? They also hunt some kind of burrowing animal. Where's Malcolm? I don't want to risk any more casualties. Despite how theylook, they're still human. We've got to find some way to talk to them. If I can't make first contact with other humans I don't haveany business being out here. Malcolm was shot. Grab your medical kitand meet me at the launch bay. Try to find out what irradiated the surface. You andHoshi get to work on that data buffer. I want to know if they tried tosend any messages to Earth. Hard not to hear a shuttlepod landing on your roof. I'm unarmed. I just want to talk. I'mconcerned about my officer. I'd like to see him.Â  How's the leg? That's right. It's called Enterprise. No. We're here to find out what happened to the colony. We cameto help you. I told you, we're not here to hurt anybody. All right, but he won't be able to get through these tunnels onone leg. My doctor needs to treat him. Whatmakes you think we're here to hurt you? Why do you think that? I don't understand. To the underside. I think I know what you're talking about. Thepoison rain, it was some kind of radiation. I don't know what caused itbut I'm sure it wasn't humans. I know this'll be hard for you to accept, but you're thedescendants of human beings. Your ancestors colonised this planet overseventy years ago. They came from Earth, just like I did. I don't knowwhat happened, but maybe we could work together and find out. If that's your way of calling me a liar, give me a chance toprove what I'm saying. My sky ship has tools that can help us find outwhat happened here. Doctor Phlox can make her well, but she'd have to come back toour ship. She'd be back before the sun rises on the overside. Let us helpyou. He needs to be treated as well. Probably best if you lead the way. That's Enterprise. It's a lot like the ship thatbrought the colonists to this planet. It was called the Conestoga. Maybe you were born on board, or were you born after your parents gothere? It's all right. Medicine. He's just going to give her some medicine. I've got some other pictures you might like to see. One of mycrewmen found these in our database. They might help you remember what it was likeliving on the overside before the poison rain. I'm just trying to help you see how you got here. Well look again. Because whether you want to believe it or not,we're both human. Doctor,keep me posted. Captain's starlog, supplemental. Sub-CommanderT'Pol has discovered the remnants of an impact crater that couldexplain the radiation. How far away is it? Comet or an asteroid? The poison rain. Come in. So, for some reason, the young kids survive and begin livingunderground. Their last memories of their parents are hearing themblame humans for destroying the colony. The idea that humans are theenemy has been embedded in them for more than two generations. Thisisn't going to be easy. Go ahead. Is everything all right? Nice work. Would bringing them to the surface help? How's she doing? Bring them to the Situation room. It's not safe for you anymore. When the asteroid hit, thefallout contained certain poisons. Humans under the age of four or fivecan usually build up an immunity to them. That's why they survived. I went through about two to three hundred photographs before Ifound this. Look familiar, Nadet? And what about the people? What were humans doing in your colony before it was destroyed? I think I can help answer that. You're sure none ofthese people look familiar? From the data we retrieved on thisphotograph, we're pretty sure this woman's name was Vera Fuller. Ring abell? Look closely. VeraFuller. What do you remember? Vera had a daughter named Bernadette. She'd be about seventyfive now in Earth years. Is her treatment finished? Fine. As soon as you're done, bring them to the Launch bay. Sub-Commander. There are fifty eight human beings inthose tunnels and they're all going to die if we don't get them out ofit, and what do they think? They think we're a bunch of hostile alienstrying to take their colony over. What? And then what, put them in chains? What the hell do you think this is, a slave shi? We can'trelocate them by force. We have to convince them that returning to Earth is the rightthing. We can't take them by force. What are you talking about? You're damn straight. They're human beings. It's theirbirthright. It might take a little while, but they'll adapt. It's ahell of a lot better than dying down in those tunnels. Archer to Tucker. Get up here on the double and bring your maps with you. Southern hemisphere? Go ahead, Doc. I'll be there in a couple of minutes. There's got to be similarunderground topography on one of these southern continents. Caves,caverns. Find them. Put that on a for me. And it wouldn't hurt ifthey were crawling with those, what do they call them, diggers. Your planet has three large islands to thesouth. We call them continents. The climate is nearly identical to youroverside. We don't know how similar the underside is, but my people areworking on that now. The important thing is, the poison rain never fellthere. You'd be safe. Your children would be safe. You could even spendtime on the overside if you wanted to. Was that photograph of Vera Fuller and her daughter shale? Doyou really believe we created it to trick you? You're human. So am I. Humans help each other. Would you at least talk to your people, tell them what Iproposed? Fire them up again. We're okay, butgetting out of here is going to be tricky. Can you give us thecoordinatesÂ  I think we're done dropping. How far have we gone? Hold on. Trip, if I open the port hatch, what am I going tofind? You're going to have to build a rig to get this pod back on thesurface. What are you talking about? Stay here with the shuttle. Keep your comm. open.Â VOICE I'll do what I can, but I doubt I can make it down there. I need you to give me my phase pistol. My gun. So I can free this man. It's your turn to trust me.Â Â ARCHER How are you holding up? Tell you what, Travis. Why don't you put together the reportfor Starfleet. If I'm not mistaken, it'll be headline news back home."

I was just getting used to the place. That's an old MK-33, isn't it? Or is it a34? Impressive body armour you're wearing. Did you make it yourself? Right. I don't suppose there's a lavatory on the premises, is there? Iwouldn't mind freshening up a little. No. Didn't think so. That all depends. What's for dinner? Looks a little undercooked. Not bad.

154,ENT,episode 4,T'POL,"Terra Nova? I'm not familiar with the early years of human spaceexploration. Name one. What happened to them? Why didn't you send a vessel to find out what happened? A Vulcan ship could have made the journey in far less time. Whydidn't you ask them? My experience with humans is limited, but I've come to learnthat they're quite resourceful. Terra Nova may still be there, Captain. No, but the colony appears to be intact. I'm also detecting lowlevels of surface radiation. I can't tell. Less than eight hundred millirads. A few hours of exposureshouldn't pose a risk. No sign of weapons fire, only rust. Judging by the isotope decays, the radiation levels seventyyears ago would have been lethal. Maybe they left the planet before it could affect them. This leads to a network of caverns that extend for severalhundred metres. T'Pol to Captain Archer. Captain? Just a moment. In approximately threemetres, a tunnel will branch off to your left. Take it. Correction, ten metres. Those weren't aliens. They're human. They may have been driven underground by the radiation. A section of this tunnel is collapsed. It's empty. If we couldget into it, we could clear the obstruction with phase pistols. We'd beless than twenty metres from Lieutenant Reed. Captain. About five hundred kilometres north. It's been partially filled in by erosion over the years, but I'mreading impact fractures down to nearly two thousand metres. An asteroid. A large one. The tectonic analysis puts the impactat approximately seventy years ago. The geology was comprised primarily of beresium ore. Thethermo-shock would have created a radioactive cloud that probablycovered the northern hemisphere for more than a year. Doctor Phlox just saved your life. Perhaps you should give himthe benefit of the doubt. After all, he's not human. Neither am I. Stun grenades. Commander Tucker's continued to enhance the sensor resolution oftheir tunnels. We could transport stun grenades to specific locations,detonate them, and use both shuttlepods to bring them back to the ship. I'm sure Mister Reed could devise appropriate restraints. The alternative was made quite clear by Doctor Phlox. Are you certain it is the right thing? When you get them back to Earth, what will you do? Send them toschool, teach them to read and write, wear human clothing, eat humanfood, teach them to live on the surface, enjoy the sunshine? They've lived in those tunnels for three generations. You can'tjust pluck them up and bring them to a strange world and hope they'lllearn to conform. You'd be destroying their identity, destroying theNovan culture. Unaffected by the asteroid. Is anyone hurt? Captain? Crater? No."
155,ENT,episode 4,TUCKER,"Really? Every school kid on Earth had to learn about the famousVulcan expeditions. History was never my best subject. It took them what, nine years to get there? My grandfather remembered seeing their first transmissions whenhe was a kid. Asking favours of the Vulcans usually ends up carrying too higha price. Looks like a ghost town. We've got a Pretty good picture of those caverns, andwe've picked up fifty two biosigns so far. All human. Yes, sir. He's about ninety metres below the surface. Aye, sir. Twelve point six kilometres worth oftunnels. Looks like they even dug a few wells. The geology's a littleshaky. Some of these passageways have collapsed. Not yet. Right here, sir. There are two people with him. He's too deep. A stun grenade would solve that problem. How deep? They spent all those years getting here, and for what? Captain. The debris cloud reached to about here,ten or twelve degrees north of the equator. You're down about eight metres. Looks likea couple of the abandoned tunnels gave way. You're on the floor of a stable tunnel. You should beokay. Aye, sir. Did more than that. Those people were a year or two away fromextinction. We didn't just find them, we saved their lives.

This is one of the tools the Captain spoke of. It can tell meall kinds of things about the inside of your body. She has an illnessthat we call lung cancer, but it's easily cured. Not long. A few hours at most. He'll be fine for a few hours. My apologies for any discomfort. Not quite. First we have to determine how far her sickness hasspread. That is you. The inside of you, anyway. This picture will tell me what kind of treatment she'll require. Interstitial tumours. The malignancy has spread to her lymphaticsystem. She'll need a series of cytolitic injections. I'll need a few minutes to synthesise it. Sickbay to Archer. Could you come see me, please. Nadet's cancer has been eliminated. But I found something quite troubling. Both she and her son areshowing signs of microcellular decay in their endocrine systems. Theirunderground water supply has probably become contaminated. I don't haveany medication to treat this, and it's only going to get worse. T'Pol says the soil and foliage is going to remain irradiatedfor at least another decade. She's as disagreeable as she was before I treated her. For the last two or three generations that immunity kept you allalive, but now the poisons have gotten into your water supply.

Ialways thought lost colonies affected boomers more than anyone else. Something about people who choose to live off-world. Two hundred thousand kilometres. I promised my dad I'd see this place someday. A housing unit. We've got the schematics for the communications tower. Aye, sir. Go ahead, sir. Yes, sir. Where's Malcolm? If those aliens killed the colonists, they could kill Malcolmtoo. I don't get it. If they're human, why werethey shooting at us? Can we use the transporter? They didn't seem too eager to talk. It's Captain Mitchell. Mark Logan was the head of the opposition, the ones who wereagainst a second wave of settlers. Supposedly, he threatened to fire atany ship that came into orbit. We don't. We only want to help you, make you healthy. I've got the landing site locked in, Captain. Our thrusters are down.Â  Pod One to Enterprise, we've got an emergency. Ever heard of Judge Crater? Disappeared in the early twentieth century. How about AmeliaEarhart? 1937. Never found a trace of her. A lot of people spent years, decades, trying to figure out whathappened to them, but neither of those mysteries holds a candle toTerra Nova. And we solved it!

As a matter of fact, Mister Tucker and I were looking at thesestar charts. There's a planet a few light years off our currentheading. Well the data indicates there's a remote outpost right here onthe northern hemisphere. I take it this P'Jem is under Vulcan jurisdiction? That sounds interesting. How do you think they'd feel about avisit? It's not every day we get a chance to see an ancient Vulcanmonastery. I'd say a stop-over's too good a chance to pass up. Unlessyou disagree? Good. Archer to helm. Prepare to lay in a course correction. T'Pol will give you thecoordinates. I don't like dropping in on people unannounced. Oh, that's too bad. At least we got to see the place. But? You know, I think the oldest monastery I ever visited was inNgari, Tibet, but it wasn't nearly as big as this place. What's all that mean, anyway? Does it mean I get good luck or something? I guessyou're right. Too bad we didn't bring a camera, huh, Commander? Friends of yours? Somehow I didn't think so. It's where we're from. It's our homeworld. This planet was along our course. We only came to visit thesanctuary. We're not bringing them anything. She's my Science officer. I'll admit I have a Vulcan Science officer and that I came hereout of curiosity. Now, if you don't mind my asking, what are you doinghere? Andorians? From what I'm told there isn't one. I don't know. Believe me, she wasn't my first choice. She was assigned to us by the Vulcan High Command. No. For the last time, we just came to see the temple. That's my ship, Enterprise. They're trying tocontact me. Wait! I've already told you the truth. Whose idea was it to visit this place? These guys are serious. They're going to start killing you people if they don't find whatthey're looking for. I don't think they're buying that. Not this time. Loks likethere are four of them. I saw some kind of scanning console. Theytalked a lot about searching rooms. They answered a hail from Enterprise. They threatened to killus all if anyone attempts a rescue. I didn't recruit my tactical officer to sit on his butt whenhe's threatened. The Andorians smashed our communicators. The longerwe're out of contact the more likely Malcolm will put together alanding party, warning or no warning. It's just a matter of time. So if anyone has a suggestion, I'mall ears. No offence. You said you had no technology. Where is this transmitter? You take it. Do the Andorians have a transporter? That gives us the element of surprise. We could bring anassault team right into the atrium. What about this room? By the time the Andorians detected thetransport we'd be armed and ready. If you've got any better ideas? There's room in here. You're freezing. Come on. I'd say our lives are already at risk. It seems like you're letting them walk all over you. They comein here, they smash your relics, they beat up your people, then youjust sit back and wait for them to walk away? I admire your ethics, but right now a little violence mighthelp. You know, I came here hoping to gain a little insight into theVulcan mind. It looks like I'm getting it. You people think you're sodamned enlightened. Problem? I'dlike to find a peaceful solution too, but I don't think that's going tohappen. However we end up dealing with this, I need to know I can counton you. I just want to know where we stand. Do any ofthese tunnels lead to the outside? What about this reliquary? I need to speak with you alone. I have some information for you. Well, for one thing, I needed some fresh air. You ever beenstuck in a room full of Vulcans for twelve hours? I'll bet their robes haven't been washed since the time ofSurak. Have you heard of him? Vulcan philosopher. He's the one who goteverybody to start purging their emotions. I don't know about you, butI've learned really a lot since I got here. Well, that depends. What do you want to know? All right,information. Did you know that over seventy percent of the organisms onmy homeworld are bacteria. And here's something I think you'll find interesting. There wasa man in Canton, Ohio who once rolled a ball of string over six metresin diameter. There was a famous astronomer on Earth. Tycho Brahe. He lost his nose ina duel over a math equation. Please, please, I can't stand anotherminute with the Vulcans. Please. A light at the end of the tunnel. You know what to do,Commander. No, you don't have to tell me. Just try and stay out of the wayand everything will work out fine. Leave her alone. Where are the phase pistols? If he wakes up, stun him again. Let's go. We'll do our best not to look at anything. What would you suggest we do? You ever use one of those? I didn't think so. The Andorianshave seen your sacred relics. A couple of humans won't make much of adifference. Hold your fire. You might want to take a look at this. I don't believe this. Does that thing have imagingsensors? Take all the pictures you can. Very disrespectful. Boy, did it feel good. All this timethey've been calling these monks liars, and all this time they've beenright. Give it to him. Give it to him. You've gotwhat you came for. Now get out of here. The Vulcans violated your treaty. Your people ought to knowabout it. You have a problem with that? Thanks for the tour. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

A vessel, not Vulcan, and it's less than one kilometre from ourshuttlepod. Well, I for one would like to know who these visitors are. Andwhy havenn't we heard from the landing party? Maybe that should be standard procedure as well. Yes. I'm looking for Captain Archer. Let me talk to the Captain. Try T'Pol or Commander Tucker. Have the launch bay put shuttlepod two on standby. I don't take orders from a comm. voice, Ensign. Not unless thatvoice belongs to the Captain. Take a look at the Vulcan database. Seeif it has anything on these Andorians. What is it? Put it through. This is Enterprise. We can barely read you, Commander. What's your status? Andorians, yes. I've been reading about them in the Vulcandatabase. Militaristic. Blue skinned. Well, what do they want? Are you certain we can't negotiate? Understood. Phase pistols on stun. The Captain's instructions were quite explicit. It's a console,Ensign. It won't bite. Crewman? I've heard the same stories. Now get up here. Coordinates set? Then energise before we change our minds. This is it. Will you be all right? This way. Two of them got away. They went down into the catacombs. Here, sir. Captain. Violence in a sanctuary, Captain? They've got enough equipment down there to see what any Andorianis having for breakfast."

201,ENT,episode 5,T'POL,"You wanted to see me, Captain. I'm familiar with it. P'Jem. It's an ancient spiritual retreat. A remote sanctuary forKolinahr and peaceful meditation. The Vulcan purging of emotion. P'Jem is a place of quiet contemplation, Captain. I'm notcertain we'd be welcome. I'll research the proper protocols. It was the Captain's idea. It is a Vulcan sanctuary, if that's what you mean. It could create a certain awkwardness. In infinite combinations. Our mission is to make contact with those whom humans considernew life and new civilisations. I suppose so. It wasn't possible to hail them. The monks consider technology adistraction from their spiritual pursuits. It won't be a problem as long as we observe the properprotocols. When we arrive, we'll be greeted by a Vulcan Elder. Youshould not speak to him or any member of the order unless spoken tofirst. If they appear to be meditating, do not approach them or attemptto make conversation. Also, maintain quiet at all times and do nottouch or disturb any artefacts, relics or ornamentation. If we arriveat their time of communal kolinahr it's likely we'll be turned away. Atthe conclusion of our visit we'll be offered the Stone of J'Kah as agesture of salutation. Accept it, then bow slightly and observe arespectful silence for approximately five seconds. The temple is almost three thousand years old, Commander. Youcan't expect it to be in pristine condition. He says we have arrived at the time of kolinahr. The order mustremain in silent reflection throughout the lunar cycle. They are not tobe disturbed. Your service honours us. Before we leave, may Irequest the offering of the J'Kah stone for my distinguished guests. It's probably nothing. This is the main atrium. There should be more than one member ofthe order present, and the icon in that shrine is perched at an oddangle. That's not all, Captain. The Vulcan Elder seems agitated. I've heard it can take days to explore this site. They're Andorians, Captain. They're known for their suspiciousand volatile nature. Yes, sir. They resent our superior reasoning and our technology. They evenbelieve that we intend to mount an invasion on their homeworld. Nine weeks and four days. You get used to it, and I was given a nasal numbing agent. Mister Reed wouldn't be that reckless. You need it more than I do. No. The sound of the transporter alone would alert the guards. They'd start firing before the team was fully resequenced. For what? A fire fight in close quarters with a dozen monks atrisk? I'm fine. It's been twenty four hours since I took my nasal numbing agent. The cold is preferable to the odour. An armed assault would put all of our lives at risk, not tomention the destruction of the sanctuary itself. Tensions between Andoria and Vulcan are high. Any casualtieswould only make matters worse. We don't believe in responding to violence with violence. You're beginning to sound like an Andorian. Are you questioning my loyalty? I have never disobeyed your orders. That would almost be directly beneath the atrium. Perhaps you have faulty equipment. They're down this passage. Thirty metres. Yes. I've completed my scans. Sir? Your communicator. T'Pol to Enterprise. The Andorian ship will be leaving the surface momentarily. They're free to go."
202,ENT,episode 5,TUCKER,"Maybe it's just me, but it seems likethese Vulcan star charts take all the fun out of it. We're supposed tobe explorers, aren't we? Where's the exploration in going places people have alreadybeen? Yeah. Are you saying those Vulcan star charts aren't all thataccurate? If that's true, good luck getting them to admit it. Kolinahr? It's because Vulcans think we smell bad, isn't it? They don't even know we're coming? I thought Starfleet training was tough. You say this is a place to purge emotions? Looks like somebody had to purge pretty bad. He bashed the door in. Oddly perched, huh. We'd better call Starfleet Command. You call that agitated? It'd take at least that long to cleanthe place up. You're thinking of the Blarney Stone, Captain, or when you patthe Buddha's belly. You ever been to San Francisco Zoo? Now there's something youshould see. Okay, okay. Don't get your antennas in a twist. Hey! He's telling the truth. We came for a visit, that's all. Now these guys are agitated. What do they want with a three thousand year old temple? So what are you going to do, just sit here and let them ransackthe place? No good deed goes unpunished. You'd think they could find whatever it is they're looking forwith those antennas of theirs. Knowing him, a heavily armed landing party. I never met a busted radio I couldn't fix. Catacombs. For people without emotion, you sure have a flair for thedramatic. Fellas. What'sdown there? Looks like a krellide power cell. No thanks. It'll just get in my way. Enterprise, this is Commander Tucker. Repeat, Enterprise,this is Commander Tucker. Guess you heard we kind of walked into a hostage situation. Thewhole place has been taken over by Andorians. That's them. They seem to think this place is some kind of a spy station. They're looking for a sensor array. The Captain says to sit tight. He doesn't want to provoke them any morethan we already have. He also said to tell you we're working on a wayout of here. The Captain came back from his lastnegotiation with a face full of bruises. We'll be in touch. I saw an old stairwell down there, maybe a metre wide. It wasright about here. There were three dim lights coming from the top. It lookedsomething like this. Hey! Can you hear me? Hello? Anybody out there? Yes, sir. Something sure smells."

I confess I feel awkward on this shipmyself, sometimes, out of place. But what is that Vulcan motto? Infinite diversity. And what is diversity but a celebration of differences. I wonderif you might remind me about our mission on this vessel. Please,indulge me. In other words, to seek infinite diversity. Well then, it seems to me a cultural exchange between yourVulcan brethren and your human crew is simply a furtherance of thatmission."

Are you a supply ship bringing themmore surveillance equipment? So you admit you're working with the Vulcans. We scanned your ship in orbit. You're very well armed for peoplewho came for a visit. You and the pink skins have proven what wealready knew. This is far more than a sanctuary. Where's the sensor array? Where is it! You humans obviously have emotions. I find it curious that you'dselect a Vulcan as your science officer. Why a Vulcan? Why a Vulcan? You take orders from the High Command? Enterprise. He's a prisoner of the Andorian Imperial Guard. We knowyou're in collaboration with the Vulcans. Your ship Is under constant surveillance. Arm yourweapons or make any attempt to approach the surface and I'll kill thehostages. Have you checked the living quarters? Is that something you could live with, Captain? Are you losing faith in our mission? The Vulcans are very deceptive. It's here, I'm sure of it. If weback down now, everything we've fought for is meaningless. If nothingelse, remember that, Keval. What is it. The information. What did you come to tell us? You must enjoy pain. What is it? We detected an energy surge. It came from this chamber. Or perhaps you have equipment we don't know about. Watch them. Where are they? Where! Try boosting the proximity sensors. Find them. Keval! How do we know you won't attack our vessel. We're in your debt."
236,ENT,episode 5,KEVAL,"Stop looking at me. We've searched all the chambers in theeastern tower. Not yet. How many times do we have to search thesame rooms? We've looked everywhere, we've run a thousand scans. Some kind of energy fluctuation. This can't be right. I'm detecting three new biosigns, allhuman. They're within twenty metres. I can't pinpoint the signal. They're very close."
237,ENT,episode 5,ELDER,"Please wait. Â ARCHER Forgive the disarray. Kolinahr encourages the members of ourorder to face their vestigial emotions. The repercussions can sometimesbe violent. Please. This is the stone of J'Kah, which represents thefoundation of all we believe. A life of order and control throughlogic. Ishte acula bestalma itok,J'Kah. It is a traditional litany, passed down for generations. Please, you must leave now. It's an Earth vessel. I didn't know. In order to alleviate tensions, we negotiated a treaty, but someAndorian factions still believe we're bent on conquest. They believe we are hiding a long range sensor array. This is aplace of introspection, Captain. There are no spies her, and notechnology. The Andorians were here twice before and both times left withina day. Unfortunately your arrival has amplified their suspicions. How long have you lived on the Earth ship? The smell must be intolerable. There is nothing to find. There is an option. A transmitter. It's very old. It hasn't been used in many years. It may not even be working. Please listen to me, Captain. There are hidden passages beneathus where we keep our most sacred relics, our honoured dead. If theAndorians discover them they will damage our culture in ways you can'tbegin to understand. There is one to spare. It's only going to get colder. No. To do so would be blasphemy. I don't have to tell you, Captain. We don't condone theseactions you are about to take. I hope you're pleased, Captain. You've turned a place ofsolitude into a war zone. Violence is no longer our way."
238,ENT,episode 5,VULCAN,"Our two species are from neighbouring systems. We've been inconflict for many years. Typically, they make a great display of their indignance. Whenthey find nothing, they leave. You've endangered us all. In the catacombs. Master Haadok, one of the founders of P'Jem. The transmitter isthis way. The reliquary. Our most sacred artefacts are kept there. Thisis the transmitter. No one's entered it in years. I'm going with you. We must protect what is ours. It leads to the reliquary. Only members of the high order areallowed to go inside. I can't permit it, Captain. I'll disarm them myself. Place your weapons on the ground. Iwill kill him if necessary. Give that to me."
239,ENT,episode 5,THOLOS,"What does that mean, Earth? What is that? You brought her. I'll enjoy having you, as a prisoner. Perhaps if we decapitate one or two of those monks he'll starttelling us the truth. What? He's wasting our time. Take him back. Most Vulcans smell of dust, butyou're different. Did you say something, pink skin? I've heard about your matingrituals. That Vulcan women force their men to fight each other to thedeath. Would you like me to kill someone for you? Would you like me to kill him?"

Take us closer, Ensign. Ever seen anything like that in your astronomy books? I always wanted to chase a comet. Maybe we should spend a fewdays following this one. Except this one's bigger than any comet humans have ever seen. That's got to be worth a look. Stay with it, Travis. Eisilium? I've never heard of eisilium. This could be your chance. Can we collect a sample with thetransporter? How long would you need? You up for a little comet walk? Get started. Hail them. This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the StarshipEnterprise. Pleased to meet you. Not at all. Just taking a look at this comet. Really? My science officer tells me that Vulcans that Vulcansaren't very interested in comets. We plan to send a drilling team to the surface to collect coresamples. You're welcome to participate. Stay as long as you want. T'Pol. I'd love to know what they're really doinghere. You don't find anything strange about them suddenly showing up? Curious? That doesn't sound very Vulcan to me. This isn't thefirst time we've caught them lurking around. Remember three weeks ago,the planetary nebula? So why didn't they respond to our hails? Why'd they go to warpwhen we headed toward them? I'm starting to get the feeling they'relooking over our shoulder a little too often. We'll see. Fine. If Vanik is the kind of guy who likes towatch, let him. You're sure this was sent to her quarters. Not a word. We had an agreement. She promised not to speak tothe Vulcans without telling me. Tell her it's top priority. Stay put, Commander. This is important. Start the recording. Tothe students of Miz Malvin's fourth grade class at the Worley ElementarySchool in Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland. This is Captain Archer aboardthe starship Enterprise. On behalf of the entire crew, I'd like tothank you for your transmission. We all got a real kick out of yourdrawings and letters. You asked a lot of interesting questions. I wishwe had time to answer all of them, but if we did that, we wouldn't getmuch exploring done. So I've selected a few, and hopefully our answerswill give you a better idea of what life is like out here. Liam Brennanasks 'what do you eat?' For the most part, the same things you eat athome. Our Chef can make anything from a peanut butter and jellysandwich to turkey with all the trimmings. We have a hydroponicgreenhouse onboard where we grow fruits and vegetables, and we can alsoreplicate certain foods with our protein resequencer. Here's one fromGeoff Miles. 'Is dating allowed on Enterprise?' Well, it's notdiscouraged, but there isn't a lot of privacy on a starship. Most ofour crew share quarters with at least one other person, so it wouldn'texactly be practical. But if two crewmembers decide that they reallylike each other, there are a lot of places they can go to look at thestars. Chloe O'Shannon wants to know, 'how do we talk to aliens?' Ithink I'll give that one to my Communications Officer, Ensign HoshiSato. Thanks, Hoshi. Here's one from Molly McCook. 'When you flushthe toilet, where does it go?' That sounds like an engineeringquestion, so we'll ask Commander Charles Tucker, our Chief Engineer. Trip. It's a perfectly valid question. You're doing fine. Very enlightening, Commander. Gabrielle Witty wants to know ifgerms can live in space. Thank you, Doctor. Fascinating. I think we've taken up enoughof Miz Malvin's classroom time. By the way, we've included some picturesof a comet we're studying. We think it might be the biggest one everdiscovered by humans or Vulcans. That's what's so exciting about beingon Enterprise. You never know what you're going to find next. We missEarth, but hearing from you makes us all feel a little closer to home. Captain Archer, out. How'd it go? Archer to Lieutenant Reed. How are you doing, Malcolm? I'm sure I don't need to remind you we'rebeing observed. We want this to go as smoothly as possible. Make a good impression. So tell me, Who's the sculptor? Archer out. Come in. And? What did it say? What do you mean? Why the hell was it encrypted? Let it go, Trip. Come on, it was an honest mistake. How's that going to help? You're a good man. You might want to take a phase pistol withyou. Archer to T'Pol. Please report to my Ready room. I thought I'd invite Captain Vanik for avisit. If he's so interested in how we do things, he might as well comesee for himself. Once he realises we're not going to blow up thegalaxy, maybe he'll leave us alone. Dinner's a good way to break the ice. I was hoping you mightgive Chef some menu suggestions. A little food, a little wine. You know what I mean. Just help me make him go away. Go ahead. Stand by. Inform the Vulcans we're aboutto make a very loud noise. Archer to Reed. Blast away. If I'm not mistaken, you're flying a Surakclass ship. You can get her up to, what, six, six point five? A few years back I was a guest aboard a Maymora class ship, theYarahla. Captain Tok. Do you know him? Oh. We made a run to a dark matter nebula. I helped set up thegraviton telescope. Most fun I've ever had on a space walk. ThoseVulcan EV suits are something else, like you're flying around insideyour own little starship. Something wrong with your Pok Tar? If it's not to your liking, I'm sure our Chef can prepare yousomething else. After dinner, I thought you might like to take a look around. Enterprise may not be Surak class, but she's quite a ship. Tea? You know, for people who claim not to be explorers, you sure doget around. On the contrary, it's nice to know no matter how big theuniverse is, there's always a Vulcan ship nearby. We have this peculiar habit of actually talking during meals. We'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. Well, where did the time go? Seems like you just got here. I'msure you're eager to get back to your ship so I'll trouble you withjust one last question. How long to you plan on spying on us? Please show Captain Vanikto the launch bay. Archer to Lieutenant Reed. How's it going? You may want to pick up the pace a little bit. The comet's rotational axis shifted when you set off thosecharges. In about two hours the shuttlepod will be facing the star. The temperature's going to shoot up by acouple of hundred degrees. I want you out of there before then. Be sure you are. Archer out. You two okay? About eighteen metres. We'll get you outof there. Just give us a few minutes. Bring the grappler online. I'll get you in close enough. Do you see them? Take a message, I'm busy. Tell him we've got everything under control. One'll be fine. Reel them in. Ease them back down. Let's try it again. Then we'd better hurry. I'd rather leave him out of this. Reset the grappler. We can do this on our own. I thought you might want to take a look atthe data we collected. You helped us bring it back, it's the least wecan do. You've done more than enough. See you around. Go right ahead. What was that all about?"

253,ENT,episode 6,T'POL,"This rendering is crude, yet surprisingly accurate. We're dropping out of warp. The diameter is eighty two point six kilometres. Vulcan and human scientists have researched hundreds of comets. They've proven to be little more than rock and ice. I came for a tea. Caffeine has little effect on Vulcan physiology. Green tea, hot. I'm very tired. No thank you. It's mostly sugar. I'm fine, Commander. Goodnight. It's an extremely rare mineral. This comet appears to containlarge quantities of it. Vulcan chemists have only obtained small amounts. They've neverbeen able to study it in detail. Most of the eisilium deposits are at least twenty metres beneaththe crust. I'd advise setting down near one of the two poles. If you're outof direct sunlight, the surface ice will be more stable. The starship Ti'Mur. Perhaps they're simply curious. That was nothing more than a survey ship. That seems unlikely. Excuse us, crewman. No. Your point, Commander? It was a personal matter. That takes time. The letter was important. You read my letter? I have more letters in my quarters. Would you like to read thoseas well? Yes, Captain. Has anyone else read the letter? I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention it. I'm sure he'll appreciate the gesture. Certainly. Vulcans don't drink wine. Two days ago. I haven't slept. No. Thank you, Doctor. On Earth, it's customary to exchange personal information withsomeone you've just met. I believe this is Captain Vanik's first visit aboard an Earthvessel. Come in. Please, sit down. I was given permission from the Captain. They're for meditation. Doctor Phlox believes that it might help if I was to discuss myproblem with someone I felt comfortable confiding in. You were far from my first choice, but speaking with someoneelse would mean more people knowing about my situation. You read the letter. Then you know that unless I leave Enterprise immediately, mywedding plans will be cancelled. Koss. We haven't spoken in many years. Marriages on Vulcan arearranged during childhood. I've only met Koss four times. It's assumed that we'd eventually develop an affection for oneanother. His parents planned the union. It's their decision. Are you going to give me advice or criticize my people'stradition. The ceremony was supposed to take place next week. When Idecided to remain on Enterprise I requested a postponement. Koss'sparents were insulted that I would put off our plans to serve on ahuman vessel. It's customary for a husband and wife to reside together for atleast one Vulcan year. He's an architect. It would be illogical for him to live aboarda starship. Your advice, Commander. That is irrelevant. I have an obligation. If you'd spent the last year on Vulcan, you would have learnedthat our commitment to tradition outweighs personal choice. Vulcan's don't. My obligation is to my culture, my heritage. It has to takeprecedence. It was a mistake. I apologise. That would imply that my subconscious mind controls mydecisions. It doesn't. They've fallen another nine metres. Captain, they're moving out of the sunlight. The surface ice isrecrystallising. There is another option. Captain Vanik. His ship has a tractor beam that won't be affected by theeisilium. Vanik offered to assist us. There's no shame in accepting. Vanik expects you to refuse his offer. He sees humans asarrogant, prideful. Why not prove him wrong? You can save them, or youcan let your pride stand in the way. You're human. You're free tochoose. Captain, with your permission, I'd like to transmit a message tothe Ti'Mur, to send to Vulcan. Thank you."
254,ENT,episode 6,TUCKER,"Looks likewe're going about warp four point five. These were sent by my nephew's fourth grade class. I thoughtthe crew might like to see how excited folks at home are about ourmission. Some of these kids are pretty talented. Which one do you want? This one's nice. Or maybe you want First Contact. Or how about thisone? Wow, that's one big snowball. Milk, cold. Catching up on your reading? Stay away from the Zariphean blend unless you want to stay upfor the next three days. You want to join me? I could use the company. Tell me about it. I put out about a hundred fires inEngineering this afternoon and missed dinner. Then somebody told meChef made a pecan pie, and suddenly my life brightened. It's been myfavourite since I was a kid. Care for a bite? It's delicious. What, Vulcans don't have a sweet tooth? It may not be good forthe body, but it sure is good for the soul. Mmm, I feel better already. Must be a real page turner. You all right? Sweet dreams. That's too deep to get a lock. Take a look at something, will you? I've been runningdiagnostics and I found some kind of power surge in the transceiverarray. Who was it sent to? I wish I wasn't. Did she say anything to you about it? Looks like she's having some trouble keeping her promises. Should I have Hoshi decrypt it? You sure you want me here for this? I'vegot a lot of work to do. Pause it, will you? A poop question, sir? Can't Italk about the warp reactor or the transporter? The first thing you've got to understand is we recycle prettymuch everything on a starship. That includes waste, and the first thingthat happens to the waste is it gets processed through a machine calleda bio-matter resequencer. Then it gets broken down into. Hold on. They're going to think I'm the sanitationengineer. So the waste is broken down into littlemolecules and then they get transformed into any number of things wecan use on the ship. Cargo containers, insulation, boots, you name it. Any luck? What's it say? You didn't read it? Thanks. Well, we decrypted the message. It's not exactly what we expected. It's a letter. It's personal. Very personal. You could order me to tell you, sir, but youwouldn't be happy if I did. That's what I want to know. Maybe Vulcans encrypt all theirpersonal letters. All they had to do was send it through regularchannels, mark it personal, and we'd have left it alone. But no, theyhad to encrypt it, force me to start snooping. I feel like I got caughtwith my hand in the cookie jar. I can't let it go. I've got to tell her. It's the right thing to do. At least I'll be able to look herin the eye without feeling guilty. I might need one. Got a minute? In private? Did you ever, did you ever do anything totally by mistake thatyou weren't very proud of? Did you ever come across something that you thought was onething so you reacted in a certain way, but then it turned out to besomething completely different? I found out about your message from the Vulcan ship. Why wasn't it sent through normal Starfleet channels? So they sent it in code? Do you have any idea how suspiciousthat looked? Believe me, I don't feel very good about it. I'm trying to apologise here. No. I won't, I promise. I'd love to get a look inside those nacelles. Hope you saved room for dessert. So, Captain, tell us about yourself. I don't know. Where were you born, how long have you beenCaptain, any hobbies? What'd he say? You decide to tell me what Vanik said? I've never seen your quarters before. Cozy. Youknow you're not supposed to have an open flame on the ship. So, what can I do for you? You want to talk to me? Well, I'm not sure I'm going to be muchhelp. I mean, I've only been in three relationships and they all wentbust. Are you sure you wouldn't rather talk to Hoshi or Ensign Kimball? She's married. I'll do anything I can. What's your problem? Yes. Have you talked to? Have you talked to Koss about all this? How can you be in love with a guy you've only met four times? So his parents send you an ultimatum? He doesn't have a say? Boy. Where I come from, arranged marriages went out withslavery. I'm still a little fuzzy on why they threatened to call it offin the first place. Well, Vanik can take you home. Why don't you go marry Koss,then come back? Maybe he can come to Enterprise. This whole thing sounds illogical. What do you want to do? No, it's not. It's very relevant. Do you want to go back andmarry this guy, spend a year with him, ten years, a hundred years, ordo you want to stay on Enterprise? You've got an obligation to yourself. You've spent the lastyear around humans. If there's one thing you should have learned it'sthat we're free to make our own decisions. There's a lot to be said forpersonal choice. I respect your customs, but this marriage was arranged when youwere a kid. A lot's happened since then. People change. Really. Sounds to me like you already made up your mind. Why the helldid you ask me here? Did it ever occur to you that you might havepostponed the wedding because subconsciously you wanted to get out ofit? Well it happens to humans all the time. Maybe you're picking upsome of our bad habits. The mouth of that chasm's a little narrow. Bring us in another fifty metres. Two metres starboard. Alittle more. There, right there. Synchronise to the rotation. Almost got it. One hit, one miss. The pod's hit an outcropping. It's wedged in. Take us a fewmetres to port. We might be able to pull them around it. Those eisiliumdeposits are disrupting the maglock. I'm losing them. In less than an hour that chasm will be sealed up again. I don't like him any more than you do, Captain, but a tractorbeam sounds like a pretty good idea right now. That tractor beam of yours is quite something. Any chance wecould take a look at the specifications? I thought it might be. You don't have much time. I assume you're all packed. It's personal. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Ah, I believe I can answer that, Captain. Hello, children. I'm Doctor Phlox, the ship's physician. I'm from asystem called Denobula Triaxa and I feel very honoured to be part ofthis important mission. Germs. They may be tiny but they are among themost resilient organisms known to medical science. They can survivealmost anywhere, on your kitchen counter, under your fingernail, in thevacuum of space. Over two hundred million space-dwelling microbes havebeen catalogued. One of the most virulent species lives inside grainsof interstellar dust. Polycocyx astris. They can drift in a dormantstate for millions of years and still cause a nasty cold. I oncediscovered a peculiar colony of spores on the hull of a When did these symptoms begin? Perhaps you slept in an awkward position. For two days? Something on your mind?

It came from the Vulcanship. Whenever you're ready, Captain. Well, Chloe, that's a very good question. We use a device calledthe universal translator. It's like an alien dictionary with hundredsof languages programmed into it, and it can learn new languages veryquickly, but it doesn't always work, and when that happens it's up tome to try to translate. I'm sure I don't have to tell you it can bereally hard sometimes. One wrong word can mean the difference betweensaying 'take my hand' or 'take my life'. So far I have managed to dopretty well. Sorry it took so long. The code was pretty complex. It's in Vulcan. You'll have to run it through the translationmatrix. I didn't feel it'd be right. Aye, sir.

Put us into orbit at five hundredkilometres. Let's hold off a second. We don't know whether they're usinghigh-band frequencies or smoke signals. Let's take a closer look. Doyou see that, just off the coast. It's almost like travelling back in time. Give me a tighter view of the city, Hoshi. Can you get tight enough to see their faces? Freeze that. Theydon't look so different. What do you think, Trip? Not if we look like them. Starfleet could've sent a probe outhere to make maps and take pictures, but they didn't. They sent us sowe could explore with our own senses. You okay? Well, let's hear some of it. A farm? This must be why aliens are always landing in cornfields. So,who do we send first? If the translator goes down, you'll be able to handle yourselfbetter than any of us. We don't need it to be too perfect. Go ahead. Is there a problem? What's causing it? Or maybe we're not the first visitors. What aboutnon-indigenous biosigns? Trip, T'Pol, let's head down to Sickbay. Let thequartermaster know we'll need three more sets of clothing. What's this? Over here. Looks like some kind of curio shop. I guess we'll have to wait until morning. Except we're on the wrong side of this door. Seventy eight light years to get here, our first act isbreaking and entering. Trip. Archer to T'Pol. I think we found what we're looking for. Can you disable it? You don't need to point that weapon at us. We're collectors. We're picking up an antique. Deliveries? Was that necessary? Let's try not to shoot anyone else while we're here, okay? The reactor signature's coming from the other side of thatdoor, but it's protected by some kind of energy field. Hoshi. I'll meet you back at the shuttle. Nothing. You just collapsed. Garos? I'm not working for anyone. I just wanted to make sure you gothome all right. There's something strange going on in that shop. I don't knowwhat, exactly, but I'm trying to figure it out. I'm an investigatorfrom another city. I can't tell you anymore than that, not right now. My colleague's waiting for me. I've got to go. You saidsomething about a sickness. I wanted to come back tomorrow and talk toyou about it. Will you be here? Jon. What about the shop itself, can you scan underneath it? Keep you sensors locked on that shop. If you notice anythingelse out of the ordinary, let me know right away. That woman, Riann, said something about people getting sick. We noticed antiques in the window. My friend here is an amateurcollector. No, and neither are you. Your doesn't match any otherlifeform on this planet. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We'reexplorers from the planet Earth. Now that you know who we are, maybe you could tell us whatyou're doing here. If you enjoy the simple life so much, why do you have anantimatter reactor in your basement? I don't know if you've heard, but there's an illness spreadingthrough this area. Some people seem to think you're the cause of it. You know her? If you wouldn't mind, we'd like to take a look at this reactorof yours. His reactor's got an awful lot of powerfor a fabrication device. Archer to T'Pol. Hello again. Her name's T'Pol. She's helping me investigate Garos's shop. You two have something in common. T'Pol is a scientist as well. Not exactly. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be evasive. I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about thisillness. We were trying to get into the basement. We think there's somekind of machine there, something he's not supposed to have. We're not sure, but it may be indirectly connected to thisepidemic. If you can tell us what you know, we might be able to help. I'm sorry. Why do you believe this Garos is involved? You said something about evening deliveries. That's why you were watching his shop. You thought we werethere for the crates. I'd love a cup. Did youget what you need? All right, you and the others head back. I'll stay here, see if I can earn more about Garos and theseshipments. These people are suffering from something a lot worse thancultural contamination. We've got to find out what it is. Did you say something? I have a similar one. I talk to my dog. What was that? Are you all right? Someone was walking this way, but he turned and went around thecorner. I thought if we pretended to be I want you to head back. Move! Actually, I have. Stay here. It's all right. He's not dead. To meet you. Not you personally, but your people. If you take away our technology we're not that different. Come on. They're mining some kind of veridiumisotope. I'm not surprised. Their drill bits are saturated with it. We've got to shut this all down. The reactor seems to be powering theentire operation but I can't use my phase-pistol. I'd risk blowing uphalf the city. I doubt that we have that much time. Ourbest shot is the transporter. I'll see what I can do about disengagingthat dampening field. Give me a few minutes. I don't suppose you read Malurian. It wasn't designed for that. There's an energy field surrounding the shop. It's keeping myship from seeing what's in here. One of these controls should turn itoff. If the blue line represents the dampening field, this bluebutton should control it. What about them? The blue one's lit. We could debate this all day. Blue or yellow? I told you. We detected your reactor from orbit. We're trying to help these people. What you're doing here iscontaminating their water supply. She belongs here. If anyone walks througheither of these doors, aim this and pull the trigger. How's it going up there? And the reactor? Don't worry about me, just get thereactor. What about it? Archer.Â T'POL No. They're about to leave, but first they need to pick upthree passengers. Archer out. I don't think you're going to have timeto pack up your shop. Captain's starlog, July 31st, 2151. We've removedthe mining equipment from under the shop. As far as we can tell, noneof the Akaali knows what really happened, with one exception. {Riann's attic] Tell themto take the entire dose. That's all they'll need. I've notified T'Pol's people. They're going to look in on youfrom time to time. You bet. It's probably best if you keep all this to yourself. There are lots of inhabited planets to see, but I doubt manywill be this memorable. I'm sorry? I don't understand a word you're saying. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

The latter's more likely. I'm not detecting any EMtransmissions. I'd advise against that. It's standard protocol to wait until asociety develops warp drive before initiating first contact. Starfleet would be wise to adopt them. There's no way to knowhow our arrival would affect the evolution of their society. Our sensors can gather a great deal of data from orbit. You'd be recognised immediately as outsiders. It's remote and sparsely populated. If you're exposed, there's areduced risk of cultural contamination. T'Pol to Archer. Please report to the Bridge. I'm detecting neutrino emissions from a city on the easterncontinent. Possibly an antimatter reactor. I'm not reading any, but at this range it's hard to be certain. Go ahead, Captain. Acknowledged. We'll meet at your coordinates. She was armed. I'll try. We should go. It'll be dawn soon. I'd advise against that. If I'm not mistake, the fear of alienabduction caused a great deal of apprehension on your planet forcenturies. Perhaps we should talk to the shopkeeper first. Yes. Your facility's impressive. Would you mind? Jon, may I speak with you? I should return to the ship and begin my analysis. What about you? The longer you remain, the more you risk cultural contamination. Enjoy your tea. Yes. I'm not familiar with it. Could this be responsible for the epidemic? I'll notify the Captain. Veridium is primarily used to manufacture explosives. Did you find any traces of tetracyanate? Understood. From where? The Captain? On screen. I want to speak with Captain Archer. Prepare to leave orbit on my order. I don't have to reiterate that I outrank you, Mister Tucker. Ensign. I didn't say leave orbit, I said prepare to leave orbit. I haveno intention of abandoning the Captain, dead or alive. Evasive manoeuvres. Keep us within transporter range. Return fire. Put him through. A Malurian vessel's opened fire. We'retaking damage. We're trying to get a lock on it now. Are you all right? He said you'd beenkilled. Commander Tucker, status. How long? If they want it so badly, maybe we should give it to them. Fire. Come about, Ensign. Target their weapons array."
307,ENT,episode 7,TUCKER,"How about that, three stone-cold stars. Pretty exciting, huh? There is one other thing that might be worth swinging by totake a look. A Minshara class planet about four and a half light yearsaway. Only about five hundred million. If our scans are right, itlooks like there's a whole civilisation down there. Pre-industrial? Looks like an old clipper ship. I cannot wait to get down there. Those are Vulcan protocols, not human. So what are you suggesting we do? I think you're right, Captain. These people don't even have indoor plumbing. My feet would be a lot happier in my own boots. T'Pol. I've got it too. The reactor's about eight metres under thisbuilding. There could be a lot more people around then. It might beeasier to get a look at this thing tonight. Not for long. Maybe you don't have to mention this part in your log? Going as fast as I can. Back here. The neutrino emissions are off the meter. It's got to bethrough here. It's some kind of magnetic barrier. I'll try. Nothing, honest. What about her? We can't just leave her here. There must be some kind of dampening field in place. If we can get one of these people to the ship, Doctor Phloxmight be able to tell us what's wrong with them. These are interesting. Who's it supposed to be? We picked up the signature from your reactor. He could probably feed and clothe half the continent with it. Captain, let me come down there and take acrack at it. Belay that! Keep this ship right where it is. Billy, stand by to vent the nacelles on my order. We're not going anywhere. Anything? Transfer the coordinates. This'd be a lot easier if you'd stoprocking the boat.

Her methods may be unrefined, but this woman is using forensictechniques far more sophisticated than I would've expected. Isn't itextraordinary? Thousands of sentient species in our little corner ofthe cosmos, each one discovering science in their own unique way.

You'renot here to pick up any antiques. I've been watching the shop forweeks. I know all about your evening deliveries. People are getting sick. Some are even dying because of what'sgoing on in here. Did you know that? Move away from the door. What did you do to me? That's the second lie you've told me. You're not very good atit. Why did you bring me back here. Did Garos tell you to? Are youworking for him? You don't know who I'm talking about. He owns the shop you brokeinto. Wait. If you don't work for him, what were you doing in there? Which city? Who sent you? I suppose telling me nothing is better than another lie. You didn't tell me your name. Jon. How far away is this city? Yes. Hello. Who's your friend? If you're careful not to touch anything. You two are from thesame province? Must be difficult to make friends when you keep so much toyourself. Yes, you do. Turn down thatflame, please. Why don't you tell me why you were in Garos's shop. What kind of machine? I can't tell you much. People are dying and I can't determinewhy. Drop this in the water, carefully. I learned of the epidemic abouteighteen months ago. My brother was one of the first victims. At first I thought it was some kind of airborne contagion, butit never spread beyond this part of the city. I'm sampled the soil, thewater, I can't find anything out of the ordinary. The first cases occurred here A fewhundred metres from his shop. That was just one month after he arrived. Every few nights, someone carries crates from his shop todifferent places outside the city. When I've gone back in the morning,crates are gone. Hand me that. Tea. Would you like some? Samples from threenew subjects indicate no Sorry. I mutter when I'm writing sometimes. It's an old habit. My mother bought me a tousorobco once, but it tuployo pludak. All right? I'm all right. I understand. Not before I see what's in those crates. Help me open this. Have you ever seen anything like that? Jon! Is there anything else you'd like to tell me, Jon? If your ship can travel to so many starsthen why would you come here? Me? Why? We're so backward compared to you. Can't you use your device? What are we looking for? Here. This is Tengala Street. Here'sthe shop. This outline could have something to do with the energyfield. Wait, what are you doing? What about the yellow dots? How do we know they don't represent the field? Maybe it's theyellow button. That's what worries me. Blue. Jon. The oil lamp. There should be at least a litre of residic oil in the containerbelow it. Residic oil ignites at three hundred and ninety eightdegrees. You wouldn't happen to have anything that gets that hot? Just one? What if Garos comes back? They could stop by for tea. Who'd believe me anyway? Where is your starship headed now? Is your translator broken again?"
347,ENT,episode 7,GAROS,"Welcome, gentlemen. If I don't have what you're looking for, I'mcertain I can find someone who does. Can I help you? Were you looking for something in particular? You won't find a more varied collection in the entire city. Thisis the pride of my entire collection. Draylan, the mythical ruler of the afterworld. You're not from this province, are you? Nor does yours. I see why you havea fondness for masks. Who are you? Earth? I never heard of it. How did you know I was here? I'm an explorer as well. At least, I used to be. I'm from theMalurian system. Two years ago I led a survey mission to study theAkaali. We had no plans to remain here, but after a few months I foundmyself quite taken with these people, so I decided to stay. There's nothing nefarious about it, I assure you. The reactorpowers a fabrication device. It allows me to make food and clothing. I see you've met our apothecary. She's been making baseless accusations against me for months. There's a lethal virus spreading among the Akaali, but it's indigenous. I certainly didn't bring it here. Unfortunately these people don't havethe medical technology to cure it, so this woman blames the newcomer,me. Perhaps some other time, Captain. Excuse me. Welcome. If I don'thave what you're looking for I'm certain I can find someone who does. Gentlemen. I suggest you leave this system at once or myship will open fire. That won't be possible. He's dead. My vessel is capable of firing ten of thosecharges simultaneously. Again, I suggest you break orbit. How did you learn aboutthis facility, Captain? Was it from a somewhat ugly Tellarite merchantperhaps? I forgot. You're explorers. There are five hundred million Akaali on this planet. A fewthousand won't be missed. I'm willing to let you go, provided youpromise not to return. We've instructed your ship to send down a launchvehicle to take you and the woman. Believe me, she'll be better off on your ship.

351,ENT,episode 8,ARCHER,"Archer. Put him through. Admiral. Good to see you. We're getting ready to deploy the first subspace amplifier. Should clear up reception a bit. Something tells me you didn't call at four in the morning totalk about comets. Sir? What's the problem? We're on our way. I think our day's going to start a little early. Ensign? Any other ships in the region. Open a channel. Fortunate, this is Captain Jonathan Archer ofthe Starship Enterprise. Fortunate, please respond. Have Doctor Phlox meet us in the Launch bay. Easy does it. There's a lot of debris outhere. Permission to come aboard. Jonathan Archer, Captain of the Enterprise. Sorry we couldn'tmeet under better circumstances. What happened here? Nausicaans? I've got repair teams standing by. What can we do? Where's your Captain? We've come an awfully long way. It would be a shame to turnaround without lending a hand. Since we have to stick around, we might as well help you getyour ship up and running. I understand you're used to doing things on your own, but we'rehere. Use us. We might be able to upgrade your hull plating, yourweapons. Couldn't hurt the next time you run into these Nausicaans. Thesooner you're back at warp, the sooner that cargo you're hauling getsto where it's supposed to go. Go ahead. Acknowledged. Those engine parts Mister Tucker gave you working out okay? Good. Doctor Phlox tells me Captain Keene's condition isimproving. Anything else we can do? There's one other question I'd like to ask you. Are there onlyhumans on board your ship? T'Pol's scanner picked up a Nausicaan biosign. You know that's not what we're saying. Why don't you tell uswhat's going on over there. What gives you the right to take prisoners? I want to see him. What do you plan to do with him? You're right, but there is one thing I do have jurisdictionover. Archer to Tucker. I want you to remove all the spare parts and equipment youinstalled on the Fortunate. You heard me, Trip. Watch me. Where? Don't do this. Ryan! You're making a big mistake. Go. Ryan! We're fine. I don't want the Fortunate leaving. Trip, report. How're you doing, Trip? Follow them. Belay that, Trip. Send a shuttlepod over here to pick us up. We've sprung a leak. How long till they're back online? Come in. I think I can squeeze you in. What'son your mind, Travis? Any time. Go on. You served on one of those freighters. I want to hear youropinion. So you think we should just let Ryan take on the Nausicaans? So what happens to the Nausicaans? Suppose Ryan finds the ship that attacked him. Maybe it's beendamaged and the Fortunate is more than a match for them. What do youthink Ryan'll do? I don't know about you, Travis, but that doesn't sit right withme. Human beings have a code of behaviour that applies whether they'reStarfleet officers or space boomers, and it isn't driven by revenge. Just because someone isn't born on Earth doesn't make him any lesshuman. Any other orders of mine you'd like to question? Who's doing the shooting? Lay in a course. Polarise the hull plating. Drop us out of warp. Are we inrange? Put it up. Hail the Nausicaans. Lets see who answers. There's a lot of firing going on for a rescue. 2 Perhaps we have an opportunity here to improve relationsbetween your people and mine. 2 I have a proposal for you. We'll get your man back and thenyou'll let the Fortunate continue on her way. 2 We've scanned your ships. Mister Reed. You're not sneaking up on an old freighter this time. This isan NX Class Starship. Take a good look, because you'll be seeing moreof them. Now, you can reconsider my offer or you can take your chances. 2 Enterprise to Ryan. This is Jonathan Archer. We're tenthousand metres off your starboard bow. I know you can hear me. Whydon't you think about what's best for your crew and let us help you? I've spoken To the Nausicaan Captain. He's willing tolet the Fortunate go if you turn over his crewman. I've got an armoury of torpedoes that will make sure theydo. You've got a chance to stop this before anyone else gets hurt. This has gone on long enough. Now you're putting my crew indanger. Release that hostage. Return fire. Starboard tubes three and four. Port tubes one and two, fire. Need a hand? I'm on duty. If you think he's going to be a problem, we could take him backto Earth. Understood. His intentions were good, but someone should teach him toaccept help when it's offered. They're going to be seeing a lot more ships than they're usedto. Maybe that's not so bad. At warp three, help's a lot closerthan before. You won't have to go it alone. I think you've already done that. Good luck. Thanks, but my crew's anxious to get underway. Next time. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

Some of it doesn't appear to be from the Fortunate. The main hatch is damaged. No chance we'll get a positive seal. If you didn't need our help, why did you send out a distresscall? Get down. What was that? We're trying to track their warp trail, buttheir plasma cannon knocked out our long range sensors. It's difficult to be sure at this distance, sir. Looks like somekind of plasma discharge. I can't rule out our boomer friends. It's the Fortunate, sir, and three smallerships. Fore and aft plasma cannons. I doubt those shields of theirswould hold up to our torpedoes. One of the Nausicaan ships has locked weapons on us, sir. The Nausicaan ships are firing, sir. The Nausicaans are powering down theirweapons. They're moving off, sir."

362,ENT,episode 8,T'POL,"The Earth cargo ship Fortunate. Y-classfreighter, maximum speed warp one point eight. Crew complement twentythree. Do you have any helpful information on this vessel beyond itsrecreational activities? None, Captain. I'm reading twenty four biosigns. Why is power being rerouted from internal sensors to the weaponssystems? The battle is over. I'll remove the bypass. I'm sorry, I don't know which child is named Nadine. I just told him the truth. T'Pol to Archer. The repairs are almost finished, Captain. But there is something I need to speak to you about, inprivate. It isn't. My bioscans indicated this Nausicaan was injured. I'm reading one biosign, but it's not Nausicaan. Captain, there's a breach. The Fortunate has fired its weapons. Captain, considering our rate of decompression, I'd suggestEnterprise retrieve us as quickly as possible. Mister Tucker says at least four hours. A very primitive emotion, but it would explain his irrationalbehaviour. Captain, long range sensors are detectingweapons fire. Nausicaans. There are four Nausicaan biosigns on board the Fortunate and I'mdetecting weapon discharges."

You missed the best part. The only warp five engine in thefleet. Once they get installed in the next generation of freightersit'll change a whole lot of things. Go ahead, Captain. Sir? What the hell's going on over there? Tucker to Captain Archer. Are you all right? Understood. Hail them. Polarise the hull plating. They're getting a little trigger-happy, sir. Stand by. Load starboard tubes three and four. Target their engines. Fire. Enterprise to Archer. We're okay, sir. We didn't take too much damage, but theFortunate just went to warp. On our way. Anything? I don't know what's going on with that guy. I can understandtaking on those pirates. I probably would have done the same thing. Butfiring on a Starfleet vessel? He's got a lot more than pirates to worryabout now. Things are changing. Ryan's going to have to figure that out. Got it. Sensors are back online."

376,ENT,episode 8,TRAVIS,"Not counting newborn babies. I grew up on a J-class, a little smaller but the same basicdesign, and one thing I can tell you is that at warp one point eightyou've got a lot of time on your hands between ports. That's how myparents wound up with me. Well, typically nothing more than a low-yield plasma cannon,but most freight haulers would've upgraded the first chance they got. Think about it. You're a dozen light years from home withtwenty kilotons of dilithium ore in your hold, armed with nothing but apop-gun for shooting oncoming meteors. What would you do? Aye sir. There should be an auxiliary hatch on the port side. Pirates, sir. They've been attacking freighters in this sectorfor years. My parents had a run-in with them once. They were lucky tocome out of it alive. Still do. An old J-class, the Horizon. He's got a lot more experience than any freighter medic I know. Trip'll geta kick out of this, it's older than he is. The Quartermaster won't haveanything like it but Engineering should be able to make one for you. I'm sure your guys have their hands full. We're happy to do it. Enterprise came with all the trimmings. Not yet. Most of the crew is afraid, but I'm kind of curious totry it out. Why do you think I want to try it. I was born on her, halfway betweenDraylax and Vega Colony. I've still got my sister and her husband aboard the Horizon,but I know my dad expected me to take over at some point. I had to figure out where I wanted to spend the rest of mylife, and I was pretty sure it wasn't on the Draylax - Vega run. Besides, the Horizon didn't have transporters to play with. Even with a warp three engine you'd be able to cut a five yearcargo run down to six months. Save room for dessert, home madeice-cream. Chef's the best in Starfleet. I heard the Captain had to callin a lot of favours to get him on board. It's good you stayed away fromthe resequenced meat loaf. They still haven't gotten that right. That's because it is. I remember those. What did we used to call them? My dad was a pretty good cook. He could do magical things withthose nutri-paks. Didn't stop you from eating it. Your parents on the Fortunate? Were you on board? I'm sorry. You ever think about doing something else? The food's not bad. No, but you've spent more time in space than most StarfleetCaptains. There are three more NX class ships on the drawing boards. They're going to need experienced people. Don't worry, not everybody's going to go. You think leaving the Horizon was easy for me? That I just tookoff because I got tired of the food? That ship was my home. Being in Starfleet is the best thing that ever happened to me. My parents weren't happy I left, but they respected my decision. They're charging weapons. Aye, sir. They're jettisoning our pod. Their warpdrive's coming online. We don't know where they are, but we know who they're lookingfor. The Nausicaans. Ryan's after revenge, sir. It's rational to him. Those pirates attacked his ship. That'shis family. If we want to find the Fortunate, we need to find theNausicaans. No. Try bypassing circuit L-47. Never thought I'd see a Y-class running from any ship I was on. When I was growing up on the Horizon, anything that happened on boardyou handles yourself. If someone on the crew got into a fight, you justworked it out. You took care of your own. If Starfleet suddenly showedup and told my father what he could and couldn't do on his own ship? Maybe he already has and he just doesn't like it. Do you have a minute, sir? Permission to speak freely, sir? I'm worried that we're not handling the situation the rightway. You know I'd never question your orders. Maybe Ryan's right. Maybe this isn't any of our business. If hedoesn't want our help, why force it on him. Don't underestimate a freighter crew, sir. My father never raninto any trouble he couldn't handle himself, Nausicaans included. Sir? He'd probably try to blow them out of the sky. You're right, sir. I suppose I should understand that more thananyone. Not today, sir. Thank you, sir. Aye, sir. He wouldn't be there if you hadn't attacked them in the firstplace. What are you going to do, kill him? Sir, with your permission. You think killing one of them isgoing to accomplish anything? Just shut up and listen to me. I don't give a damn aboutyou any more. I'm just thinking about my family. What's going to happen to the next freighter that runs into theNausicaans? What if it's the Horizon and they have to pay the price foryour Stubborn stupidity. The hell you are! This isn't aboutprotecting cargo ships. Don't kid yourself into thinking you're doing this for somegreater good. This is about revenge, nothing else. You don't like me because I left the Horizon to join Starfleet. You're afraid that if more people do that there won't be anyone left torun the freighters. Maybe you're right Maybe not. But if you don't let yourhostage go The Nausicaans are going to kill you andyour crew. And then there'll be twenty three fewer people out there to runthose freighters. No maybes."

The nearest Starfleet vessel isthree weeks away at its maximum warp, but you could be there in a dayand a half. We're not sure. They're not responding to hails. I'd like you to check this out.

That's all right. You can just leave them. No. You nearly killed him. What about the Nausicaan? We've got what we wanted. Let's just get him off the ship. An escape pod. I've been asking myself the same question. We've always dealtwith the Nausicaans without taking hostages or beating information outof them. How would the Captain want us to handle this? I've seen that hull signature enough times. Loaded and standing by. They're just sitting there, a hundred kilometres ahead near asmall asteroid. We're closing. Twenty kilometres. They're firing. The hullplating is holding. We're out of range. Ten kilometres, nine. Cannons locked on target. They've gone behind the asteroid. I've lost the lock. I'm getting us out of here. Ryan! No effect. I used the ones he gave us. The reactor is offline. We've lost impulse. They're hailing us. 2 They've latched onto us. They're in the access corridor, section D. Three. We know what they're after. Why not just let them havehim> It was one ship, not three. We should pull back. We'd better get him to the infirmary."

You're facing three of my ships. We arenot interested in your proposals. If you think you can convince them toreturn our crewman, do it quickly. Otherwise we'll be forced to takeour chances."
409,ENT,episode 8,RYAN,"Like to see you make that catch with the gravity plating at Earthsea level. One more reason not to go. The cargo handlers at Jupiter Station. They didn't balance theload. Shaw and I, we, er, we trimmed it out. Granted. I'm Matthew Ryan, first officer. Nausicaans. They tried to board us. We managed to fight them offbut not before we took a few bruises. Your parents ran freight? Oh, we can handle this ourselves, Captain, but thank you. One of our younger crewmembers panicked, hit the emergencybeacon. With our comm. down we had no way to tell Starfleet to ignoreit. He was wounded in the attack. I'm in command until he's back onhis feet. I'm sorry we took valuable time away from your mission. Is he going to die? How long? That's all right. A few engineers, that's all. We'll keep them where they're supposed to be. What do you want me to do, throw him off the ship? Anything? Keep at it. I want those codes. We've got our own machine shop. That's a transporter. I've read about them. Have you been through it? They say that for a split second you can actually feel yourselfin both places at once. So you were on the Horizon? How do your parents feel about you leaving? Then why'd you leave? Thanks. I've already seen most of the ship. I've heard about it. Warp one point eight works just fine for us. Any faster andthere'd be no time to enjoy the trip. You eat this well all the time? Resequenced? This tastes real. You know the last time I had a steak? Eighteen months ago. Allwe've got left now are hydroponics and nutri-paks. When it was someone's birthday my mother would bake a cake. Weknew batter than to ask what it was made of. Oh, no way. No. They were on the North Star. Yeah, I was one of the survivors. I went to the Fortunate afterthat. Running freight is dangerous. You mean join Starfleet? Was this premeditated? Buy me lunch and give me the recruitingpitch? If Starfleet gets all the good crews, who does that leave to runthe freighters? You did. So why'd you leave it? Why did you abandon your family. Did they? Or were they just saying what you wanted to hear so youwouldn't feel guilty. Commander Tucker should be done with my valveassembly by now. Thanks for lunch. Some of the connections were off by a few microns, but theyshould be fine. Well he's still unconscious but the burns are healing, thanks toyour doctor. Thanks, but we're anxious to get underway. Goodbye, Captain. I think one of the kids has a Teneebian skunk as a pet, if that'swhat you mean. Are you saying we've got a stowaway? Well, what are you talking about? Okay. Not that it's any of your business, but there is aNausicaan aboard. He's my prisoner. They have been attacking our ship for months, stealing our cargo. They nearly killed my Captain. Now what gives them the right to dothat? And what would you do? Take him back to Nausicaa? They'd probablygive him a medal. That is my business. Starfleet doesn't have any jurisdiction overwhat goes on aboard my ship. You wouldn't do that. He's in there. He's tied up over there. The frequencies. Give me the frequencies. I'm counting on it. That wasn't so difficult, was it. Remodulate the weapons. Keep him locked up. We might still need him. How? So his friends can pick him up and he can tell them to changetheir shield modulations? What was the point of all this? If we don't show them that we're serious, they're never going toleave us alone. I'm responsible for this ship now, and I need to know that youare going to help me do whatever it takes to protect her. We've taken enough casualties. It's time we started inflicting some ofour own. Captain's starlog, supplemental. We've picked up afaint warp trail that could be the Fortunate, but we don't know forsure until our long range sensors are back online. Are you sure? The new shield frequencies? Bring the cannons online, drop out of warp. Put it on the viewer. They've seenus. Lay in an intercept course. Full impulse. Can you get a weapons lock? Then get us into range. Return fire. This must be where they offload stolen cargo. Hold your course. We still have their shield frequencies. Lock weapons on the firstship and fire. Again. Are you sure you programmed the right frequencies? Go to warp! Full impulse, then. Hull plating to maximum. He's our prisoner. 2 How many? Pass out weapons. We fought them off before, we can do it again. Weapons. He's going to be okay. Shut up. 2 What a relief. Starfleet's come to save the day. What, and you believe him? You believethey're just going to let us fly away? What about next time, when another freighter gets jumped In the middle of nowhere. What then? I'm dealing with them the only way they understand. He's my prisoner, and I'm going to handle This in my way. Oh, you again. What, your Captain decide a little boomer toboomer talk would persuade me? What have they got to do with this? I'm doing this for them. That is just what it's about. Hold your fire! Take him."

412,ENT,episode 8,KEENE,"Hauled down in the corner of the end zone. Touchdown! I doubt you could throw the ball ten metres on Earth. Did you find out what was causing that vibration in module two? Keep an eye on it. Drop out of warp. Charge the plasma cannon. Just a little stiff. Thank yourdoctor for me. I've got some Drilaxian whisky stashed away, if you'dlike to join me. Too bad. If you've never had it, you're missing one of thegalaxy's real pleasures. I'm reducing Mister Ryan's rank to AbleCrewman. He gets to spend the rest of the trip purging hydraulic pumps. No, we take care of our own. Besides, that would leave me a manshort. I made him my first officer because I trusted him with my ship. It's going to take him quite a while to earn that back. The ones that grew up out here feel they have some specialclaim, that this particular stretch of space is theirs. They seeanother ship within ten light years, they get jumpy. The ships get faster. It's progress, I suppose. My family's beenon the Fortunate for three generations. Now, I'm going to need at leasta warp three engine to stay in business. Going it alone's all I've ever done, and for some of us it's thereason we're out here. A chance to prove ourselves. Well, we'll adapt, we always have, but things just won't be thesame.

We thought we might go say hello. No, thanks, I'm fine. What have you got? Put it up. Hail them. My name is Archer. I'm Captain of the starship Enterprise. We're from Earth. We thought we'd introduce ourselves. Nothing. We're new to this region and we're eager to makecontact with other species. If you don't mind my asking, what brings you here? The, the what? Mind if we join you? I'd like to extend an invitation to you and your passengers tovisit Enterprise. Understood, Mister? Looks like we could be having guests. Tell Chef to preparesomething. Welcome aboard. Captain Jonathan Archer. It's customary onEarth to greet someone with a handshake. Thanks. It's beautiful. What exactly is it? You're very generous. I'm afraid the only thing we have tooffer you is our hospitality. Our chef has prepared a meal in your honour. Please. Four months, three weeks and We've seen a lot since we left Earth but I have to say thatthis place is definitely one of the highlights. I didn't realise you were familiar with Earth religions,Doctor. I guess you could say I try to keep an open mind. Excuse me. Archer to the Bridge. Report. I'm afraid we have to cut the tour a little short. I'll be onthe Bridge. Report. Trip. What's happening? Good work, Trip. Sorry about the bad weather. If any of your group would like to watch the Great Plume fromour Mess Hall, they're welcome to come back tomorrow. Have a great time, Doctor. I'll expect a full report in the morning. Hope to see you tomorrow. Go ahead, Trip. On my way. What is it, Trip? What? Yeah. What are you getting at? One of your staff? Sounds to me like you've got a hero who's a little reluctantabout taking credit. Talk to them again. Whoever did this deserves acommendation. Thank you, Captain. If anyone comes forward, you'll let me know? Why don't you talk to one of my Bridge officers. I'm a littlebusy right now. I'm sorry Daniels, I've got my hands full. What about them? How the hell do you know what I did on the Helix? My ready room. What? What is that? That doesn't look like Starfleet issue. Who are you? How do you know what happened on the Helix? I'm the one asking questions, crewman. What do you know about that? If you're not a member of Starfleet, then who are you? I've never heard of a group like that. So you're telling me you're some kind of a time traveller? Overwhelming doesn't quite cover it. Are you human? And the people giving Silik orders? But not you? Sounds dangerous. But it wasn't. That's what the Temporal Cold War is all about. Why are you telling me all this? Are you implying Silik was sent here to save my ship, and if hehadn't we would have been destroyed today? You're from nine hundred years in the future, and you need myhelp? I've noticed. If I decide to help you I can't do it alone. I need to informsome of my crew. You sure you don't want a glass? The Suliban woman I spoke with, Sarin, she also used the phraseTemporal Cold War. The same words. What about the Suliban's genetic engineering? Phlox says it'sfar beyond their abilities. I'm telling you, he pushed a button on this device and thewhole room changed. If there's even a possibility that this cold war exists, wecan't ignore Daniels' request. Yes, Hoshi. Initiate docking procedures. I'll be rightthere. One of them might be Silik. We don't have time to debate thisany longer. I want you to help Daniels. I take it you enjoyed your visit. How many decided to join us? So that leaves six on the transport? Did any of them seem out of place? Did they all take part in the rituals? No, just curious. It's been a long night. Glad you had a good time. Enjoy theview. I know, I know, your breakfast is two hours late. Don't give methat look. If it's any consolation I missed my breakfast, too. What's the problem? You're not getting any cheese. What are you doing here? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know. And why would you want to do that? The first time we met, youtried to kill me. By whom? What does Enterprise have to do with your temporalwar? Archer here. Thanks. I'll be there in a few minutes. He'll have to wait a few minutes. Archer out. It was Silik. I guess he decided not to try and kill me thistime. Have our guests left yet? Enterprise to Captain Fraddock. I'm looking for one of your passengers. Have any of the oneswho were here returned in the last hour or so? You're sure? Thanks. Archer out. Mister Reed. We've got a Suliban loose on the ship. I want you to lock down every outer doorand exit hatch. Post security teams on all decks. Do you think you can find him using Daniels' sensors? Get to Engineering. T'Pol. Thanks, Doc. It's gone. He took it. The device I told you about. The one Daniels used to show meall those things. That kind of information could give an advantage towhomever Silik's working for. Go ahead. What kind of message? Anything? Tell Malcolm to meet me with a security team. Stay here. Put that device on the floor. You keep saying you're here to help us, but I can't stopwondering what kind of genetic enhancements you'll get for bringingback that little prize. Eyes in the back of your head? A pair of wings? I'm not going to ask you again. Put itdown. Yeah. No. Let 'em go. Come in. Not a clue. Starfleet's in store for one hell of a report. I'mnot quite sure where to begin. First thing in the morning. I don't know about you, but I coulduse a good night's sleep. Mister Reed, assign new quarters toDaniels' roommate and seal off cabin E-14. It's off-limits til furthernotice. God knows what else is in there. Let's get back on the road,Travis. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Still, we're not familiar with these species. Tactical systemsshould be off-limits. Starboard targeting sensor's out again. No. I'll take care of it. It'll only take a moment. You have theBridge, Ensign. Permission to take my station? That one hit our port bow. Power's down onC-Deck, subsection four. No other damage. We're losing main power. Yes, sir. Understood. Looks like he slipped through here. We couldremove these conduits but it would take some time. Sir? Aye, sir."

426,ENT,episode 9,T'POL,"It appears to be a transport vessel. When is this Great Plume due to erupt? Six days. Our beliefs are based on logic and the pursuitof clarity. On screen. We're aware of it. Twice. Agreed. Ensign. We're circumnavigating a plasma storm,Captain. It's just turbulence from the outeredge. Ensign. What about the transport ship? I'm sure. The Vulcan Science Directorate has studied thequestion of time travel in great detail. They found no evidence that itexists or that it can exist. That proves nothing. That doesn't mean that it was given to them by visitors from thefuture. Until Daniels can offer you concrete proof, I'd remainextremely skeptical. If Daniels could travel through time why not simply go back onemore day into the past and prevent Silik from boarding this ship in thefirst place? Or maybe he's really not from the future. He could be trying to conceal his true intentions. There's a difference between keeping an open mind and believingsomething because you want it to be true. Commander? One of the power relays is offline. T'Pol to Captain Archer. We've finished the modifications. Mister Daniels is eager to get started. What is it? He's in his quarters. No, the Plume is just beginning. Captain? Took what? Bridge to Captain Archer. A Suliban vessel just took something in andwent to warp. Should we go after them? The transport ship has left. We're ready to resume course. Haveyou learned how it works? I'd be glad to help. Agreed."
427,ENT,episode 9,TUCKER,"Seal's good. I'm Commander Tucker, Chief Engineer, and this is our ScienceOfficer, Sub-commander T'Pol. Mmm, I'm sure it does. Warp five will get you where you're going pretty fast. And the Great Plume of A, Ager? Agosoria. How does that fit in? The gravimetric field displacementmanifold, commonly known as the warp reactor. Just think of it as agreat big engine but instead of using electricity or chemical fuel itruns on antimatter. See this swirling light? When matter and antimattercollide it creates a whole lot of energy. We channel that energythrough those conduits over there. They lead to the two large glowingcylinders you may have seen on the outside of the ship. That's right. I see you already know a thing or two about starship engines. Oh. Well, I guess that covers the basics. Any questions? Good one. I'll bring up the schematic of the reactor assemblyand you can see for yourself. If you'll just come with me. We use aseries of magnetic constrictors to align the positron stream. If any stray particles escape backups automatically kick in. During one of our training tests we momentarily lost the primaries andthe backups. About a billion positrons cut through the plating on threedecks. Nearly caused a hull breach. We spent a month redesigning thesystem. It hasn't given us a single problem since. We've got a power surge in the impulserelays. Here's a good example of how we can reroute the energy flow toprotect our critical systems. That last bolt struck the warp manifold! We've got an antimatter cascade, sir! If it reaches the warp reactor we're goingto I think we'reall right, Captain. The cascade stopped in its tracks. It wasn't me, sir. Tucker to Captain Archer. Can you come down to Engineering for a minute? Take a look at this. Right up there. See that conduit? It's an antimatter junction. It stopped the cascade fromreaching the warp reactor. Somebody got in here and disconnected it from the primaryantimatter feed. If they hadn't, that cascade would have continuedright into the reactor core, and this ship would have gone up just likethe Great Plume of Agosoria. I already asked. Nobody seems to know anything about it. I'm telling you, sir, I don't think it was one of my people. They would have said something. How about the warp theorist? That's what Daniels called it? On the Xyrillian ship I was in a holographic chamber where Icould've sworn I was in a boat at sea. If what Daniels says is true,then Silik saved Enterprise. Maybe we shouldn't look a gift horse inthe mouth. I always knew we'd be meeting people fromother planets, but other centuries? You're not buying any of this, areyou? Maybe that's plan B. Then why make up such a crazy story? I thought you scientists were supposed to keep an open mind. What the hell's that supposed to mean? The grid can handle it. So I take it your brother isn't reallyan orbital engineer at Jupiter Station. And you didn't grow up in Illinois. It's good to know Earth will still be around in nine hundredyears. Beg your pardon? Right. What's this? You know, we've got a little pool going in Engineering where wetry to guess how far the ship will travel each day. I don't suppose youcould give me a tip on tomorrow's distance. Must have been damaged during the plasma storm. J-37. It'sabout three metres behind that bulkhead. Does this mean it's working? What's that? We're not leaving. Evacuate Engineering. Everybody out! Still skeptical? Tucker to Captain Archer. Captain, are youthere? Tucker to Doctor Phlox. Meet us in the Captain's quarters on the double. He wasn't quite as generous when it came to Daniels. He's dead,sir. I can sure as hell try. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Captain. I can't make heads or tails of most ofthis. These might represent Suliban bio-signs but I wouldn't bet on it. B-deck, service junction 59. Somebody's trying to bypass thelock out codes for Launch Bay Two. Captain, I've got something that might give you a leg up."
428,ENT,episode 9,SILIK,"This wasn't part of our agreement. Please, I won't disappoint you again. But you're disabling me. If you're thinking of calling for help I'd advise against it. I'm not the one you should be worried about, Jon. I thought you might want to thank me. I saved your life. Theleast you could do is return the favour. There's someone here trying tofind me. I need to know who it is. I detected tachyon radiation. You don't have anything that emitstachyons. Who's looking for me? Did they tell you that ridiculous story about their nobleefforts to protect history? The great Temporal Accord? They're lying toyou, Jon. None of it is true. Whoever contacted you is working foranother faction. They didn't come here to protect history. They came toalter it. Who do you think was responsible for the antimatter cascadethat nearly destroyed your ship? It was them. I was sent to prevent it. I saved your ship because I was instructed to. I'm not privy to that kind of information, but I can tell youthis. Whoever's looking for me is a danger to your crew. If you want tocontinue on your mission you'll help me find them. You've been very helpful, Jon. Did they tell you that the twenty second century wasgoing to be your final resting place? Very clever. Careful, Jon. It would be ashame to trigger another antimatter cascade. There'd be nobody here tostop it. It would be in your best interest to let me take it. That's a cynical attitude, Jon. I thought your species was moretrusting. You're going to kill me after I saved your life? You may have endangered your future, Jon."

I attended Mass at SaintPeter's Square. I was even allowed to observe the Tal-Shanar at theVulcan consulate. There's your heart, lungs, liver, another heart. Everyorgan. This imaging device also allows us to examine your geneticstructure. Ah, you'll be happy to know you're in perfect health. Whowould like to go next? I plan to, Captain. Thank you for letting me spend the nightwith these people. Aye, Captain. . Roja durana tua teenan, Captain. That is atraditional greeting on the morning of Agosoria. It means, may thePlume light your way. Oh, it was mesmerising. Four hours of ritual prayer followed bythe Kaana-sah, a series of exercises designed to purify the body. Ithink I strained a leg muscle, but it was well worth it. Eleven, I believe. The others wanted to observe the star fromtheir ship. I didn't take a head count but that sounds about right. How do you mean? As far as I could tell, but our eyes were closed most of thetime. Is there something wrong, Captain? You seem a little preoccupied. I will. How long before we see the Plume? I'd be honoured. Goran tonia Agosoria. Yoraya uralan porporo gost. Totonya tur eeta dura. Tyana morita. Yes, Commander. On my way. Easy, Captain. Aside from a nasty headache, you're going to befine.

Haven't you ever wondered what it's like? Okay. We're being hailed by Captain Fraddock. Bridge to Captain Archer. We're approaching the protostar, sir And the transport ship is requestingpermission to dock. Some of the passengers would like to take you up onyour offer and observe it from the Mess Hall.

I can wait till I'm promoted. Nice fit.Â Bridge looks a lot different from here. Think anyone would mind if I fired a torpedo? Sorry, sir. He's probably calling about the weather. I'm already on it.

477,ENT,episode 9,DANIELS,"Good morning, sir. I switched with him, if that's all right with you. Sir, I noticed we changed course. May I ask why? Very good, sir. More orange juice? Sir, I need to speak with you. It's important. It's about the Suliban. I've reason to believe that one of the pilgrims who cameaboard today is a Suliban soldier. His name is Silik. He's the man youfought with on the Helix. It might be best if we discussed this in private. I think it'd be better if we went to my quarters. You'll understand when we get there, sir. Oh, please, have a seat. I'm sorry about the mess. Sometimes Ithink my bunk-mate majored in Chaos Theory. That's because I'm not a member of Starfleet. Not that Iwouldn't be honoured to be one, sir, especially after spending time Did Silik tell you who he was working for? Did he mention the Temporal Cold War? A great deal more than you do, sir. I work for a different kind of organization. We make sure thatpeople like Silik don't interfere with historical events. That's because it doesn't exist yet. That's one way of putting it. Maybe this'll help clear thingsup. This is how we keep an eye on what's going on. You might callit a Temporal Observatory. I know this must seem a little overwhelming. I come from right about, right about here. Approximately ninehundred years from now. More or less. They're from an earlier century. From about here. They can'tmanifest themselves physically in the past. They can only partiallymaterialise to deliver information. In the years that followed we eventually perfected theprocess. When time travel was first developed, it wasn't long beforepeople realised that laws had to be made. All the species who had thetechnology agreed that it would only be used for research. Look at this. This is a group of anthropologists from 2769observing the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza. They're doingit using the proper procedures set forth in the Temporal Accord. Butthere are factions that ignore those procedures. Silik is the one who prevented thereactor breach. I am not implying anything. All I'm saying is that I wasassigned here to capture Silik when he came aboard. He is a threat andI need you to help me capture him. The Suliban have been given genetic enhancements that allowthem to evade most sensors. They're nearly impossible to detect. I have special equipment that can help track Silik but it'llbe far more effective if I can tie it into your internal sensor grid. I'll need access to Main Engineering and your command codes. But wehave reason to believe that the twenty second century is a front inthis cold war. What happens here could affect millennia to come. It'simperative that we find out who Silik is working for and what they'retrying to do. The fewer the better. You're asking me to capture someone whojust saved my ship. Why should I trust you? You like your scrambled eggs soft. Have I ever brought them toyou any other way? My equipment draws a lot of power. I'llneed another twenty megawatts routed to your sensor grid. Actually, I don't have a brother. Oh, I'm from a place called Illinois, sir. Just not the oneyou're familiar with. That depends on how you define Earth. You might want to initialise the grid. I'm ready to downloadthe biometric parameters. It's very delicate. Please don't. Please don't touch it. I'm afraid we don't monitor events quite that closely. I'll take care of it. J-37? Try it now. It's working. Suliban biosigns. He's somewhere on this deck. I can't isolatehim, but he's close. Call Lieutenant Reed. Tell him to seal off C Deck. And it wouldn't hurt if he could get down here with a security team. You two should go. Go! Bring help. Go."
478,ENT,episode 9,FRADDOCK,"Can I help you? Pleased to meet you. What do you want? Oh. A job. I'm escorting a group of spirituallyminded men on a pilgrimage to the Great Plume of Agosoria. Every eleven years, one of the protostarsgives out a neutron blast. These gentlemen believe it's a sacred event. If you ask me, I think it's just another ball of hydrogen. Tomorrow. It's your time to waste. I'll ask them if they're interested. I preferto stay with my ship. Fraddock. Captain Fraddock. You might want to focus your sensors on thatplasma lightning up ahead. You ever been in a plasma storm? Then you know it can get a little bumpy. Isuggest we try and go around it. I spoke with every one of them. Him, too. None of them went anywhere near that conduit. If Itold you I did it, would there be some kind of reward? Maybe it was the Cycle of Renewal. Oh, you'll be the first. Fraddock. None. The hatch has been sealed the entire time."
479,ENT,episode 9,SONSORRA,"Voo-Sinteel. It's a spirit traditionally consumed as the Plume reaches itsfull brilliance. You'll find it enhances the experience. Agosoria. I understand Vulcans are a deeply spiritual people. Do you follow a particular faith, Captain? The nacelles. Which contain warp coils that create the subspacedisplacement field. I'm a warp field theorist."
480,ENT,episode 9,MANTOOS,"I'm Prah Mantoos. May Agosoria embrace you into hiscycle of renewal. These are my fellow celebrants. We've travelled many lightyears from different worlds to watch this event. For you, Captain. A clock. It charts time from the beginning of the universe. That will be more than enough. Normally we fast during the Time of Agosoria, but in this caseI suppose we can break with tradition. You've travelled a great distance in a short period of time. I'm pleased you appreciate its beauty, Captain. To us, it'smore than just a simple stellar nursery. According to our sacred textthis is where the universe began. It represents the continuing cycle of creation. Many who see the Great Plume are often inspired by it. Perhapsyou will be, too. They're very common in this region. I'm sure there's nothingto worry about. We're used to it. I'm just grateful there was no seriousdamage. I'll let them know. It's beginning. Well, that's hard to predict. Every cycle is unique. Would youcare to recite the Invocation of Renewal with us? Yoraya."

This is the Starship Enterprise. What can wedo for you? My name is Jonathan Archer. We're on a mission ofexploration from the planet Earth. Hoshi? Do you need assistance? If you don't want to talk, that's finebut, you dropped in on us. Was it something I said? Did you get anything on sensors? No what? Are there inhabited systems nearby? Why fly right up to us just to give us the silent treatment? Let's calibrate the subspace amplifier. At least the peopleback home want to talk to us. Where are they? What time is it there? That shouldn't be too late. Let's break in that new amplifier. I'll be in my Ready Room. He's fine. No, sir. Malcolm's doing a great job. I'm sure you know it'shis birthday in a couple of days. He's my Armoury Officer. It must be in Malcolm's blood. He's a long way from home in any case, Mister Reed. I'd like todo something for his birthday, make him a special dinner. I was hopingyou could tell me what he likes to eat. I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying he doesn't have a favourite food? Well, if you happen to think of anything you can always contactme through Starfleet. I will. Could have gone better. Apparently, he hasn't called home sincewe left Earth. I want you to find out what he likes to eat. But don't let Malcolm know. We're talking about a delicate assignment, Hoshi. It needs yourfinesse. Get some help if you need it, but make this a top priority. That's an order. Where were you atdinner? You missed T'Pol's latest bout with chopsticks. I thought you were going to upgrade this. What's the word from home? Duvall got his own command? Thank God we're a hundred lightyears away. The Natalie, from Pensacola? Trip. You okay? Let me ask you something. Do you spendmuch time with Malcolm? You talk about anything interesting? I talked to his parents this morning. Yeah. Sit. If I asked your parents what you liketo eat, would they be able to tell me? Malcolm's parents didn't know what his favorite food was. Theydidn't even know he was an Armoury Officer. It made me think. We don't know that much about Malcolm, do we? Go ahead. Guess we weren't so uninteresting afterall. Let's try this again. Welcome back. Iwas hoping we'd have an opportunity to meet again. The primary missionof my ship is to make peaceful contact with other species. If there'sanything we can do to assure you of our intentions Well, it's been nice talking to you. Let's do thisagain sometime. Can you translate it? Hull plating. Hard about. Everybody okay? What the hell was that about? What did you get? Stay on long-range scanners. If they come anywhere near us, Iwant to know. T'Pol. How bad is it? Hold it a minute. Did your people run into as many hostile aliens when they firstwent into deep space? How so? This ship just isn't equipped to handle some of the threatswe're coming up against. It's time we do something about that. Enterprise was fitted with phase cannon ports, but since weleft Spacedock a few weeks ahead of schedule the cannons were neverinstalled. I think it's time they were. Weshould head back to Earth. The armoury team at Jupiter Station is trained for this kind ofwork. If we're going to do this let's do it right. I know that, Trip, but we have other systems that could useoverhauls. Look at the bright side. You'll got a chance to say goodbyeto Natalie. Do what you can. Archer to Mayweather. We're heading home. Let me guess. Our shadow? Polarise the hull plating. Torpedoes. Why don't you save time and tell me what isn't down? Seal them. Get away from those men! Go. Archer to Sickbay. Report to E deck, section seven. This is an emergency. Go ahead. Bridge, report! Doctor? Will they be all right? Have you ever heard of anything like this? Are there any Vulcan records of a species that uses similartactics? And I don't care how classified they might be. Find out what you can. Go ahead. How long before we can go to warp? What about impulse power? I'll take all the good news I can get. Keep me posted, Doctor. I'm sure they would. What? What about Echo One? Don't you ever rest? Well, I hope you get them fixed soon because you look likehell. How's it coming? Sure. Point oh six microns. At least we'll be flying home underour own power. I tried to get a message to the Vulcan High Command, but itdidn't go through. If it had, we'd be expecting a Surak class shiptomorrow, oh so politely offering to help us. Maybe we should thank our visitors for blowing up the subspaceamplifiers. It's holding at point oh five. You looking forward to seeing Earth? This time, we won't be leaving before we're ready. I nev I never said we didn'tbelong out here. I just wish we'd have launched with all our systemsonline, especially weapons. I keep reminding myself of that. But I rushed us out ofSpacedock because I had something to prove, and I risked the lives ofeighty one humans, a Vulcan, and a Denobulan to do it. Thanks. Let me know when we're ready to go to warp. My crew has managed to do in forty eighthours what would've taken the armoury team at Jupiter Station at leasta week. To say that I'm proud of them would be an understatement. We'repreparing our first test. Everybody has their fingers crossed,including me. You're sure there's nothing down there? Not even a microbe? I don't want to blow up something thatcould evolve into a sentient species in a couple of billion years. Archer to Lieutenant Reed. Have you got a lock? Let's start small. Shave a couple of metres off the top of thatpeak. Mister Reed, the honour is all yours. Ijust asked for a little off the top. What happened? Trip, T'Pol. You think that's what's causing the power surge? Activate visual sensor J-15. I assume youplanted that device because you wanted to learn more about us. I'll be happy togive you a quick lesson. We're not here to make enemies, but justbecause we're not looking for a fight doesn't mean we'll run away fromone. You may think you've left us defenceless, but let me tell yousomething about humans. We don't give up easily. We'll protectEnterprise any way we can. Where are they? No. Come about, and hold our position. Bridge to the Armoury. Guess who's back. Get a lock and standby. Put it through. Defenceless. Prepare to surrender your vessel. You are defenseless. Prepare tosurrender your vessel. Shut it off. Mister Reed, both cannons, fire. Is that the best we can do, Lieutenant?! What about yesterday? I saw you blow something up the size ofMount McKinley. Can you overload them again? Can you overload them again? I'd rather knock out two decks thansurrender this ship. Sounds good to me. We all understand the risks. Get started. Malcolm? Then fire! Torpedoes! Bridge to the Armoury. Everything okay downthere? I have a feeling Their repairs are going to be a littlemore extensive. How'd the cannons hold up? Good work. Well, I see no reason for us togo back to Jupiter Station now. Do you? Get on it. Travis, resume our previous course. Hear, hear. Don't get too used to drinking on duty. But you did your jobspretty damn well yesterday. I'd say that deserves a little celebration. Permission granted. Hoshi, what can we do for you? Great, put it down right here. As long as we'vegot you here, Malcolm. Happybirthday. Oh, no trouble at all. Mister Reed, thehonour is yours."

What are Malcolm's duties on your ship,Captain? Well, his grandfather would be pleased. Hewas an ordinance officer himself in the Royal Navy. The Reeds have been navy men for generations. Until Malcolm decided to join Starfleet. Isuppose the ocean wasn't big enough for him. Captain, Malcolm's never been comfortablemaking requests. He always ate whatever was put in front ofhim. Not that he's ever told me. Give Malcolm our best. Safe journey, Captain. It's offline! Damage reports are coming in, sir. No one's been hurt. Captain, when they fired their weapon they dropped theirshielding for about two seconds and I was able to take some scans. Biosigns. At least fifteen, maybe more. It's a good thing they're gone. I doubt very much our torpedoescould've penetrated their shielding. Just give us two weeks, Captain. Sir, with your permission, we could at least begin the work, geta few things started for Jupiter Station. This, ladies and gentlemen is a phase-modulated energy weapon. It's rated for a maximum power output of five hundred gigajoules. Enterprise was designed to carry three of them. We have one, and it'sonly a prototype. Far be it from me to question the Captain's judgment, butCommander Tucker and I believe we can do this ourselves. And once we get these phase cannons online, we'll have a lot morefirepower to do just that. Er, no. Please. Tell me about it. I haven't set foot outside the Armoury since ohseven hundred. It's fine. I'm sorry? Enchiladas? I appreciate the offer, but it really isn't necessary. No, he's a fine cook. That's very flattering. I'm just not sure it would beappropriate. Well, we work together and it just might be a little awkward,Serving on the same ship. Well, then, it's my mistake then. No, please, finish your dinner. Reed to Bridge. Armoury, report. Get to your stations. Move. Port two or port one? Get it right. Start on those beam emitters. We should be aligning them by now, not installing them. Ow! Yeah, fine. I told them to depolarise these relays! Bypass the grid. Well, we could draw power for the cannons directly from theimpulse engines. The relays were rated to handle that much power. I've thought of that. These inverters were designed to cut in atthe first sign of an overload. I've run a dozen simulations. It's an acceptable risk. Sir, if we do this by the book, those aliens are likely to beback before we're done. Yes, sir. I'm just disconnecting them now. Yes, Commander, I am. In that case, if the Chief Engineer wouldn't mind getting hishands dirty, I could use some help. Captain's starlog, September 1, 2151. It's beentwo days now with no sign of the alien vessel. Yes, Captain. Acquiring the target. Full power to theprimary coils. Phase cannons one and two standing by. Check the cannons. Be careful down there. The blast yield was ten times what we expected. Something overloaded the phase modulators. They're toying with us. They want us to know they can destroy uswhenever they want, even with our own weapons. We see them. Both forward cannons arecharged and ready. Even if these cannons had been installed atJupiter Station, they wouldn't be any more effective than they are now. Yes sir, but that was due to an overload. Sir, after the damage from the first timethe plasma recoil would probably knock out two decks. I believe so. But sir. How? The grav-plating wasn't designed To withstand that much force. Aye, sir. Stand by. Trip? We're ready, sir. Fairly well. I'll have them back online within thehour. The aft cannon should be working by the endof day tomorrow. Hear, hear. Cheers. You shouldn't have gone to any trouble. Pineapple! That's myfavourite. How on Earth did you know?"

Bridge to the Captain. The alien vessel has returned. They dropped out of warp five hundred kilometres dead ahead. We're being scanned. Their doesn't match anything in our database. It was a different time. There were fewer warp-capable species. What are you suggesting? Ensign, if you want to know something about Mister Reed perhapsyou should ask him. {Mess hall} Captain, I'm detecting a ship dead astern. Eight thousand metres. Closing to seven thousand. Six thousand. Warp drive is offline. Main power isdown. Tactical systems are down. The outer doors in Launch Bay two are opening. I can't. The alien vessel has gone to warp, but that last shotdamaged our port nacelle. We're venting drive plasma. No. None that I know of, Captain. There are no Vulcan ships within scanningrange. That's because it isn't there. There's nothing but debris at the co-ordinates where we deployedthe amplifier. Destroyed as well. Yes, Captain. There's nothing there. I'm getting an anomalous reading from Launch Bay two. It's very likely. It's putting out a tremendous amount ofenergy. Over six hundred megajoules. Whatever it is, it's tapped into most of our systems includinginternal sensors and communications on every deck. It's them. Closing from astern, twenty thousand metres. Fifteen. They've stopped. Eleven thousand metres. I'm reading a fluctuation in their shielding, but it's marginal. Their shields are failing. No."
495,ENT,episode 10,TUCKER,"I ate in my quarters. Now that we've got the amplifier workingI wanted to answer a few letters. Damn. Dinner and a show. That is the upgrade. Well if you want, I can change the colour. The usual, engineering updates. Oh, and Duvall got promoted. They're giving him the Shenandoah. And I got a letter from Natalie. Yep. Natalie from Pensacola. Looks like I've got a chargeimbalance in this manifold. I'll get right on it. You know, they say long-distance relationships never work. Well, this is about as long-distance as you can get. Oh, yeah. I just, I just wish I'd have had the chance to saygoodbye face to face. I was in the Armoury yesterday for a few hours swapping outsome power relays. Power relays. Really? Are you kidding? My mom would give you herrecipe for pan-fried catfish, and wouldn't let you go till you promisednot to screw it up. That's strange. That support frame's bent. We'll need toreinforce it. If that last shot had been about a half a metre higher we'd belooking at stars. There were thirteen people working in this section Captain,including yours truly. If that bulkhead had blown. I know we can do it. Most of the stuff we need is already onthe ship. My engineers are just as good as they are. It'll cut down the time we'll have to spend in Spacedock. Our job is to get it up and running and build two more fromscratch. The Captain is taking us back because he thinks this ought tobe done by the boys in Spacedock. That means double shifts. By the time we reach Jupiter Station,I don't want their engineers to have a thing to do but give us a washand a wax. Any questions? We all signed up for this trip because we wanted to dosomething no one had ever done before, not because we thought it'd beeasy or safe. But we're not here to take foolish risks. The Captain andthe rest of the crew are depending on us to keep Enterprise ready foranything. So what are you standing around for? Tucker to Archer. We've got the plasma leak Under control, but our port nacelle took alot of damage. A couple of days. That's the good news. It should be back online in a few minutes. Targeting scanners will be online in an hour. You were a little hard on Eddie. Everyone's busting their tails to get this job done. You okay? What were you trying to do? Why? Are you trying to make this blow up in your face? What if there's a surge? We've got to do this by the book, or we'll end up blowing abigger hole in ourselves than the bad guys. When it comes to modifying ship systems, why don't you let theChief Engineer decide what's an acceptable risk? I want to get this job done as quickly as you do, Lieutenant,but not if it means taking shortcuts that could get our people killed. You know, I can't sleep without the warp engines online. If Idon't feel those vibrations, something just doesn't seem right. Well, with all due respect, Captain, you shouldn't be talking. It'll be online by the end of the day tomorrow, guaranteed. Could you check the dilithium alignment for me? Let me know if it drops below point oh three. Well, the Vulcans would have loved that. Towing the pride ofStarfleet back to base. Keep an eye on it. Sure. I just didn't think I'd be seeing it so soon. Are your ears a little pointier than usual? If we hadn't launched when we did, they'd have sent Klaang backto Kronos in a box. Don't forget Porthos. In the old days, astronauts rode rockets with millions oflitres of hydrogen burning under their seats. You think they said, geeI'd love to go to the moon today but it seems a little risky? I thinkif you asked anyone on board whether they thought this mission wasworth the risk you'd get the same answer from every one of them. Aye, sir. Have you still got those guns of yourshooked up to the impulse engines? Hang on a minute. You're sure this'll work? Then based on the recommendation of the Armoury officer, theChief Engineer finds the level of risk acceptable. The plasma recoil blew out relays acrossdecks C and D. There. What's that? Hold on a minute. I think there's a way to handle the recoil. All that excess energy's got to go somewhere. Why not put it to use? If we repolarise the gravity plating to absorb the recoil, Then we can shunt the energy tostructural integrity. We blew out the plasma relays on B deckbut it's nothing we can't take care of. What about our friends? To our mysterious friends. I wish Icould've seen the looks on their faces. and If you really want to thank us, how about letting us sleep intomorrow?"

What can I do for you? You spend a lot of time in the Mess Hall. Have you ever had ameal with Lieutenant Reed? Many times. Ah, the birthday dinner. Well, the man loves a good breakfast. Eggs, I've seen him eat a lot of eggs. Scrambled, poached, over easy. Oh, and he enjoys pancakes, on occasion. He has the odd habit ofspreading peanut butter on them. Sausage, that's another favourite. Bacon too, come to think of it. Not that I recall. If anything comes to mind, I'll let you know. Medically speaking, there's no accounting for taste. Bromelin! I think I can help you, Ensign, but it would mean going intoMister Reed's medical record. That information is confidential. Under the circumstances, I suppose it wouldn't hurt. I've madeit a point to study each crewman's medical history, and I remembernoticing that Lieutenant Reed suffers from a number of allergies. Let'ssee. Dust mites, oak pollen, tropical grasses. Ah ha ha, here it is. He's averse to various plant enzymes, including bromelin. Over the last several years he's been taking regular injectionsso that his body can tolerate bromelin. Yes.

Try, please. Is that a fish? Thanks. I've talked to his sister, his best friend, his Uncle Archie,his two spinster aunts. The most anyone seems to know about his eatinghabits is that he occasionally eats. Anyone sitting here? This is the first chance I've had to eat all day. How's your ravioli? Nothing like a nice plate of pasta. You know, I used to love tocook but I never get a chance to anymore, and the way that Chefprotects the galley. One of these nights, I should fix somethingmyself. You'd love my enchiladas. If you don't like them, I can fix something else. What's yourfavourite food? Aren't you getting a little tired of having to eat whatever Chefhappens to serve? Don't get me wrong. He's terrific. It's just that dinner in theMess Hall can lack a certain personal touch. I've got a hot plate in myquarters. What do you mean? What does that have to do with? Oh! No,I didn't, I didn't mean to imply anything other than just makingdinner, Lieutenant. No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have. Yeah, I'll just. No, no, no, you've got a lot of work to do, so. I can't raise Vulcan. It's funny. I ran a diagnostic after theattack, but now Echo Two won't respond. Doctor? I see you released your patients. That's good to hear. Many times. Any idea what his favourite food might be? Like what? How does he like them? Maybe Chef could make him a big omelette. Is there any one food in particular? Breaking a Vulcan encryption code would be easier than this. I don't suppose scanning his taste buds would help? Thanks anyways. Sorry? I'm under direct orders from the Captain. Couldn't you make anexception? What does all of this have to do with what he likes to eat? A plant enzyme. Found in? Pineapple! It's close enough. Thank you, Doctor. We're being hailed. At least there's one good thing about coming back this far. Wecan drop another subspace amplifier. Sorry to interrupt, Captain. I have thatcomponent that you asked for.

On most of the planets we've encountered, only one species ofhumanoids survived the evolutionary process. Come in. I've just gotten a call from the director of the clinic. He'seager to hear if you've made any progress. Doctor? What about a cure? But not impossible. Take all the time you need. It was no problem. How are you feeling? We're trying to do something about that. I have a lot of faithin Doctor Phlox. We started out in ships very similar to yours. Someday you'llbe travelling just as fast as we are. You may not find that everyone you meet wants to help you. Archer. I'll meet you at the shuttlepod. Archer out. Anything to report? From whom? Do you have a minute? The Valakians want our warp technology. That I'd think about it. Safe to say I know where you stand on the subject. They have no experience working with antimatter. I doubt theyeven realize how dangerous it is. They're not ready. We could stay and help them. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm beginning to understandhow the Vulcans must have felt. Looks like I'm not the only one. Am I going to be without my doctor this winter? Maybe I'll join you. Any progress? A cure, Doctor. Have you found a cure? Ethical? Every time you treat an illness, you're interfering. That'swhat doctors do. What about the Menk? And that won't happen as long as the Valakians are around. Well, what are you suggesting? We choose one species over theother? The hell with nature. You're a doctor. You have a moralobligation to help people who are suffering. Go ahead. I appreciate your perspective on all of this, but we're talkingabout something that might happen. Might happen thousands of years fromnow. They've asked for our help. I am not prepared to walk away basedon a theory. My compassion guides my judgment. Can you find a cure? Doctor? Doctor. I'm going down to the Valakian hospital. I have reconsidered. I spent the whole night reconsidering, andwhat I've decided goes against all my principles. Someday my people aregoing to come up with some sort of a doctrine, something that tells uswhat we can and can't do out here, should and shouldn't do. But untilsomebody tells me that they've drafted that directive I'm going to haveto remind myself every day that we didn't come out here to play God. Phlox tells me this medicine will helpease the symptoms for a decade, maybe more. A lot can happen in thattime. I wouldn't be surprised if you developed a cure on your own. I'm sorry.

No. We may look alike, but the similarity ends there. That's impossible. My teeth were sealed with a tri-fluorinate compound twenty threeyears ago. I'm sure you have more pressing concerns. I'll comeback later. Are you asking out of personal interest or scientific curiosity? In my experience, humans lack the emotional maturity forinterspecies relationships. They tend to be easily infatuated withthings they find new. This crewman may simply be satisfying hercuriosity at your expense. Be careful. We've received twenty nine hails in the past two hours. Apparently, word of our arrival has spread quickly. Otherclinics are requesting help. Two orbital spacecraft approached us whileyou were on the planet. They mistakenly believed that we already had acure. We had to turn them away. What did you tell them? And?

It's nothing like that. They're from Doctor Lucas. He's acolleague from the Interspecies Medical Exchange. He's the first. He helped me get settled in when I came to SanFrancisco. I'm trying to return the favour. The curiosity of an explorer, even then. Oh, yes. I'm looking forward to it. If you think you're ready,we can tackle gerunds today. Dear Doctor Lucas, sorry to hear aboutyour difficult week. I know the rigours of mating season only too well. It might help to bear in mind that a dose of niaxilin can be quiteeffective in separating the two combatants. It sounds like you'vesettled into your new living quarters. That part of the city has somevery lively Kaybin bars along the river. They're open all night, if I recall. Please, don't ventureinside them unescorted. They can be quite disturbing to theuninitiated. Oh, it's superficial. Only first degreeburns. A little dermoline gel should do the trick. Most of my work is fairly routine. Scrapes and bruises, the occasional emergency. And you'll be pleased tohear that the crew finally seems to be growing accustomed to an aliendoctor on board. I must admit, I wasn't planning to stay this long butthe opportunity to observe your species on their first deep spaceventure has proven irresistible. Lieutenant, I saved a seat for you. It's a bit daunting at times, tryingto socialise with the crew, form friendships, but our professionguarantees that sooner or later everyone comes to see us. It makesinteraction quite a bit easier. It's just a little gastrointestinaldistress. Well, you've been feeding him cheese again, haven't you? You'vegot to learn how to say no, Captain. I never thought I'd meet a species that forges suchintimate bonds with lesser creatures. It's surprising the things youhumans choose to invest your emotions in. No bother. He was one of my more co-operative patients today. I've noticed how the captain seems toanthropomorphise his pet. He even talks to the creature although I'mfairly certain it has no idea what he's saying. Then again, I've beenknown to speak to my Pyrithian bat on occasion. No, no. I'd like to stay and see what happens. No, not the film. I'm sensing a rising emotional undercurrent inthe room. I'm curious to see if it culminates in some kind of groupresponse. We had something similar a few hundred years ago, but they losttheir appeal when people discovered their real lives were moreinteresting. I suppose it is. It's remarkable, Doctor. Evenfictional characters seem to elicit human compassion. My shipmates havecalmly faced any number of dangers, and yet a simple movie can bringtears to their eyes. Temporal vein. And what is the maxillary connected to? Very good. The external jugular. And that leads to? Physiologically, it is nothing more than a very efficient pump. What could possibly make you people think it is the source of allemotion? Good night. You're welcome. I'm sure I will. It's all right. I'm trying to shed some of my culturalinhibitions. Since we were on the subject ofmating, I think Crewman Cutler may be romantically interested in me. Ican't be certain, however. The pheromones of human females aren't aspotent as Denobulans'. I detected the illness. I am. If this letter arrives later thanusual, Doctor, I hope you'll forgive me. I've been presented with arather unusual case involving a pair of alien astronauts. It may notsurprise you that they landed in my Sickbay through an act of humancompassion. I said before that my duties entail the occasionalemergency. Emergencies, it seems, come in all shapes and sizes. I wasonce nearly overwhelmed by fifty patients in a refugee camp on Matalas. Captain Archer is now asking me to take responsibility for over fiftymillion. Their condition is grave, but they're resting fornow. Your syntax is improving. Continue. The sauce is good but I don't care for thisvegetable. It's a nostril? In Denobulan, please. I believe the word you're searching for is dating. I'm not exactly sure. Well, she did kiss me on the cheek the other night. Do you have any advice? I beg your pardon? The Captain has committed all ourresources to helping people he didn't even know existed two days ago. Once again, I am struck by your species' desire to help others. What's the current rate of infection? You're treating them with a syntheticantibody? Captain, treatment with priaxate should ease the symptoms in thesickest patients, at least temporarily. I can easily show the Valakianshow to synthesize as much as they need. I'll need all of the lab work you have, and case histories ofpatients in every stage of the disease. I don't see any Menk patients here. Where are they beingtreated? Have you looked into their immunity? Still, could be significant. I'd like to see your data on theMenk as well. I had meant to transmit this letter bynow but the Valakian epidemic has been taking up most of my time. Working with the physicians here has been quite fulfilling. I supposeit's the reason we joined the Interspecies Medical Exchange, but Iworry about falsely raising their hopes. Despite Captain Archer'sconfidence in me I'm afraid the scale of the disaster may outweigh ourbest intentions. I've decided to enlist Crewman Cutler's help in mytask. You'll have the chance to see for yourself. You're a trainedexobiologist. I'd find your assistance in the field invaluable. On a personal note, the affection Crewman Cutler is showinghas left me a bit perplexed, so I've decided to discuss it with the oneperson on board who might understand the complexities of the situation. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Well, normal wear and tear has allowed some decay to sneak in. See for yourself. There, on your anterior tricuspid. I'm waiting for the computer to analyse some tissue samples. It'll only take a moment to repair. Open,please. Wider. You've lived among humans for quite some time now,Sub-commander. I'm curious, have you ever known them to mate outsidetheir species? Ah! There it is. Both, I suppose. There's a crewman on board I've become closewith. I think she's attracted to me. Open. Sub-commander T'Pol has a very pragmatic feel of theuniverse. I admire her logic although she lacks the instinctivenessthat a more emotional response can provide. Somehow, I find thisunsettling. There. That wasn't so bad. Thanks for your insights. You asked to see me, Captain? I've developed a medication to ease the symptoms of the disease,butARCHER This epidemic isn't being caused by a virus or bacteria. Theproteins that bind to their chromosomes are deteriorating. Theirillness is genetic. It's been going on for thousands of years, but therate of mutation has accelerated over the last few generations. Basedon my projections, the Valakians will be extinct in less than twocenturies. I wish I had better news. Genetic abnormalities on this level are very difficult toreverse. No. I still believe the Menk immunity could be the key to acure. I plan to study them in more detail. When I began to practice medicine Ihad no idea it would take me on journeys to other worlds. Every speciesI encounter allows me to explore a new physiology. At the moment, Ifind myself in the enviable position of studying two humanoids from thesame planet. It's a rare and exciting opportunity. Tell them we'd like to run some tests, take samples of theirblood. It will be completely painless. As fascinating as the two species are from a biologicalstandpoint, it's their ability to co-exist that intrigues me the most. The Valakians are highly evolved, technologically advanced, while theMenk are relatively primitive by comparison. To my surprise, the twoseem to be living side by side, peacefully. Have you learned enough Menk to explain a molecular bio scan? Have you been teaching him English? Perhaps we've found an assistant comm. officer. I haven't seen any crops or livestock. I wonder where they getthis. Despite the Menk's insistence that they're treated well, myhuman crewmates seem to see things differently. They think the Menk are being exploited by the Valakians,so their first instinct is to rise to their defence, despite the factthat the Menk don't appear to need or want a defender. Wait a moment. Impressive. He's grouped the samples together by family. Cross-referenced bybloodlines and marriage if I'm interpreting the colour codes correctly. Tik tik. On the surface the Menk appear to be a primitive species,unsophisticated even by human standards. No offence. But theirabilities appear to have been underestimated, even by myself. What? Why should it? On most worlds with two humanoid species onewould have driven the other to extinction. Here, they've developed asymbiotic relationship that seems to work quite well. Their culture is different. It's their way. Are you married, crewman? I'm married. Three times. I have three current wives and they each have two husbands notcounting myself. Quite. I've been getting certain signals from you that suggest you maybe interested in a romantic relationship with me. Unless I misinterpreted those signals. You need to know that my culture is different. It doesn't? This culture's different. That seems to matter toyou a great deal. What do you mean by friend? It's Phlox, Captain. We've collected all the samples. Trouble sleeping, Captain? Actually, Denobulans require very little rest, unless you countour annual hibernation cycle. Only for six days. The research has been challenging, to say the least. Even if I could find one, I'm not sure it would be ethical. We'd be interfering with an evolutionary process that has beengoing on for thousands of years. You're forgetting about the Menk. I've been studying their genome as well, and I've seen evidenceof increasing intelligence. Motor skills, linguistic abilities. Unlikethe Valakians they appear to be in the process of an evolutionaryawakening. It may take millennia, but the Menk have the potential tobecome the dominant species on this planet. If the Menk are to flourish, they need an opportunity to surviveon their own. All I'm saying is that we let nature make the choice. I'm also a scientist, and I'm obligated to consider the largerissues. Thirty five thousand years ago, your species co-existed withother humanoids. Isn't that correct? What if an alien race had interfered and given the Neanderthalsan evolutionary advantage? Fortunately for you, they didn't. Evolution is more than a theory. It is a fundamental scientificprinciple. Forgive me for saying so, but I believe your compassion forthese people is affecting your judgment. Captain. I already have. Two days ago, when we first discoveredthe alien shuttle, I had no idea that I'd be facing a dilemma of thismagnitude. For the first time, I find myself in conflict with myCaptain. But he is my Captain and he's placed a great deal of trust inme. I believe I owe him the same. I only hope that he is willing tolook beyond his sympathy for these poor people. Captain. Sir, it would go against all my principles if I didn't ask youto reconsider what I I'd like to think, Doctor Lucas, thatif I'd had the chance to talk to you face to face you'd have never letme even consider withholding my findings from the Captain. But I'mashamed to say that I almost did just that. If I hadn't trusted him to make theright choice I'd have been no better than the Vulcan diplomats who heldyour species back because they felt you couldn't make proper decisionson your own. I came very close tomisjudging Jonathan Archer, but this incident has helped me gain a newrespect for him. Happiness and health to you, Doctor. Your dedicatedcolleague, Phlox. Please. For Doctor Lucas. Fine, fine. The past few days have been taxing. Yes. Perhaps you're right. Good night. Phlox to Crewman Cutler. I, er, know it's short notice, but I was wondering if you mightlike to join me for a little snack in the Mess hall. I could use afriend right about now. Thank you. Sweet dreams. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

I had a pen pal once when I was twelve, from Brisbane,Australia, and I loved getting her letters. It was like this littlewindow into distant places with strange sounding names. Are we still on for later? I can hardly wait. The ship's not answering our hails, Captain. I need a little more. How are your patients? I'm sure you'll find a way to help them. Do you like the food? Eggplant's not a vegetable, it's a nostril. A fruit. I've noticed you andCrewman Cutler spending a lot of time together. Is there somethinggoing on between you two? Are you two mating? Well, are you? Well, are you? There are ways you can tell. Does she want tospend time with you? Does she find excuses to to makephysical contact? In Denobulan, Doctor. I think you make a very cute washboard. Couple. A cute couple. Excuse me. We're the ones that brought him here. Can you tell mehow he's doing? I'm sorry. Could you say that again? Captain, the UT can't translate his language. He doesn't speak the same language as you? Kuhl toh bah. He's says they'd be happy to help. Pra du matta. He wants to know what you're doing. Doctor, er, esatta prah koo kuvalakii. I told him the Doctor was looking inside of him. Tik tik. You're welcome. No, he must have picked it up by listening to us. Tik tik. Larr, ku rasata gol dach? He says the soil here isn't good for planting. The Valakians don't let them live where the land is fertile. The Valakians give them whatever they need. Food, clothing,medicine. He says the Valakians are good to them. They protect them. I'm going to help Larr finish packing up. He's back on duty atthe hospital in an hour. You wanted to see me? It'll go out first thing in the morning. Everything all right? Want my advice? Get out of Sickbay. Good night."

It was fun tonight. Er, they're showing another one next week. Sunset Boulevard. Ithink you might like it. See you tomorrow? Oh, sorry. Iforgot Denobulans don't like to be touched. Oh, in that case. Good night. So whatare the Menk like? Thank you, Doctor. What'd you say? Thank you. Did he just say food? Tik tik. Well, that's the last one. What'd he do? It seems like a vacation, if I didn't keep remembering why wewere here. This really doesn't bother you. The way the Valakians treat them. They force the Menk to live in compounds. They treat themalmost like pets. Doesn't make it right. Of course not. I would have told you. You are? So, you have two ex-wives? Is that considered normal for Denobulans? Why are you telling me this? Oh. You didn't. But I still don't know why you're telling me this. That doesn't matter. Phlox, as far as your extended family goes I'm not interestedin becoming wife number four. I just want to be your friend. Let's just see where it goes. Go ahead. Ten minutes?"

Dukat ah pra kee, Larr. No, he's Menk. They're not as evolved as Valakians but they'revery hard workers. Is that so strange? You two are not from the same planet? They haven't contracted the disease.

What's on your mind? They have their UTs, and we'll try to keep an open comlink. Are you trying to tell me something? I never doubted that you'd find them. Your timing couldn't bebetter. T'Pol just asked me to assign you to the team. You'd better getto the launch bay before they leave without you. How many are there? You can't tell what happened to them? Stand by. How long is the pod's hull going to hold up? T'Pol. You've got twenty minutes to see if you can do anything forthat crew, then I want you out of there. Understood? You have a margin of safety. Archer to T'Pol. What's your status? Shuttlepod One, respond. Sounds like Klingon. Set a pursuit course. Bring the grappler online. Bridge to Security. Send a team to launch bay one. Trip. Thebridge is yours, Travis. Everybody all right? Archer to the Bridge. Have you still got a fix on the shipwreck? Transfer the coordinates to the launch bay. I'm going back forthe boarding party. Then polarise the hull plating. We'll take Enterprise down. Archer to boarding party. Come in. How are you holding up? What's your status? Don't worry about it. We're coming to get you. Travis, how much farther? Is our probe still working? Try using it to triangulate their position. I'm afraid we've got a little hitch in our rescue plan. We'll be back for you as soon as we can. In the meantime, just sit tight. Can you do anything? I'm the Captain. From what I've noticed, that's not hard to do. You strandedthree of my people down there. We didn't infect anyone. We boarded your ship to try and help. Look, I don't know what happened to your crew but we hadnothing to do with it. Now your vessel is sinking deeper into theatmosphere and unless we do something, it'll be destroyed. I've got three very capable people on your ship. Let them help. If you tell them how to get the engines running, they can fly it out ofthere. No. Remind me to stop trying to help people. How long will it last down there? I don't think we're going to get any help from our guest inSickbay. Get started on those braces. Keep an eye out forany Klingon ships coming this way. I think I might havemade a tactical error dealing with the Klingon woman. I asked her forhelp. She could see that as a sign of weakness. We've run into them three times, and every time they've wantedto destroy us. I'd love to figure out why. That may not be so easy. We could use their help right now. Ifwe can re-establish a comm. signal with T'Pol and the others, theKlingon woman could probably talk them through the repairs, but she'sgot a thousand generations of instinct telling her not to trust me. Go ahead. Qapla'. Success. I decided to take your advice about thinking like aKlingon. The Vulcan database has about nine hundred pages on them. Plenty. They're driven by a warrior mentality. They tend toview anyone they meet as a potential enemy. They also have a strong sense of duty. Er, Heh CHo' mruak tah. Death before dishonour. Finish up that diagnostic. I'll be in Sickbay. Something like that. Doctor Phlox has developed an antidote to the neurotoxin inyour system. Have you had a drink lately? The bio-agent that affected you and your crew was consumed,apparently in alcohol. Yes? I can understand your not wanting to talk about it, if theraid went badly for you. Did your whole crew drink it? I'll take that as a yes. It was that ale that infected you, notus. Think about it. When did your crew start getting sick? Was it rightafter the raid? After you celebrated your victory? Is it? How do you feel? Better or worse since the injection? Wecan make enough of this for your entire crew, if it's not too late. What if this isn't a trick? What if we're telling you the truth? You'dbe letting your crew die a very dishonourable death when you could havesaved them. Can you live with that? Sensor resolution'sdropping off. That's how we found it the first time. Weapons fire. Bearing two nine seven mark two six one, down about twokilometres. Another explosion. There's a shock wave this time. Hang on. What have you been shooting at? I brought someone who should be able tohelp do just that. We're docking now. I believe you've all met Officer Bu'kaH. What's the status of their engines? I didn't bring you down here just so you could die with yourshipmates. My crew risked their lives to get this ship out of danger. Idon't intend to leave until the job is finished. This is Klingon Raptor Somraw, hailingEnterprise. Request permission to disembark four passengers. Thanks. Get ready to break orbit, Travis. I think we've hadabout enough of this place. I doubt it. Put it through. What can I do for you? Maybe your engineer neglected to tell you, but we just savedyou and your crew. It was either that or stand by and watch you get crushed. You wouldn't last ten seconds in a battle with us. You've gotmultiple hull breaches, your shields are down, and from what I'm toldyou're fresh out of torpedoes. If I were you, I'd take what littlehonour I had left and go home. Fire one shot and I'll blast you rightback to where we found you. Get us out of here before their friends show up."

If those hadbeen live rounds, you'd have blown out two or three bulkheads. This is an entirely new weapon. Unlike the EM-33 you don't haveto compensate for particle drift. Just point straight at the target,and try and keep your shoulders relaxed. It's hard to aim accuratelywhen you're tense. Ahem. Yeah, fine. You'll get the hang of it. Let's try for twentyseconds this time. We're approaching a gas giant. Class nine. We'll pick it up tomorrow. We can travelfaster than the speed of light. You'd think we could find a cure forthe common cold. I don't see how I could actually catch a cold on a hermeticallysealed starship. I did open a case of plasma coolant. But that was back in Spacedock five months ago. No, that'll have to wait. The Captain wants me on the teaminvestigating that shipwreck. I'll do my best. Trust me, Ensign. If there's a hull breach the pressure willcrush you to something about this big. It's one hundredkilometres below us, still descending. That's well within our hull tolerance. We'll be on our way back well before we're in any danger. I forone have no interest in imploding a valuable shuttlepod. I see it. It's just the proximity alarm. What is it? No. This damn cold. What language? So I'm assuming you don't know how many Klingons are on board. And what if they don't? The atmosphere's going to crush this shiplike an eggshell pretty soon. Well, I for one don't intend to just fly off and let these peopledie, honourable deaths or not. Damn interference. There must be something we can do. Maybe they have adistress beacon we can activate. There's got to be some way off this ship. I don't know about the structural integrity of Klingon escapepods. My guess is we're better off in here. I haven't had much experience at piloting Klingon ships. We could always try waking one of them to help us. Photon torpedoes? I've never heard of anything like that. Whatelse? If I'm reading this correctly we've got a few hours at most. Thehull integrity's failing. Good work, Hoshi. Hoshi? To quote our very own Mister Tucker, that means we're dead in thewater. The one time we need our Chief Engineer is the one time we leavehim behind. Sounds like we need to find the port fusion injector. Reactor pit? Could that be Engineering? This one? Argh! Yes. I seem to be getting a little light-headed. Must be theheat. Watch yourselves. The hull pressure's approaching critical. This ship's about to be crushed. It'll work. Look, even with Hoshi's help it could take hours just to find thefusion injector in here. We're out of time. If there's one thing on board this ship I ought to be able tofigure out, it's the torpedoes. We'll need to detonate one closer next time. And if I don't? We need to generate a large enough shock wave topush us into a higher orbit. To do that, the blast has to be big and ithas to be close. You heard the Sub-Commander. Load twothis time. Did it work? That's all? This whole damn ship's coming apart. How many torpedoes do wehave left? Load two more. Load the weapons. Ensign. The longer we stand around arguing the more ground we lose. We'll detonate at eight hundred metres. Brace yourselves. We used the shock waves to gain some altitude but it's onlytemporary. We'll start sinking again unless we can come up with a wayto get this ship out of here. Is someone going to get that? Are you sure, Doctor? Who knows what was living on that ship? That should buy us at least another half an hour. Went to a spa once in Mexico. The most relaxing place I've everbeen, but it doesn't compare to this. Oh, it certainly feels nice to beclean again."

646,ENT,episode 12,T'POL,"The probe's entered the outer atmosphere. Intense magnetic fields often create unique waveforms. Other than keeping Ensign Mayweather up at night, I'm not surewhat we expect to accomplish here. There are four gas giants in yourown solar system. I'm reading an anomalous power signature in the loweratmosphere, and several biosigns. I thought you were acquainted with theenvironmental suit. I requested you for your skills as a translator, but if you'reuncomfortable. Gravity's pulling it deeper into the atmosphere. At theircurrent altitude the pressure is fifteen thousand gsc. For the moment. But at the rate that vessel is sinking, we'llhave an hour at most. I'm merely stating facts. We've entered an eddy of liquid helium. We're clear. One hundred metres. Fifty metres. Forty. Twenty metres. Ten. Engaging docking interface. Nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Carbon dioxidelevels are high, but nothing's toxic. It's breathable. There are many classes of ships. I'm not familiar with all ofthem. I'm reading three biosigns. That way. All very weak. They're still alive. We should leave beforethey regain consciousness. They don't want our help. They're Klingons. To die at their post assures them a path tothe afterlife. If we rescue them, they'd be dishonoured. Your compassion is admirable but misguided. If they awake andfind us on their ship, they'll kill us. Three on the bridge, but I'm detecting at least nine morebiosigns on board. I'm detecting residual amounts of ancarbon dioxide based neurotoxin, but it seems to have dissipated. There's not enough to affect us. Yes, Captain. I don't believe there's anything we can do in twenty minutes. Isuggest we leave now. Captain? T'Pol to Enterprise. Or we've dropped out of comm. range. It doesn't make sense to place ourselves at risk whenthey'd rather die. I doubt you'll find one. Klingons don't call for help. And if they wake up on the trip back to Enterprise? It's our shuttlepod taking off. It's irrelevant, Lieutenant. Klingons don't use escape pods. Itwould be considered an act of cowardice to abandon ship. I doubt their comm. will penetrate the EM field any better thanour own. If we can access their helm controls we might be able to putthis vessel into a stable orbit. We have no other choice. Start translating those consoles. Look for anything marked propulsion,helm, navigation. You're certain? What about this one? Or hull? Then we'd better hurry. This appears to be the helm station. We've been attempting to restart theirengines, but they appear to be offline. You're dehydrated. You need some water. You shouldn't go alone. It's called gagh. It's a Klingon delicacy, but only when they'realive. They are worms. Targs. Klingons prefer their food freshly slaughtered. Are youall right? You're in a dangerous situation in an alien environment. Youranxiety is understandable. You can't deny your nature. Take my hand. My hand. Close your eyes. Think of yourself on a turbulent ocean. Youhave the power to control the waves. Focus. The waves are subsiding. The wateris growing still. You're in control. When we return to the ship, I'll teach you how to do it on yourown. Lieutenant Reed, report. If you're wrong, you could destroy the ship. How do you know you can even access the tactical systems? The shock wave dissipated before it reached us. The ship's hull is under enough pressure already. If youdetonate a torpedo too close. She's right. We'll never reach a safe altitude climbing a fewhundred metres at a time. We may gain enough altitude, but I doubt we'd make it in onepiece. T'Pol. The Klingon crew made most of the necessary repairs before theywere overcome, but the port fusion injector is still damaged. T'Pol. Maybe you should run them again, Doctor. I believe I'mdeveloping a slight headache. Thank you, Doctor. It is pleasant. I don't smell anything."

Barely. The probe's gone. T'Pol said the Klingons were unconscious. Why is this one solively? You know, I read if they sense a leader's weak, they'll try tokill him and take command. Yeah, it's a tough little ship but it can't hold up under thatpressure forever. What if we use duratanium braces to reinforce ashuttlepod? It won't look pretty but, it might hold up long enough forus to get our people out. You been boning up on your Klingon psychology? Well, maybe the bestthing is just to steer clear of them. Maybe it's time you started thinking like a Klingon. I'd like to run one more structuraldiagnostic before you launch. Beg your pardon? Learn anything? That may explain why our guest is so irritable. Going to go put your homework to use? How long till they get here? On screen. Well, I don't see why not. I kept your seat warm for you. Calling to say thanks? They're charging weapons."

Oh, you may have picked up the virus from a piece of equipment. It could have been lurking inside a sealed container. Whoever packed that case was probably nursing a cold. You underestimate the tenacity of a virus, Lieutenant. It canlay dormant for months, adapt to whatever environment it finds itselfin. This should ease the symptoms. But the only cureI know of involves bed rest. Well, you won't be contagious inside an environment suit. Justtry not to sneeze in your helmet. T'Pol was right. There's a neurotoxin in her bloodstream. Untreated, it could kill her within a day or two. I'm working on it. She's showing the effects of hypothermia. My guess is she tookrefuge in a low temperature environment aboard her ship. The cold wouldhave delayed the effects of the toxin. Sickbay to Captain Archer. You'll be pleased to know I'vedeveloped an antitoxin. There's an interesting wrinkle, though. Whenyou have a moment I'd like to share it with you. Please relax. If youstrain against the straps you might hurt yourself. Specifically, the toxin was bonded to a molecule unique toXarantine ale.

I'm trying, sir. There's a lot of EM interference. It soundsvery strange. Do you have a minute, sir? That shipwreck. We have no idea what type of life forms we'llfind on that alien vessel, and there's a lot of interference in theatmosphere. Are you sure the away team won't need a translator? What about the language on the control panels, the hatches? Theymight need someone to help them find their way around. I realise that I haven't always been the first one in line tovolunteer for this type of mission, but I want you to know that I amprepared to go. Took a while, but I think I finally got my space legs. Aye, sir. I am. I'm just brushing up on the backup systems. I wouldn'twant the emergency oxygen to fail during a hull breach. I'm perfectly comfortable. I used to find the suits a littleclaustrophobic, but I'm getting used to them. I'll see you in theshuttlepod. You sound uncomfortable, Sub-Commander. Or three valuable officers. That wasn't so bad. Is that a hatch on the port side? What's that? You first. Perhaps we should leave the helmets on. You can't smell that? Count your blessings. You two mightwant to take a look at this. It says deck two,red sector. Klingon. I thought you knewKlingon ships. Why didn't you recognise this one from the outside? How weak? Shouldn't we try to help them? How do you know? We still have twenty minutes. What if we carry some of them into the pod? We could save threeor four. What's that? What about escape pods? Maybe we can use their comm. system to contact Enterprise. I'll try, but reading Klingon is a lot different than speakingit. All right. Kolat chack tabak. Plasmacontainment, maybe. Containment. I'm certain. Pu'DaH dak cha. Something they call photon torpedoes. Well, this all looks like weapons systems. Torpedoes, tacticalsensors, disruptor arrays. I recognise pressure. Ka'tahl. That can mean wall or barrier. Maybe. I think you're right. Quee nagah. Impulse drive. It says the pressure's failing in the J'khat bah. Fusionmanifold. Do you know what that means? We read you, Captain. We're doing okay, sir. It's nice to hear your voice. Captain, you're breaking up. Captain? Come look at this. Wait, I saw that somewhere. Here. One deck below us. It's in thereactor pit. Could be. No. That says something about plasma induction. Here it is. Portfusion injector. Are you okay? I saw a galley on the schematics. Deck four, blue sector. I'llsee what I can find. They look like worms. Ugh! I promised myself I wouldn't dothis. Don't you mean, for a human? This may sound strange but I envy you sometimes. I know, anotherpesky human emotion, but there are times I wish I could just ignore myfeelings. Bury them the way Vulcans do. Excuse me? Whatever it is you're trying to do, it's not working. That was amazing. Thanks. I say we try the weapons. One thousand metres. Two thousand. Three thousand. No effect! We're still sinking. We've moved up, but only two hundred metres. A compartment just collapsed. Deckthree, green sector. Six. It won't be enough. We already tried. It didn't work. Fire them all. What if we detonated all the torpedoes at once? I don't know about you but I'm willing to take the chance. I was thinking more like five hundred. Look, I didn't come allthis way to get crushed in the atmosphere of some anonymous gas giant. Loading ports one through six. Torpedoes armed. You're closer. What if we picked up something your scans can't detect? Oh, I could stay in here all day. Do you smell that?

715,ENT,episode 13,ARCHER,"I found a new system in the Vulcan database. Coridan. They'reonly a few light years away so I thought we'd take a look. Just over three billion humanoids. Apparently, the Vulcans havea mining agreement with them. I had Hoshi send a message to theirChancellor and she invited us to visit their capital city. I think I'll just take Hoshi, this time. The Chancellor askedme to limit the number of people I bring down until they get to know usbetter. It's really too bad. According to the database, they've got thelargest starship construction yards in the sector. They're supposed tohave ships that can run circles around the Vulcans. They say some Coridan ships have reached warp seven, but that'sjust a rumour. You should lend Hoshi your camera. I'll be sure she takes lotsof pictures. You're just too easy a target. Go ahead. Was anyone killed? How are the Vulcans taking this? I can't really blame the Andorians for reacting this way. If the roles were reversed the Vulcans might have done the samething. That's the same crap the Vulcans used to say about us. I understand. Come in. Have a seat. I just spoke with AdmiralForrest. There's no easy way to say this. The Andorians destroyed thesanctuary at P'Jem. Fortunately, the monks and the intelligence operatives weregiven advance warning. They're fine. I don't know. The High Command believes we're to blame forthis. They're sending a ship to take you back to Vulcan. It'll be herein two days. Maybe I wasn't clear. This isn't a temporary transfer. They'rereassigning you. Am I the only one who has a problem with this? Because you seemperfectly fine. The High Command is looking for a scapegoat, someone to blame. They can't punish me so they're taking it out on my science officer. Sounds like an emotional reaction, if you ask me. Don't give yourself too much credit. I was the one who foundP'Jem in the database, and I led the landing party. I want you to knowI'm filing a protest with the High Command. You don't know that. They have no right to do this to you. You're a part of my crew. No. Sorry, Trip, but I've got to take T'Pol on this one. I need tospend some time with her alone. T'Pol's being transferred. A Vulcan ship's on its way to takeher back. Meet me for lunch. I'll fill you in. So, what do you know about Coridan? I wasn't asking for the statistics. Your people have beencoming here for decades. You must know something about their culture,the kinds of food they eat, what they do for fun. Of course not. These people have never seen humans before. It makes sense forsomeone with a familiar face to make the introductions. Don't worry, I'll get you back in plenty of time. I justthought you might enjoy one final mission with your Captain. Or maybe Ishould just take you back to Enterprise. Go ahead, Trip. I got it. Did the Chancellor say anything about sending an escort? I'm taking evasive action. Bring the plasma weapons online. Fire. Houdini could get out of this. Harry Houdini was a magician, an escape artist. He was famousfor being able to free himself from any kind of restraint. Rope,chains, anything. That's why he was called a magician. Some people say he wasdouble-jointed. I don't suppose Vulcans are double-jointed. If you want answers, talk to me. That's right. I'm human, from the planet Earth. There's been a misunderstanding. We're here at the invitationof your Chancellor. It's a phase pistol. Our protein resequencer can make chicken sandwiches. A steward? Ready? Go. Easy. Come on. Go. I think we got a little higher thattime. That's not frustration I hear in your voice. Good. Let's try it again. One, two, three. Ready? Go. I think these are starting tocome loose. How about yours? We might be able to untie these knots. You'd think the Vulcandatabase might have mentioned these people were fighting a civil war. I imagine your people are going to want their database back,too. Well, they can have it. Can youreach the knot? You're not responsible for what happened. You didn't have anyidea that your people had installed a listening post, or that therewere Andorian commandos there. I think I understand. You're running away because you're afraidto become one of us. Then why aren't you fighting this transfer? Your people took something away from my father that meant alot to him. They're not going to do the same thing to me. Go get hisweapon. We can't eat like this. Friendly. Can you pick up yours? Dig in,Sub-commander. I don't think you'll be able to send this back for someplomeek broth. I didn't ask if you were hungry. You need to keep up yourstrength, so eat. That's an order. Look atthis. Trip? Just the two of you? He couldn't have picked a better time. That won't be a problem. Get down. What's going on? Tucker unties Archer while Shran frees T'Pol.)TUCKER Thanks. Seems you went to a lot of trouble to return it. Look, we're all on the same side here. Let's get her to the ship. She's still my Science Officer. Is the podclose? Let's go. I know how you must feel. She saved my life once too. She canbe a real pain in the ass. Stubborn, arrogant. Sometimes she makes meangry enough, I want to shove her out an airlock. I can understand whythe High Command's upset, but it took a lot of courage to step in frontof that plasma bullet. Do you really want to take her back home indisgrace? I'm not asking anyone to pin a medal on her. All I'm asking isthat she be given a second chance. If a respected Vulcan captain wentbefore the High Command and made a plea on T'Pol's behalf, told themhow she saved the life of a superior officer, wouldn't they think twiceabout this transfer? Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You were shot. Don't you remember? He's all right, thanks to you. You made quite an impression on Sopek. I've got a feeling he'sgoing to talk to the High Command about that transfer order. I'd saythe odds are pretty good you're going to be with us for a while longer.

726,ENT,episode 13,T'POL,"Were there any survivors? Was there time to remove any of the relics? I won't have time to complete my scans of this sector. I'll askEnsign Mayweather to finish them. I understand the situation, Captain. I'm certain the HighCommand will find you a suitable replacement. My assignment to the Enterprise was only supposed to last eightdays. It was unrealistic to expect it to continue indefinitely. I am largely responsible for what happened. That won't make any difference. Captain, I was assigned to Enterprise not simply as an observer,but to represent the interests of the Vulcan people. It's clear in theeyes of my superiors I haven't done that. For another forty eight hours. Was there anything else? I haven't received another assignment. My superiors believe that I'm responsible for the destruction ofthe P'Jem sanctuary. It's the logical conclusion. Pride is a human indulgence. There are three billion inhabitants, mostly concentrated inseveral cities in the equatorial region. The Vulcan database doesn't contain that information. I am uncertain why I was chosen for this mission. I have a lot of work to complete before the Vulcan ship arrives. We're only a few minutes from the capital. Returning to the shipnow would be a waste of fuel. Some kind of fixed wing aircraft. I don't think they're an escort. Ready. Perhaps you should invite him on your next mission. That seems unlikely. Unfortunately not. Stop! He's not a tactical officer. He's the ship's steward. We're here to prepare a banquet for your Chancellor. Perhaps. Yes. Only a few centimetres. No. Yes. Slightly. If we can turn around, face each other. The database is accurate. The Coridan government doesn't viewthis as a civil war. I believe so. Without the database you wouldn't have found thisplanet, or P'Jem. Enterprise had no good reason to visit a Vulcan sanctuary. I hadthe opportunity to protest but I chose not to. It's clear that living among humans has caused my reasoning tobecome compromised. I am not running away. No. I'm not hungry. What happened? Captain Sopek? I'd like to return to my quarters. You should have consulted me first. That won't be possible. Leaving Sickbay would violate mydoctor's orders. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

You never would have found that spy stationwithout his help. How'd you get this level of detail? It is if you get the Captain killed. You're outnumbered four toone. Wouldn't you like to improve those odds? Captain, can you hear me? It's me and Malcolm, sir. We're about half a kilometreaway. Not exactly. We met up with some old friends down here. Andorians. Apparently, one of them thinks he owes you a favour. One of the people guarding you is working with them. Whenhe unties you, head for the gate. It's about twenty metres from thebuilding you're in.

Perhaps if you'dbeen a little more open with us, this tragedy might have been avoided. The Vulcan Consulate doesn't make command assignments here. Get me Captain Archer. The Andorians gave the monks three hours beforethey started their bombardment. Fortunately, they all got out in time. Not well. Jon. The Vulcans may have good reason for keeping aneye on them. I've seen the reports. These Andorian commandos are adangerous group. Jon, you're doing a lot of good work, but you'vegot to be more careful.

Since the situation involves a Vulcan officer,we will take over the investigation. It would be best if you refrainedfrom any foolish endeavours. Your vessel is ill-equipped to mount arescue mission. You would most likely become captives yourselves. Myteam will penetrate their base of operations. We've dealt with this sort of threat in the past. Swift,decisive action is the logical response. They've threatened the life of a Vulcan officer. We mustdiscourage any such incidents in the future. I've already been in contact with the Chancellor. She's given mefull authority to implement this action. It is not Vulcan policy to negotiate with terrorists. Any data you may have on the location of your Captain and theSub-Commander would be useful. This is Sopek. Where's Commander Tucker? I want to know where that shuttlepod was going. The one that left your launch bay nine minutesago. I want to know where Commander Tucker is. Your presence here is a violation of theTau Ceti Accords. Put down your weapons! She's no longer your responsibility. We'll treat her on theNi'Var. How is she? Will she live? Nothing can excuse what she did at the sanctuary. I can't return without her.

Well, with our sensor array down, we won't know when they getback until we see them. Any luck with the comm? Well, no doubt you'll have your boys take this pod apart piece bypiece once it's back in the launch bay. Well, tinker all you like. I've got a copy of Ulysses here. Idoubt I'll even be halfway through it by the time the ship gets back. British schools have a core curriculum. It serves to provide awell-rounded education. Sometimes I think you North Americans readnothing but comic books and those ridiculous science fiction novels. Oh, if only Doctor Cochrane had been a European. The Vulcanswould have been far less reticent to help us. But, no, he had to befrom Montana. He probably spent his nights reading about cowboys andIndians. Commander. Commander. I think you'd better come and take a look at this. Is it a ship? They'd be here. They only go three hundred kph. They'd be righthere waiting for us to return. Commander, we have to figure out what we're going to do. With what? We have no radio. Nothing to pick up the beacons. It's offline. Ten million kilometers, maybe twenty, but I highly doubt there'dbe a ship anywhere close to that. At impulse? A lot more than ten days. I'm afraid the math doesn't work out, Commander. It's going totake weeks, maybe months for our signal to reach Echo Three. By thetime Starfleet got a ship out here we'd be, we'd be long dead. Sir. Which way to what? I told you, it's too far. Navigation is down. You want me to guess? Sir. I don't suppose you have a sextant handy. That blue giant, we may have gone by it. I'm not sure. Personal log, Lieutenant Malcolm Reed. November 9, 2151. By thetime anyone hears this, by anyone, I suppose I mean anyone human,Commander Tucker and I will be long dead. It's my intention to recountthe events that led to the destruction of the Starship Enterprise andto express my deepest feelings regarding my short but memorable servicewith Starfleet. short but memorable service withStarfleet. In order to test the targeting scannerson Shuttlepod one, Commander Tucker and I had to get at least twentythousand kilometres from Enterprise. During our third trial, weexperienced a brief but sizable jolt, and shortly thereafter realisedthat our sensor array had gone offline. that our sensor array had gone offline. Wehad no choice but to head back to the asteroid field where Enterprisewas involved in a mapping project. We found the ship destroyed, itsdebris strewn across a square kilometre of one of the larger asteroids. Had our sensors been working we certainly would have done everythingpossible to determine the cause of the disaster, but as it was, withonly a short-range distress beacon and limited air, we had noalternative but to set a course for Echo Three where someday thisvessel and eventually this log, will be found. May God have mercy onour souls. What would you like me to do? If there's something you need me to do I would be more than happyto comply, but I'm afraid pessimism is simply not an accuratedescription of my log entry. I'm just being realistic, Commander. At warp, perhaps, but at impulse? But that's just it, sir. At impulse, we're not likely to berunning into any planets. Not for at least six or seven years. I'll heat up some rations. Unless of course you'd rather waituntil we run into a vessel serving proper meals. What are you in themood for? Veal marsala. Chilean sea bass. Moo Goo Gai Pan. With gravy and mashed potatoes. Kentucky bourbon. The sea bass. It's lovely. Thank you. Captain Archer claims you told him you weren't even aware that Iwas serving on Enterprise. I find that difficult to believe,considering I wrote you twice in the weeks prior to our departure. Now,it is possible that you never received those letters. You were, Ibelieve, in the process of moving back to Malaysia at the time. But youmust have spoken to Aunt Sherry during that period, and I know shereceived my letters. I would hate to go to my death thinking thateither of you felt I was trying to avoidTUCKER As I'm sure you must have heard that was my esteemed colleague,Commander Charles Tucker. Mister Tucker doesn't share my belief that itis essential to say what must be said, to leave a record, tie up looseends. Mister Tucker is labouring under the false hope that we are goingto be miraculously rescued before we both suffocate. In a few days, when the reality of this situation actually beginsto sink in, you might very well decide you want to record some logs ofyour own. You have my word, I will not interrupt you. We have less than nine days of oxygen left. It seems a waste touse it up sleeping. We're back. What happened? How did we? I'm afraid I don't understand. Sub-Commander? I'd feel a lot better if I knew what was going on. Heroics? Well, since you're obviously not going to tell me what happened Isuppose a simple good night will have to do. I can't say I've ever ignored you, T'Pol. Is it all right if Icall you T'Pol? I suppose so. But, if the truth be known, I've never much caredfor the name Malcolm. Always seemed a bit too stuffy. Well, then, perhaps I won't change it. Pity, though. I was rathergrowing fond of the name Stinky. I can't believe you just did that. You smiled. I saw you smile. This one does. I saw you. You're mistaken. It was when I said Stinky, wasn't it? You smiled when I saidStinky. Good morning, Stinky. It's a lovely day,` isn't it, Stinky? What's that? I beg your pardon? You repaired the receiver. What is that? Is it a ship? What the hell was that? We're losing atmosphere. Pressure's down eight percent. Without sensors it's not going to be easy to locate the breach. Pressure's down twenty two percent. Where is it? What are youdoing? I got it. It's overhere. We've got some valve sealant in storage bin three. Do you mind passing your meat loaf? I assume you've finished with it. I'm afraid it did more than just puncturethe cabin, Commander. On it's way out it was kind enough to rupture oneof the O2 cylinders. We've got less than two days of air left. The skin of this pod is designed to deflect a meteor five timesthe size of this hole. We'll never know. We have forty hours of air left. What do you expect me to do, sithere and plan my wedding? Then maybe it's your wedding we should be planning. That'sassuming we can find you a bride in the next day and a half. Anysuggestions? The 602 Club. I was there more times than I can remember. Ruby? You don't mean the waitress Ruby? I knew her more times than I can remember. Seems we have more in common than we thought. What are you talking about? Our last two and a half days freezing versus our last two daystoasty warm. What a delightful choice. Freezing it is then. An officer at his best is always well-groomed. Actually, I was thinking about what our corpses would look likewhen they're eventually found. With no air in the pod, we should remainin fairly good condition. What's that? Thanks. My dearest Deborah. By this time I'm certain you've learned ofthe tragedy that befell the starship Enterprise. You've alsoundoubtedly learned that my colleague, Commander Charles Tucker, and Idid manage to survive for a few days after the accident. It's duringthat brief time that I've chosen to correspond with you. Although ourrelationship was short-lived, and at times tumultuous, I can't help butpicture your beautiful smile. It gives me great comfort. Think of mefrom time to time. Cordially, Malcolm. A ship? My dearest Rochelle. By this time I'm certain you've learned ofthe tragedy That's not true. There have been subtle differences. I wouldnever refer to Rochelle as having a beautiful smile. With her, it wasthe eyes. If the Captain were here with us now I wonder if he'd feel guiltyabout bringing them on this mission. I don't remember Hoshi loving much about being in deep space. Sounds to me like you do have some letters to record. You know, your treacly optimism is beginning to get just a littlebit tiresome. At least I'm capable of accepting our fate. We're going to bedead in about thirty three33 hours. Whether our beards continue to growor not is of no concern to me. We will be dead! And unless some shiphappens to cross our path, our bearded bodies will be discovered inabout three or four years. Is that optimistic enough for you? What's your problem with facing the truth? I'm not hungry. I don't drink on duty. Do you really think that's going to provide any heat? You know that's going to consume oxygen, don't you? Is that really how you see me? The eternal pessimist? The grimreaper? I don't want to die. What makes you think I want to die? I lost nearly everyone I cared about on that ship. Those girls Italked about. Rochelle, Deborah, Catelin. None of them worked outbecause I could never get very close to them. Never got very close tomy family either, for that matter, not that it's any business of yours. But with the crew of the Enterprise, it was different. I was reallystarting to feel comfortable with them, and now the only one that'sleft thinks I'm the bloody angel of death. Does that sound modulated enough for you? The radio. Or is it just the galaxy giggling at us again? Clear my mask? The Captain? I can't imagine why you'd have a problem with that. And who was that? A moray eel? Are you out of your mind. So? That must have been the last time the Captain ever went divingwith you. Hey, what do you think of T'Pol, hmm? Do youthink she's pretty? Well, she's a woman, you know? I think she's pretty. Don't tell me you've never looked at her, you know, in that way. Well, I think she's pretty. You ever noticed her bum? Her bum. She's got an awfully nice bum. Awfully nice! It's probably nothing,right? Well then, that means it's something. What is it? Well, is itsomething or someone, because if it's someone Sorry. We have no way to respond, do we. This is like the plane flyingover the desert island in a lost-at-sea movie. Sorry. Happy endings. I must think happy endings. Don't be so pessimistic. It's not impossible. It's Hoshi. They'reokay. Enterprise is okay. It's Hoshi! Rendezvous. What a beautiful word. What's wrong? And we only have a little more than one day's air left. Yes, not that it matters. They're probably travelling at what, warp two, warp three? Compared to them, we're like a garden snail. Where we go and how fastwe get there is irrelevant. How much? An hour's worth? Great. So when they reach us in two days we'll have been out ofair for eleven hours. You ever try holding your breath for elevenhours? Enterprise is going to wonder why we haven't responded, right? Maybe they'll be concerned and increase their speed. Can they see us on their sensors? Then we've got to get that blip to tell them to pick up a littlesteam. What if we fired our weapons? What if we jettison the impulse drive? Well, you could rig a self-destruct. I imagine that would makequite an explosion. Maybe even big enough to make that blip dosomething odd. What's the difference between that and travelling at a snail'space? Then I'll ask you again. Ever hold your breath for eleven hours? How does it feel to be slower than a snail? Fine. Less than twelve hours, you win. More than twelve and it'smine. Go check the pressure gauge. I can't believe we've beensitting here that long. Ten hours. The whiskey's yours. Now, why don't you give us a toast beforeyou drink it? Great idea. Why don't you climb up into the airlock and sealyourself in. Any last words you want me to pass along? What are you doing? You're crazy. Now get down from there! If anyone should go up in there, it should be me. You're theChief Engineer. Commander. It's set to stun. I don't want to use it, but I will. Go to hell! What would you know about being a hero? It takes nothing but acoward to crawl up inside a hole to die. Be my guest. I could use a little less responsibility. Now, getdown here. Your Armoury Officer, and perhaps your friend. You know, I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure you use up a lotmore oxygen when you shout like that! That's exactly what I'm saying. If there's one chance in athousand that they saw our impulse drive explode, that they increasedtheir speed, I'll take that chance. I've invested far too much timetrying to figure you out, Mister Tucker. I'm not about to accept thatit was all for nothing. We're back. How did? The Commander. You must have seen the explosion. You don't say. We saw debris from Enterprise on one of theasteroids. We assumed, we thought you were all. Sub-Commander. Isn't there something you're supposed to say to me? Heroics. Something about heroics. Trip? Mind if I call you Trip? Sleep well, myfriend. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

810,ENT,episode 14,T'POL,"Lieutenant Hess. Astrometrics detected what could be micro-singularities in thevicinity of the asteroid field. Our deflectors registered some unusual charged particles at thesame time the Tesnian ship began to malfunction. No, but our hull plating was polarised. How are you feeling? Captain Archer would be quite annoyed with me if I told you ofyour heroics. I believe he's looking forward to doing that himself inthe morning. I had no idea you could be so selfless in the face of suchdanger. Most males of your species would have given in to their fear. Vulcans can never ignore courage. And this Vulcan will never ignore Lieutenant Malcolm Reed again. Yes. May I call you Malcolm? I think it's a lovely name. Mol-Kom is the Vulcan word forserenity. Did what? Vulcans don't smile. It was when I said Stinky, wasn't it? You smiled when I saidStinky. Good morning, Stinky. It's a lovely day,` isn't it, Stinky? I've analyzed the scans we took of the Tesnian ship right beforeit crashed. I believe they were hit by a micro-singularity. This is no myth, Captain. Three of the singularities also hitEnterprise. They collided with our hull plating here, here and here. They were. The dispersal pattern suggests they dissipated onimpact. This could be a significant discovery, Captain. If we could getquantum sensor readings of the three impact points, we couldauthenticate our findings. I never intended to suggest that our crewmembers were lessimportant than a scientific discovery. Even one of this historicmagnitude. Yes. About what? Good night, Lieutenant."
811,ENT,episode 14,TUCKER,"Maybe it's another asteroid field. Well, they weren't expectingus back for three days. Maybe they finished and went off to dosomething else. Dead as a doornail. I don't understand it. I'd feel a lot more comfortable having everything in workingorder by the time Enterprise gets back. I'd rather realign every micro-circuit on this shuttle than tryto wade through that baby. I'll have you know that Superman was laced with metaphor. Subtext layered on subtext. Well, I don't recall any Europeans figuring out how to build awarp engine. No Brits, no Italians, no Serbo-Croatians. Bring us in closer. If the damn sensors were only working, we could. Bring usaround again. There. Slow down. How about the lifeboats? They could havelaunched the lifeboats before the crash. Are we sure there are no survivors? We can't just leave. That's Enterprise. At least we should findthe black boxes. What's the range in our distress beacon? I'm talking about the portable one. The one in the away kit. We've only got ten days worth of breathable air. How far toEcho Three? Well, if we could get close enough for it to pick up ourdistress beacon it'd relay the signal back to Starfleet. But at least they'd find us. They'd get their shuttlepod back,a couple of well-preserved corpses. Which way? Echo Three. Which way to Echo Three? Do you know which direction it is or don't you? That's not what I asked you. You come from a long line of Navy men and you got a real goodmemory. Look hard at those stars, find something that looks familiarand tell me which way to go. That's an order! I left it with my slide rule. Well? That's good enough for me. Take one more low pass over thewreckage and then set a course. Seeyou around, Captain. Tell them I'd love to add my two cents, but I'm trying to get alittle work done. This sensor array is more than offline. It's totally fried. Why don't you cut the crap and get back here and help me? I don't know. You could hold this flashlight, or turn down theheat. Whatever you want. I'm just getting a little tired of listeningto all your pessimism. We've got nine days. We're bound to find someone out here. Vulcans, Klingons, Suliban, Xyrillians, Andorians. God knowswho's going to be lurking around the next planet we run into. Then somebody can run into us. You ever think of that? Or seeus on their sensors. The possibilities are endless. Rations will be fine. Depends. What are you serving? Any meat loaf? Perfect. Yeah, the Captain was planning to give that to somebody. Can'tremember who. Guess it's ours now. What's that? Any good? Mister and Mrs. Reed, I realise that you've just begun a periodof mourning and that I'll never get an answer to this question, but Igot to ask it anyway. Was Malcolm always this cynical? I just need to get some sleep, Malcolm! Is that so hard tounderstand? If I don't waste some oxygen sleeping, I'm going to startgetting real cranky, and you don't want to spend your last nine dayscooped up with me when I'm cranky. So turn that thing off and get somerest. I got the receiver working but thetransmitter's a lost cause. Who's Stinky? You were talking in your sleep. You kept calling for some guynamed Stinky. You know, the range is very limited. It's probably just whitenoise. The sound of the galaxy laughing at us. I don't know, but it felt a little like whatever knocked outthe sensor array. Help me. We've got to find the hole. Then use your ears. The damn hole's too small. It's nitrogen for the coolant tanks. Just give me a fewseconds. Now let's find that leak. There's another one down here. Put your finger on it until wecan figure out what to do. Have we got anything a little closer? What? And you came close to criticising my choice of cuisine. Obviously, whatever hit us went clear through the pod. Great. How much closer to oblivion are we? In that case, I'd guess it wasn't a meteor. I wonder ifsomething like it destroyed Enterprise. Always the optimist. I'm confident there'll be a Charles Tucker the fourth one day. There was a little bar in Mill Valley where all the Starfleettrainees used to go. You know it? I met the girl of my dreams my first Friday night there. Shewas the one. There's no doubt about it. We had it all figured out. Where we'd live, how many kids we'd have. Ah, Ruby. Whatever happenedto you? You knew Ruby? Ouch. Yeah. Would another half day be worth freezingyour butt off? If we lower the thermostat in here to about minus-fivecentigrade, we should be able to use that power to enhance theefficiency of the atmosphere recyclers. I'd pick freezing. Another half day's another half day. And just what are you doing? Nice to see you're developing a more positive attitude. Charming, but you're forgetting one thing, Malcolm. If I remember my honours biology course correctly, your hairand nails keep growing for quite a while after you're dead. I'm prettysure that includes your beard. It's a little more modulated than the last one, but it could bejust a random gamma-ray burst. Wouldn't it be easier just to record one message and then addthe Dear Whoever afterward? This is your fifth or sixth identicalletter. Travis and Hoshi couldn't have been more than twenty four ortwenty five years old. Not for a minute. They died doing what they loved. She was coming along. She saved our asses on more than oneoccasion. I plan on letting her family know just how essential she was. I'll wait to tell them in person. Unlike your heartfelt letters of farewell to half the girls inSan Francisco? What's your problem with having a little hope? You're a regular grim reaper, Malcolm. Anyone ever tell youthat? Well, if this little trip is a death sentence, then it would seemto me we're entitled to a last meal. What'll it be? I'm afraid ourselection is somewhat limited. Well, then how about a drink? Are you serious? We're dead men, remember? What's the matter,Lieutenant? Are you afraid the autopsy will show your blood-alcohollevel was too high to pilot a shuttle? Live a little. That's an order. The bourbon'll provide the heat. The candle's just for mood. Tothe brave men and women of the starship Enterprise. We'll probably be dead five or six minutes earlier than wewould have been. I can live with that. Anyway, it seems to me as far asyou're concerned, the sooner the better. Because ever since we saw Enterprise spread across thatasteroid, you've done nothing but write your own obituary. All of a sudden, five or six more minutessounds kind of nice. Modulated? It can giggle all it wants, but the galaxy's not getting any ofour bourbon. Deleted sceneREED Yeah, he's always been that way. When I first taught him todive, it really got on my nerves. He'd come down to the Keys at leastonce a month, and whatever it was I was teaching him, he'd get it thefirst time. Did you ever try clearing your mask? Everybody's got to do it before they get certified. You go downand the instructor fills your mask with water, and you have to clear itby blowing out through your nose. Nobody likes to do it. Got it the first time. Filled it with water a second time justso he could clear it again. I took him on a night dive once into somecaves I'd been to a hundred times before, and for some reason I got alittle lost. So what does Archer do? He swims ahead of me and finds away out. I was the instructor. I'd been diving all my life. Then bigMister Starfleet comes down and does everything faster and better thanI could. That's when I decided to introduce him to old Waldo. A green moray. It's said he's thirty years old. Must've beentwo and a half metres long. So I took the Captain into Waldo's hole. Told him there was some beautiful starfish inside, and he reached in. Damned if old Waldo didn't take hold of his forearm. I was breaking just about every rule in the book, but he waswearing titanium mesh. I figures the worst thing that could happenwould be that Waldo would scare him a little. He deserved to have thepiss taken out of him. No such luck. He pulled Waldo clear out of the hole. I don'tthink I'd ever seen that eel's tail before. He found some pressurepoint under it's lower jaw, right about here. Waldo just let go. Wentback down his hole. That's the thing. He found it all funnier than I did. He tookme out to dinner that night. Steaks, lobsters, Kentucky bourbon. T'Pol? Are you serious? You've had too much to drink. Nah, she's a Vulcan. Oh, God. What? To Sub-Commander T'Pol. It's definitely not nothing. Shush! Definitely someone. Malcolm! That's impossible! They're still two days away. And no way to tell them to get here sooner. Are you sure you got the coordinates right? Lieutenant. If I purge the CO2 filters it'll give us a little more air. Probably less. A train leaves New York at three a. m. heading west, whileanother leaves Chicago at four thirty heading east. I never couldfigure those out. Maybe, but if we really want to get them to go to high warpwe're going to have to attract their attention. Something a little moredramatic than not answering their hails. Two days away at warp three? Oh, they can see us, maybe not tooclearly, but we should be a nice little blip on T'Pol's viewer. They're nearly a quarter of a light year away. Our plasmacannons have a range of less than ten kilometres. It would all stilllook like a single blip. It's going to take a lot more than that. What good would that do? No, I can't blow up our engine. We'd be adrift, dead in space. I'm an engineer. I won't blow up our only engine. I think I have some micro-detonators in here somewhere. I saw a great cartoon once. There were these two snails sittingon the back of a big old turtle and one snail turns to the other andsays 'Hold on, Fred. Here we go'. If I'm right, I get the rest of the bourbon. You check it. I don't think I can move my legs. Come on, let's hear it. How much air's left? That's probably the last bet I'll ever make, and I won. Ishould feel like celebrating, shouldn't I? Ten hours for two men. If there were only one ofus he'd have twenty hours, wouldn't he? That's just what I was thinking. Yeah. TellCaptain Archer that it was one hell of an honour serving with him. We don't know whether or not they saw our little display ofpyrotechnics, but either way this'll double your chances. Sit down, Lieutenant. I'm also in charge of deciding who's going into this airlock. Do I make myself clear? What are you going to do? Kill me? Put it down! Stop trying to be a hero. It doesn't suityou. Then go ahead and shoot me, but you better hope we don't makeit, because if we survive the first thing I'm going to do is bust yourass back to Crewman Second Class for insubordination. Who the hell do you think you are? Friends don't shoot each other! So what are you saying? That you'd rather have Enterprise findthe two of us dead in here?"

884,ENT,episode 15,ARCHER,"Not exactly. Look familiar? This was my first astronomy book. My father gotit for me on my eighth birthday. I used to stare at the cover forhours. The Arachnid Nebula. Who'd ever have thought I'd get to see itin person. It's less than a light year away. We'll be there in a fewhours. I had high hopes when I was a kid. Yes? Do you know who it is? Doesn't look like any Vulcan ship I've ever seen. It is. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer. I get the feeling you weren't sent out here by the HighCommand. What brings you out this far? From what I'm told, Vulcans aren't that interested inexploring. Certainly. We'll see what we can do. That's good to know. I was starting to think they'd singled usout. Our chef's had a lot of experience lately preparing Vulcan dishes. T'Pol says he's gotten pretty good at it. Oh, it's called chicken. Of course. It's, er, meat, you know. So, when did you leave Vulcan? You said you were explorers? I'm sorry? My Chief Engineer tells me your repairs are going to take threeor four days. We were going to use that time to explore the nebula, ifyou don't mind tagging along. Well, that shouldn't be a problem. Tell him Chef's recipes are usually classified but, we'll makean exception in this case. I thought you'd be spending a little moretime getting to know our guests. It seems to me like, you've been busy avoiding them. I canunderstand that you might not approve of what they're trying to do, butfor all we know they're onto something. Is it? Eight years. That's a pretty good track record. Maybe I'm just relieved to finally meet some Vulcans who aren'tgiving me a hard time. Then again, if they have found this balance. Unless my instincts are way off, they don't seem very dangerousto me. But I could be wrong. I can't order you to spend time with them,but I would encourage you to keep an open mind. Eight billion? Are you sure? My astronomy book said it was only six and a half. How long would it take to chart that thing? We should have someone on your ship to monitor the data. Would you mind working from there? Glad you dropped by. Take us in, Travis. Starfleet? I'll take it in my ready room. Admiral Forrest. Good to see you. A Vulcan crew. How'd you know? A favour from me? Â FORREST I don't think so. What do they want me to do? Yes. I'll see what I can do. Understood. Come in.Â KOV Please have a seat. That's good to hear. I called you here to pass along a message from your father. Actually, it came through a Vulcan ambassador. I'm sorry to bethe one to tell you this, but your father is very ill. He wants you tocontact him as soon as possible. If you'd like, my comm. officer canarrange the transmission. I know it's none of my business, but do you plan on contactinghim? He's dying, Kov. From what I hear you've become fast friends. Maybe you'll havebetter luck than I did. Do your best. What about this Tolaris fellow? T'Pol's been spending a lot of time with him lately. Two days ago she couldn't wait to get these people off theship. I practically had to order her to work with him. Now, they'realmost inseparable. Well, let me know how it goes with Kov. Come in. Morning. Can I get you something? Coffee? Have a seat. Trip tells me the repairs to your ship are almostfinished. You should be on your way pretty soon. How's that survey coming along? That's great news. I wanted to thank you for all of your help. Starfleet's finest. Sleep well last night? Tossed and turned. Always happens whenever we're exploringsomeplace new. Sorry to keep you. I'm afraid you'll be working alone today. Sub-Commander T'Pol's in Sickbay. From what the doctor tellsme, she's in pretty bad shape. You know damn well what happened. She told me about your, whatdid she call it, mind-meld? She said when she asked you to stop, yougot angry. She said she had to force you away. You assaulted a member of my crew. Panic doesn't land you in Sickbay. Our doctor said she couldhave suffered neurological damage, thanks to you. You've been manipulating her ever since you came aboard. T'Pol's had enough of your help. Stay away from her. I told you, it's over. Maybe I'm not making myself clear. Sickbay's off-limits. What's wrong, Tolaris? Getting angry? I thought you had thatunder control. T'Pol's right. You've got a temper. Go to hell. If I'd known I was going to get thrown across the room thathard, I might have tried a different approach. I think it's time youand your friends went on your merry way. Is this a bad time? Feeling any better? About twenty minutes ago. You do this every night? I think I finally understand why. I'll see you in the morning. T'POL; Captain. Do you dream? Sure. Sometimes they're even in colour. Most nights."

That's not possible. I am here as an observer. I'm not capable of feeling offence. They've asked for any medical supplies wecan spare and a thousand litres of plasma coolant. Tavin has also requested the recipe for Chicken Marsala. I've been busy. That's unlikely. Just because they smile and eat chicken doesn't mean they'velearned to master their emotions. They're not the first ones to attempt this, Captain. Others havetried to reintegrate their emotions. They all failed. What they'redoing is dangerous. It is. Most of them are asleep. It's quite late. What would you like? Mint tea, hot. You can try something else. Their selection of Vulcan beverages is limited. Yes. Unless you need further assistance I spent two years at the Vulcan consulate on Earth and sevenmonths on Enterprise. You may be right. On occasion, I also drink chamomile tea. You're easily amused. Captain Archer needs a Science Officer. What makes you say that? I have yet to mediate this evening. Perhaps that's what you'resensing. So you've said. You and your colleagues have chosen a recklesspath. History's shown that Vulcans who attempt to embrace theiremotions often revert to their primal nature. I've already eaten. Another time, perhaps. Several weeks. No. Not necessarily. It is aesthetically pleasing. It's curious that people whoreject Surak's teachings would display his likeness. I doubt many would agree with you. What did you do on Vulcan before you left? You gave up a great deal to wander the galaxy in a transport. Not recently. Once. I should take these readings back to Enterprise. That won't be necessary. I believe I can explain my symptoms. Last night I neglected tomeditate before I went to sleep. As a result, I awoke feeling agitated. All I need is an injection of inaprovaline. Twenty five milligramsshould suffice. I've become acquainted with one of them. He suggested that mydreams might be more interesting if I didn't meditate. He was wrong. They were unsettling. It was a foolish thing todo. There are too many risks. It would be unwise to continue. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. The lateral sensors were out of alignment. I haven't had achance to scan the disodium layer. Yes. I'd rather not discuss them. I plan to resume meditating tonight. It was a mistake to try in the first place. I'm reading over twenty million cubic metres of disodium as wellas traces of ethylchlorate. It involved a memory. I was walking down a street in SanFrancisco on Earth. I was curious about human recreation. I wanted to see it formyself. It was late. Everyone in the compound had gone to sleep. Ididn't see any harm in leaving for a couple of hours. I simply walked. Then I heard music. It was unusual, chaotic, but I was drawn to it. I went into a restaurant where musicians were playing. I sat ata table. I can't remember. I felt invigorated. Briefly. They finished playing and I returned to the compound. Mind meld? How does it work? Proceed. It's not working. Yes. Yes. I don't know. I have to return to the compound. Let me go. No! Stop. Stop! This was a mistake. Please go. Leave! T'Pol to Sickbay. Come in. Not at all. Has the Vulcan ship left? Then yes, I'm feeling better. Every night. Is it enjoyable? I envy you. Goodnight. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present. The Star Trek webpages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only.

896,ENT,episode 15,TUCKER,"I've never seenan engine this far gone. We're going to have to swap out every plasmarelay in your reactor. Yeah, nearly a third of the crew. You haven't been around humans too much, have you? More like three. Eight hours. We sleep for eight hours. In my case, about six. When we're through here maybe we can get a bite to eat. I might be ableto clear up some of your misconceptions. Call me Trip. Where'd you hear that?  You must think we're a bunch of barbarians. Well, I hope you'll tell all your friends. Set the recordstraight. There's, er, something I've always wondered about Vulcans. Maybe you could clear it up for me. It's kind of personal. Well, I've learned about your marriage customs. How yourparents arrange the whole thing when you're young, stuff like that but,what about, you know. It's not a topic I've heard Vulcans discuss. Seven years? You up for seconds? You want me to talk to him? Well, I'll try, but something tells me it won't be as simple asfixing an engine. He's got a lot of resentment. Aye, sir. Well, I haven't really gotten to know him. He seems kind ofquiet, though. A little sullen. Is that a problem? If I didn't know better I'd say you were a little jealous. If Iwas the only human on a ship full of Vulcans and we ran into an Earthvessel, I'd be spending as much time with them as I could. She likesbeing around her own kind. Who doesn't? Yes, sir. I don't mean to put too fine a point on this, but you've got alimited window of opportunity. Once it closes Well, probably a faulty injector. Should be easy enough to fix. Do Vulcans dance? You know I remember the first dance I ever went to. Bayshore ElementaryPanama City, Florida. A girl I had a crush on, Melissa Lyles, was goingto be there. So I spent weeks practicing the two-step with my brother. I wanted to make sure I was ready. She was wearing a red dress thatnight. Prettiest girl there. All I wanted to do was ask her to dancewith me, but I never worked up the courage to go over and talk to her. I caught her looking at me a couple times but, I ended up just standingin a corner with my buddies. It's been more than twenty years and I'm still kicking myselffor not asking that girl to dance. You probably don't know this, butregret is one of the strongest emotions and one of the saddest. I havea feeling you haven't had a brush with it yet, but it sounds to me likeyou're pretty close. That's something you might want to avoid. Keep an eye on the intermix pressure. Don't let it drift above five thousand. And watch those injector ports. Is that so? I'm glad to hear it. That'll give you a little more time tothink about making that call. Anytime."

You live on a humanstarship. That's not something that many Vulcans would be comfortablewith. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. So this is the mess hall. The crew must not have much of an appetite. Could you show me how to operate this? I'm not sure. I don't have much experience with human food. What's that?Â T'POL That'll be fine. Thank you. It has a lot of flavour. No, it's fine. I'm just surprised. Do you like the taste? But it can make Vulcan tea. Interesting. How long have you lived among humans? That's a long time away from home. Living here has obviouslyaffected you in ways that you don't realise. And you have a sense of humour. A concept that most Vulcanscan't seem to grasp. There's that humour again. I'm curious, why do you stay here? Is that the only reason? Maybe you're more attached to thesepeople than you'd care to admit. Your emotions are much closer to the surface than otherVulcans. They're easier to read. This may surprise you, but we still meditate. The balancebetween emotion and logic requires constant discipline. Have we? That's a myth. Propaganda from five thousand years ago. Ourprimal nature, T'Pol, is not as dangerous as you think. CommanderTucker suggests that I try something called pizza. Would you care tojoin me? Look at that. I've never seen anything so beautiful. You'd probablyconsider that an emotional reaction. Pleasing. Coming from you, that's practically an outburst. We don't reject his teachings. We simply disagree with howthey're interpreted. Have you read his original text? He never intendedfor us to purge our emotions. He wanted us to master them, and thencarefully integrate them into our lives. That doesn't mean we're wrong. I taught literature at the Shirkar Academy. I don't have any regrets. I always knew there had to be moreto life than just logic and reason. Haven't you ever felt that way? But you did once? T'Pol, you said that you meditated each night. Tonight, don't. See what happens. I think you'll find your dreams will be far moreinteresting. You're a scientist. Consider it an experiment. Our primal nature isn't as dangerous as you think. Do you like the taste? You must havelearned a great deal about emotion. Why do you stay here? Good morning. Chamomile? How did it go? I mean last night. Did you take my advice? And your dreams? It will get easier. Tonight will be less disturbing. You can't give up after one trial. Wasn't there anything enjoyable about the experience? We can run the scans later. Tell me about your dreams. Youremotions were closer to the surface. It must have been intense. Why did you leave the compound? So you broke protocol? Where did you go? Music? Go on. How did you feel? Try. Emotion. You felt emotion. You could feel that way again, T'Pol. It isn't difficult, andit's nothing to be afraid of. I can show you how. It's an ancient technique. It was abandoned centuries ago, butwe've discovered that it can help us access our emotions. I'd begin by creating a telepathic link. We would be able toshare our memories, our thoughts. In essence, we would become one mind. It's quite an experience, but it is profoundly intimate. Are youprepared for that? If you'd like, we could try a more traditional formof guided meditation but it wouldn't be nearly as effective. It's all right. Close your eyes. Try to focus on myvoice. My mind to your mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. Our mindsare merging, our minds are becoming one. You're resisting. Relax. My mind to your mind. Your thoughtsto my thoughts. Our minds are merging, our minds are becoming one. Am I with you? Can you sense my thoughts? You're doing well. I want you to think about that night whenyou left the compound. Imagine yourself walking down that street. Good. Now listen. Can you hear the music? Listen. Now follow it. I can see why you were drawn to this place. It's unlikeanything on Vulcan. I'm not surprised it triggered an emotional response. You said you wereinvigorated, what else? Yes, you do. You're just not used to describing your emotions. You experienced other things. Excitement about breaking protocol,apprehension about getting caught, and the music, the music made youfeel elated. Allow yourself to feel these emotions again. Don't holdthem back. You're anxious. It's just another emotion. Stay with me, T'Pol. No. You've made progress. Don't give up now. T'Pol. You're feeling anger. Your emotions are breaking thesurface. Embrace them! What a shame. Good morning. No, thanks. Yes. We'll be done this afternoon. It was the least we could do. Besides, we've enjoyed spendingour time here. You have an exceptional crew, Captain. Well enough. You? I understand. Well, if there's nothing more, Captain, I'meager to get back to work. We have another twenty million cubickilometres to chart. Oh? That's unfortunate. What happened? What happened between us is personal. It's not your concern. I did no such thing. Mind-melds can be emotionally turbulent. She simply panicked. No one forced her to try the meld. She did it willingly. I am helping her shed a lifetime of repression, and you of allpeople should understand what I'm trying to do. You're human. I need togo see her. She is in a crucial stage of her awakening. She needsguidance. I think that's for her to decide. You're in my way, Captain. You'd be wise to let me leave. Move aside. Now! You planned this."
968,ENT,episode 15,KOV,"There are a lot of women onyour ship. Is it true you mate year-round, with any of them you choose? You're the first we've met, but I've heard a lot of stories. Yourpeople indulge their passions. Do you really eat six meals a day? And what about sleep? I understand you spend more than half theday in bed. I'd like that, Commander. A Vulcan anthropologist told me he'd seen the ritual during anEarth expedition. I see. Your species does have a reputation, but I've always suspected thestories were exaggerated. Gladly. Please. Go ahead. Ah, you mean sex. Well, we do have it, if that's what you're asking. No, please join us, Mister? Over the past few years, we've been developing methods toaccelerate the mating cycle. I've had enough, thank you. Back to work? A pleasure meeting you,Mister Reed. The repairs to our propulsion system are going well. MisterTucker's been very helpful. Is there a problem? You spoke with him? It's a kind offer, but I'll deal with this myself. Thanks for themessage. Kov stands to leave.) The last time I spoke with my father, he said I'd brought shame tofifteen generations of our family. If it isn't too much trouble, would you please send a message backfor me? Tell him that we said goodbye a long time ago. I've already been through this with yourCaptain.Â TUCKER If you knew my father, you'd understand. I consider you a friend, Trip, and I appreciate what you're tryingto do, but please don't. I have no intention of contacting him. Itest-fired our port thruster last night. It's still off by twelvepercent. No. Only when it's part of some tedious ceremony. Interesting, but what does that have to do with our thrusterproblem? Five thousand. I will. I thought you'd like to know, I got an updateon my father. Apparently, his condition's improved. The surgeons implanted a vaso-stimulator. They say, with any luckit'll extend his life a few years. I already did. My father's the one who gave me the good news. Thank you, Trip."
969,ENT,episode 15,TAVIN,"Is this the Earth vessel Enterprise? My name is Tavin, Captain of the Vahklas. It'svery good to meet you. Not quite. We're a civilian ship. I suppose you could say we're on a mission ofexploration. We're not typical Vulcans. I'd be happy toexplain, but first I'd like to ask a favour. Our propulsion and life-support systems are inneed of repair. We'd be grateful for any assistance you could offer. We've noticed the High Command looking over our shoulders onseveral occasions as well. What is that? May I? It looks delicious. Eight years ago. Yes, but it's not space we're exploring. It's ourselves. Mmm! Vulcans without logic. It's a name the Elders give to anyone whodisagrees with the ancestral teachings, but it's not entirely accurate. We haven't abandoned logic. We've simply learned to exist without theneed to continually repress our emotions. It's taken years ofexperimentation, but we've managed to find a balance between the two. Logic is an essential part of Vulcan existence, but it has tocomplement emotions, not exclude them. Not at all. My vessel is equipped with translinear sensors. We could helpyou complete the survey a good deal quicker."

972,ENT,episode 16,ARCHER,"We couldn't do this in my ready room? Just take the picture. Do Vulcan captains have their portraits hanging at the HighCommand? Why can't they just use a photo from my file? I thought there weren't any systems along this course. Put it up. Magnify. Lay in a course. Let's take a closer look. Give it a rest, Trip. Oases. Any people? Try to hail them. We should be right over that ship. I used to say I could land a shuttlepod with my eyes closed. It doesn't have to be. Why don't you let me play Captain for a while, Malcolm? Thisreminds me of the rain forest in New Zealand. I earned my wildernessmerit badge there. I was an Eagle Scout. Really? How many merit badges? Twenty six. We spot any more creatures like that and we'll earn ourExobiology badges. Anyone home? We're from the Starship Enterprise. Is thereanyone here? You and Malcolm check it out. We'll stay here in case anyoneshows up. Everything's fine. These are the Eska. This is T'Pol, my science officer, and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed. We're just here to explore. We'd like to stay for a while, ifthat's all right. It's a big planet. We could find another landingsite, but I was hoping you might enjoy the company. You aren't exactly roughing it. Hunting went out of style on Earth over a hundred years ago. That doesn't mean we don't appreciate your hospitality. It's up to our hosts. Captain's starlog, supplemental. Trip and Malcolmare bringing Hoshi back to Enterprise and putting together some campinggear to bring back to the surface. Sensible. Very much. Thanks for sharing your camp with us. Good night. I think I'll sit up for a while. Yeah. Hello? Is someone there? Who's there? Are there any others in your hunting party? I'm sure. Archer. Thanks, Travis. Archer out. She was young, long blonde hair. She was wearing some kind of anightgown. It wasn't a dream. She said my name. She knew who I was and, Ithink I knew her. There was something about her. I, I've seen her before. She was real. What's the hurry? Could be worth checking out while Malcolm's on his safari. Yes, fine. Reminds me of Yellowstone. Permission granted. Stay in contact. I wasn't hallucinating. I know. Trip, have you ever known me to do anything foolish? Imean, really foolish? Last night I walked into an alien jungle, alone, chasing awoman who couldn't possibly have been there. It was like I was being drawn to her. Like I didn't have anycontrol over what I was doing. I can't explain it. Who are you? How do you know my name? You're speaking English. I know you. How is that possible? You said you needed me. Why? Different? What is it? What's wrong? I don't want to harm you. Then who? Who wants to harm you? Fine. Just taking some scans. Archer to Enterprise. Tell Doctor Phlox to stand by. We've got a doctor on board our ship. I've alerted him to standby. Let's get him back to the shuttlepod. You and Malcolm go withhim. I'm not ready to leave. Thanks. T'Pol, come in. I saw her again, near the thermalvents. She spoke to me. She said she needed me. I think someone may be trying to hurther. And have Doctor Phlox take a look at me? There are nopsychotropic compounds here. I wasn't hallucinating, and I wasn't dreaming. I don't know what she is. I know it's not possible for her tobe human, but she's appearing to me for a reason and I'm going tofigure out what it is. I'm going to find her. No. I have to. She's chosen to communicate with me. I don't knowwhy, but I don't think she'd reveal herself if anyone else was around. What? Hello? Are you there? I'm alone. You're not a hallucination. You're real. I can touch you. But you're not human, are you. Human, like me. We? There are more of you? Where? I haven't seen others. I see a beautiful woman. How do you know what I want? You're telepathic. That's how you know my language. Then you must know why I'm so drawn to you. Why I feel like Iknow you. From where? Why did you choose me? You said that before. How? Who am I different from? You mean the Eska. To hunt. It was no problem, really. To good hunting tomorrow. All those imaging sensors and you couldn't see where they went? Then why travel light years to hunt here? Seems like a long wayto come just to shoot a few wild pigs. Boar, wolves, some large reptiles. It doesn't seem thatdifferent. What are you talking about? Come on, fellas. That seems pretty far-fetched. But she looked human. How do you catch them? They know damn well what they're doing. Hunting wild boar is one thing, but they're killing a sentientspecies. Unless we find a more permanent solution. The hunters said the shape-shifters emit a chemical signaturewhen they're afraid. That's what gives them away. You have a sample oftheir cells. Can you find a way to mask that chemical? That would shieldthem from the hunters' scans. We may not be able to stop them from hunting here, but we couldlevel the playing field. Trip. No, thanks. Do you know any poetry? When I was a kid, if I had trouble sleeping my mother wouldrecite a poem to me. There was one I always asked for. Had a funnyname. TheSong of the Wandering Aengus. I didn't learn till I was older that it was by Yeats. 'I went out tothe hazel wood Because a fire was in my head.' Anyway, the man in thepoem catches a fish, and it turns into a beautiful woman with appleblossoms in her hair. She calls his name and then vanishes. He spends the rest of his life searching for her. His vision ofperfection, I suppose. Something he could never quite find. It's her. When I listened to the poem I must have created an image ofthat woman in my mind. I haven't thought about it in years. That's whyI didn't recognise her at first. She isn't someone that I ever knew,she's someone I imagined as a child. The elusive woman from the poem. I don't know. Archer. I'll be right there. She may just be something I envisioned along time ago, but I'll be damned if I'm going to let anyone shoot her. How was the hunt? Any luck? We wanted to take a few more scans before we left. Iseverything all right? Sorry to hear it. Looks like you won't be taking home anytrophies this year. I guess we must be bad luck. Are you there? They're gone. Did you give the others the masking agent? It'll keep you safe. I know who you are. Thank you for reminding me. I won't. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present. The Star Trek webpages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only.

There's a shipdown there. Infrared's useless. There's too much heatcoming from those thermal vents. Well, the proof's in the pudding, Captain. Follow me. You were a Boy Scout, sir? Oh, so was I. Twenty eight. You? Oh, that's not bad, sir. Actually, I already have that one. Did you hear that? Anything? It's not gone. Captain, are you all right? Pleased to meet you. Your friends nearly shot me back there. Mmm. No argument here. I'm curious why our sensors didn't detectyou. That gear you carry seems pretty elaborate to take down a fewgame animals. I wonder if I might join one of your hunts. You were able to sneak up on us without being detected by ournight-vision sensors. I'd like to see how you did that. I promise Iwon't kill anything, sir. Like those bore worms. I wouldn't miss it. Night. I suppose I'll turn in then. A nightgown, sir? These can detect infrared. I'll try to keep up. What is it? Is there something out there? Well, let's find out. I didn't see it. We split off to follow another trail. So, how'd you lose them? They're well armed and they know the terrain. I wouldn't want totry and take their weapons from them."

983,ENT,episode 16,T'POL,"Vulcans are revered for their accomplishments, not for the waythey look. It's a rogue. A planet that's broken out of its orbit. This planet supports a diverse animal population. Hot gas is vented from the planet's interior. Most of the lifeforms are concentrated in those areas. No evidence of humanoid life. I'm scanning for a break in the canopy. There's a clearing ahead, nine hundred metres, but it's not muchbigger than the shuttlepod. Captain, the vessel is that way, six hundred metres. Captain. I'm still not detecting any biosigns, but their ship's less thantwo hundred metres in that direction. Yes. For a moment, I had a humanoid biosign. It's gone. Have we trespassed in your territory? You're hunters. To kill the indigenous species? We can start with the entomologists thenbring the other bioscience teams down. I'd recommend we limit thenumber of crewmen on the surface to six at a time. Perhaps you were dreaming. Are those volcanic vents? It's more like the grottoes of Deneva Prime. I'm detecting alarge geothermal shaft sixty metres in that direction. I'd like toexamine it. Sir? Are you all right? There's no internal damage but he's lost a great deal of blood. Lieutenant Reed reports they've docked withEnterprise. What did she say? I believe you should reconsider returning to Enterprise. So the only logical conclusion is that she is a real humanwoman? How? I'll go with you. A well-armed hunter was nearly killed today. It would be foolishto go into the jungle alone. Is that your only reason for going by yourself? With respect, Captain, I wonder if you would be so determined tofind this apparition if it were a scantily-clad man. Do you hunt on your own world? They sound like intelligent, sentient beings. I find this as distasteful as you do, Captain. I'm just not surehow we can stop them. We have no right to, in any case. Even if we stop them, their people will continue to come hereand hunt. They've done it for hundreds of years."

Every recruit walking into Starfleet Commandis going to see this on the wall. There's a reflection from that status display. Couldyou kill the monitors in the Situation Room? Come on, T'Pol. The artistin Oakland needs a good picture to paint from. Except for the really important ones, who get mummified. Captain Archer in command. Maybe they want to be left alone. A single ship on a darkplanet? Maybe they're on their honeymoon. If the bugs glow in the dark, at least youcan tell when they've crawled into your sleeping bag. Bore worms? Sounds like a good idea. Have fun. If the Captain says he saw her, he saw her. Sir? What are you going after today? I'll get my camera. So, she was wearing a nightgown? You think she's real. Captain, it doesn't make any sense. I remember a poker game at Jupiter Station once. Other thanthat. That might qualify. She must have been some woman. Captain? You disappeared on us. What are you doing out here? What did that? How's he doing, Doc? I'll let the Captain know. They call it a drayjin. It looks like a big nasty pig. Kind oftastes like one, too. What am I looking at? You lost the Drayjin but at least you gotsome scars to show for it. Apparently. You mean ghosts? What right do they have to come to this planet and shoot thelocals? Evening, Captain. Get you anything? Milk, cold. You mean besides 'There was a young lady from Ipswich'? And? Captain. Why do you think this shape-shifter reached into your mind andpicked an image you'd almost forgotten? Maybe that poem's been on your mind more than you realise. You sure? You look pretty rattled."

They're mutating. It's as if they're trying to change into something but can't quitefigure out what. That must have been a most unusual pig. Captain? I've been analyzing their mutative ability.

Don't underestimate the game on this planet. They often getthe better of us. No. You wouldn't be the first person who looked into the jungleand saw something that wasn't there. We saw a pack of fire wolves yesterday about six kilometresfrom here. It's a difficult hike. It could be a plume of steam. They can fool our thermalscanners. Well, thanks to your doctor I don't even have that. We hunt more than wild pigs. Wraiths. You don't even know if it was a she. That's why we were tracking you the day you arrived. Wethought they'd taken your form. In recent years, we learned when you corner them they panic,especially the young ones. Are you sure? I'm not picking up a signature. It was probably just adrayjin. Where is it? Well, if it's cornered, it must be terrified. Why can't wedetect it? Maybe our scanners aren't working. We need to leave. Our scanners are malfunctioning."
1059,ENT,episode 16,SHIRAHT,"We're sorry. There are dangerous animals in the forest. Nothing. Hunters often wait decades for a chance to come here. Damrus. I'm trying. If you can't keep him steady. The wound's deep. Give me the bonding kit. We need him for the hunt. Their doctor can help. We only havetwo more days. Well, we have to drink to something since we came backempty-handed. They might as well be. They're shape-shifters. They can look like anything. Evenpeople you know. They assume the exact characteristics of whatever they become. They turn into a rock, all you see is a rock. Even on scanners. It's a wraith. I saw it shift. It's a wraith. I'm not picking up anything. I'm all right."

I see what eludes you. I know more than your language. You do know me. You're different. The others. The only ones who have ever come here, before you. Do you know why they come? To hunt us, Jonathan. We are what they prize above all else. Yes. For now. Yes. Thank you. You remembered. Never stop seeking what seems unobtainable. Goodbye, Jonathan. Don't forget me."
1061,ENT,episode 16,DAMRUS,"My name is Damrus. We've never seen other humanoids here before. This planet is no one's territory, but it's a special place forus. Drayjin meat is one of life's great pleasure. We use sensing cloaks. They keep the wildlife from spotting us. We're on an expedition. Our people have been coming here for nine generations. Taking wild animals is part of our tradition. There are higherprimates here. We don't touch them. I thought you people didn't approve. Enjoying yourselves? We're heading out in six hours. I suggest you get some sleep,if you're still planning to come along. Good night. Certainly no human females. You sure she wasn't from yourvessel? On this planet, it's always night. You're surrounded by thingsyou can hear, but not see. It can stimulate the imagination. Captain Archer, what are the chances you'd encounter ahalf-naked woman who you think you know dozens of light years from yourhomeworld? Go to sleep. If you're lucky, maybe she'll visit you in yourdreams. Among other things. We'd appreciate it. We only have two days left. To preserve Dakala, our law states that we're allowed to hunthere for four days each year. Then we have to leave. Yes. That area's particularly active. Mineral springs, steamvents. It's quite spectacular. Did you sleep well, Captain? Good. If you see any beautiful females today you'll be sure tolet us know. Drayjin. A female. They're very unpredictable. Wraith! No point in all of us chasing a sensor ghost. You two stay onthe trail. Take care of our guest. We'll catch up. Hold him. Burzaan, you're going to be fine but you have to be still. It was a drayjin. The females can be very aggressive,especially if they're protecting a nest. We're prepared to deal with injuries here, Captain. Thank you, Captain. Obviously, we want him to have the besttreatment. You should all return to your ship. We came to this planetaware of its dangers. You didn't. To the Captain and his fine physician. Drayjin are migratory. By the time we got back, they moved on. They're more elusive than you give them credit for. Yes. The prey here is different. Imagine hunting something that can get inside your mind, senseyour thoughts. Is that different enough? Does it? You saw one yourself. Your mystery woman. She wasundoubtedly a wraith who wandered too close to camp. That's how they trick you. Not the way you or I would measure intelligence. It's aninstinctual response. Before we learned how to spot them they killed more of us thanwe did of them. My father came here with eight other hunters. Theydrove a group of wraiths into a blind canyon. My father was sure thatthey had them cut off. But when they moved in the wraiths were waiting. They'd read the hunters' minds. They knew their plan. My father made itout, but only two of his friends survived. When they're afraid, they emit a chemical signature. Ourscanners have been modified to detect it. It gives us an advantage. Stay with it. It has to be here. There's no way out. It may not be afraid now, but it's about to be. Something's wrong. We should have seen it. All of them? Let's get back to camp. What are you doing here? We're fine. Strange, but we never failed on a hunt before you arrived."

I don't know what you're talking about. This is a vessel of exploration not a cargo ship. We don't doany commerce. Whatever it is you're after, you won't find it here. I just told you. Whoever you are, just take what you want and get off of myship. Slave market? Wait. I'll show you where the vault is, if you let me keep half thegold. Gold bars. Hundreds of them. But I keep half. Forty. Thirty five and not a bar less. You'll never find the vaultwithout my help. No deal. I'd rather you take the women and go. If you're going to make a habit out of this, you might want toget a bigger ship. Really. I was getting the impression you were in charge. How do you like it so far? What do you need all this for, anyway? You seem to already haveplenty of technology. Rules of Acquisition? Back on my home world that kind of thinking almost destroyedour civilisation. We? So what do you do, split the profits equally between the fourof you? You must get a bigger percentage than your crewmates. Oh, that doesn't seem fair. You're the one doing all the work. Really. I assume he charges you for his services. Another one of your rules? Do you think you could bring me a glass of water? It comes out of a dispenser in themess hall. Oh, do you think you could bring me some food while you're atit? Whatever's left in the serving case. That is, if you haven'talready taken everything. Never better. You? I'm not surprised. These aliens are taking everything they canget their hands on. I don't know yet. Can you get a phase pistol? There are fourteen weapons lockers on this ship. They can'thave emptied every one of them. I've got an idea, but you're going to need some help to pull itoff. They used a hypospray to wake me up. It's in Launch bay two. Glad you're enjoying it. Do you mind? She's a Vulcan. They're really not all thatinteresting once you get to know them. Trust me. She's got no sense of humor. She's alwayscomplaining. Krem. I'm surprised your friend didn't get electrocuted. You can'tjust yank out an antimatter injector like it was a light bulb. I'll have to take the injector assembly offline. Even if your cousin does find the vault, what makes you thinkhe's going to share the gold with you? If you never see the vault, you'll never know what's in it. Hecould try to cheat you out of your share. What happened to 'Never allow family to stand in the way ofprofit'? I've seen the way the others treat you. One of them said youhave no talent for business. Why not prove them wrong? I've got aproposition for you. Help me capture your associates and I'll show youwhere the vault is. We'll split the gold, fifty-fifty. Once they're inthe Brig you can fly off a wealthy man. You said you've always dreamedof having your own ship. You're the one holding the gun. Think about it. No more takingorders, getting stuck with the menial work. I'll even throw in theVulcan female. So, what'll it be? Opportunities like this don't comealong every day. It's your loss. What's next? Where do you expect me to put it? There's hardly any room lefton your ship. I think it's time you decided what you really want tokeep. Can't you make a simple decision by yourself? If you want torun your own ship someday, maybe you should start showing a littleinitiative. And you never will be, with that attitude. My Chief Engineer. Don't ask me. I haven't seen anybody. You? Trip. Not another word, Commander. That's an order. You take them anywhere near that vault, and I'll throw you inthe Brig for insubordination. I'm warning you, Trip. What's your wife worth? Five bars of gold, maybe six? Let themtake Hoshi, and I'll give you ten. All right, fifteen. You sure told him. My back. I think I pulled a muscle. It's an old water-polo injury. Flares up every now and then. I just need to rest. Then you'd better get working. Did it work? Do you have the key? I'll make it up to you. Five bars of gold? Open these things, Sub-Commander. That's anorder. Yeah, Porthos. You okay? I'm going to be contacting the Vulcan HighCommand as well as Starfleet. If you come within a light year of anyone of our ships you won't know what hit you. If you want to be unshackled, you might think about showingKrem here a little more respect."

Whatever put the others to sleep didn't affect me in the sameway. My body works differently than the humans. That's the name of their species. They're a terrible race. Deceitful, cruel. It wasn't my choice. I'm a captive here. They've enslaved me. Please, take me with you. I'm well-trained in the arts of pleasure, but I'm not familiarwith oo-mox. Like this? And this? Perfectly.

From what I can tell, you and I are the only ones on the shipstill standing. I would've tried to wake some of the others but there'snothing left in Sickbay to do it with. Who are they? They've cleaned out the armoury. Trust me, Captain, I've already checked. You're going to be fine. Just because a guy's in his underwearyou think the worst. Doctor Phlox made me clear bio-scan after I got back from thatlunar survey. While I was in decon, something knocked out the entirecrew. Aliens are in control of the ship. You okay? Come on, we've got work to do. I can't wake anybody else up. This hypospray is empty. Let'sgo, unless you want to be sold into slavery. Wait. I'll show you the vault. Leave the women here, and I'll let you have the gold. I'm not letting them take my wife. No. Her name's Hoshi, and you're going to keep your filthyhands off her. Do we have a deal? You don't give a damn about this crew. All you care about isyour precious gold. You're a greedy son of a bitch. What! You'll leave the women? Follow me. Bottom deck. You obviously didn't look in the right place. Not yet. We have a thousand conduits like that on this ship. This way. That's the beauty of this thing. It's impossible to find unlessyou know exactly where you're going. Keep your shirt on. It's close. Watch your head. Relax. We're here. It's all yours. Better let me go in first. Knowing Captain Archer, he's probably rigged the place withbooby traps. Just give me a few minutes to check it out. Sorry fellas, bank must be closed today."

Let's get them back to the ship see if we can find out whathappened here. Go ahead. We're on our way. Who attacked you? Three years. You've made quite a home for yourselves here. Well, you do now. Our ship is big enough for all of you. We cantake you home. What about their engines? We have resources you may not have. It's worth a shot. There's a lot of damage. Maybe they were hit by some kind of weapon we're not familiarwith. You're not buying that, either. Just because they're a little skittish doesn't mean they're upto something. What about it? Do we still have their data module? Have Hoshi download it. Let me know as soon as she hasanything. Archer to Commander Tucker. Could you come to my ready room? I hear you've been spending a lot of timewith Liana. I'm sure you have, Trip. This doesn't have anything to do withthat. We were wondering if you'd noticed any strange behaviour fromher or any of the others. According to this, they weren't attacked. There was an accidenton board. It's not just the data module. It went down nearly twenty two years ago, Trip. Malcolm found one. It was still in orbit. We're bringing it onboard. I'm not quite sure. Find T'Pol. I'm going to go talk to the captain. That'd be easier to believe if you weren't hiding things fromus. No, she didn't, but if you want any more help from us we'regoing to need some answers. Not without my officers. We'll set the shuttle down in thefoothills south of their ship. Their dampening field should leave them as blind as we are. We'll go in through theirescape pod ports. That should put us near Engineering and theircomputer room. Work your way down the port side. Comm. us if you find T'Pol,and be careful. You all right? Good question. What happened to your crew? Your real crew. But the ones you based them on, the crew of this ship, whereare they? Sounds like you did everything you could to save the ship. Any father would have done the same thing. I can't imagine what making that decision must have been like,but it was a long time ago. You need to consider your daughter now. You all right? We'll finish working on yourholographic systems, if that's what you want. But you should be surethat's all the help you need from us. It may be a long time beforeanyone comes by here again. Come in.

No indicationsof any weapons fire. It's possible. They also say they haven't sent out a distresscall because it'd give away their position. They crashed three years ago, sir. Whoever attacked them has tobe gone by now. Why are they still hiding? There's also their airponics bay. How are they surviving down there? It doesn't make any sense. Hoshi translated the data module we found on their ship, and wewere able to reconstruct what happened right before they crashed. There are some gaps in the data, but it looks like some kind ofcatastrophic malfunction. There was a massive depressurization when theship went down. When their story didn't check out the Captain asked me to runsome detailed scans of the ship. According to the oxidation rate in thehull plating that ship's been sitting down there a lot longer thanthree years. Check the scans yourself. The data also shows that they launched a number of escape podsjust before the crash. I think it would be better if we stay together, sir. Unfortunately, that rules out using the transporter as well.

When I was recalled from Enterprise by the High Command, Ilearned the crew was preparing a 'going-away' party. I found theprospect somewhat frightening. Something wrong? There's someone here. There aren't. There's a space behind this bulkhead. There appears to be a dampening field in this section of theship. I'm reading a power source but I can't pinpoint its location. Is this your vessel? Can you understand me? How long have you been here? These relays are cross-circuited. Efficient, but I'll need to reconnect the Bridge systems. That's not necessary. I can take care of it. Perhaps she can help you then. By the way you keep talking about her you obviously appreciateher technical expertise. So was the female engineer on the Xyrillian ship. I'm simply noting that the last time you found someone thiscompetent you wound up carrying her child. Not at all. Commander Tucker and I were just discussing hisprevious repair experience. No, thank you. I'm going to remove those power shuntson the Bridge. Your computer core? These are optronic relays. Not at all. I've done as much as I can do for now. I need to return toEnterprise to analyse the data. If you'll excuse me. I need to contact my ship. I don't understand."
1172,ENT,episode 18,TUCKER,"I thought Cajun food washot. I bet you'd look good in Triaxian silk. Raw duratanium, dilithium ore. Found what? What'd you find? What are you saying, the ship was haunted? But are your sensors calibrated for ghosts? So far D'Marr'sbatting a thousand. I'm reading duratanium, beryllium and dilithium. Let's get down there. D'Marr didn't say anything about bodies. Captain, we've takenmore damage out here than we ever expected to. There's enoughduratanium down there to patch a lot of hull fractures. According to D'Marr, Engineering should be that way. Aye, Captain. What is it? Rats, maybe? Well, then you probably imagined it. It's nothing to be ashamed of. A spooky ship, a missing crewthings going bump in the night. It'd give anybody the creeps. Yeah, willies. Heebie-jeebies. What, don't you get frightenedevery once in a while? Not by anything? That's too bad. Nothing like a good scare. deleted scene There's got to be something that scares you. Heights, spiders? It's dilithium, all right. Huh. No. The crystals are in perfect shape. Wouldn't be that hard toget this ship flying again. What is it? You said there weren't any biosigns. If you're trying to scare me I appreciate the effort, but Tucker to Captain Archer. We're not alone down here. Why didn't any of this show up on sensors? What's generating it? Then let's do some pinpointing. Hi. Sorry. It's okay, I'm notgoing to hurt you. Hey! T'Pol! Deleted scene I can tell you're surprised to see us. You probably think we'rescavengers. I'll be honest with you, that was pretty much the plan. Butwe didn't know there was anyone here. Believe it or not, we thought youwere ghosts. So you set up this dampening field to hide. Their dilithium matrix is stable. They've got plenty ofantimatter reserves. I think we can get this ship flying. Oh! You startled me. That's twice in one day. You ever sayanything? Unless you're unable to say anything, in which case Iapologize. I'm glad you finally decided to speak up. Thanks. You know a lot about your ship's systems? Well, stick around then. You can warn me about whatever else Ineed to keep my hands off. It's okay. I could use the company. Liana and her father rerouted power where they needed it. Seehere? They shunted helm control to airponics. I'll ask Liana to give you a hand. It'll go faster. She knows the ship's system inside and out. She kept me fromgetting fried on a live plasma feed. What's that supposed to mean? She's very competent. You're never going to let that go, are you. Thanks. Mmm. It's delicious. What is it? I'm not surprised. It's amazing you were able to survive outhere. Why do I feel like it's feeding time at the zoo? Please. I wish more women paid that much attention to me. Well, nearly a third of the crew is female. Earth. I've got lady friends back there, but nobody special, ifthat's what you mean. Not anymore. What about your world? Kantare? Well, as soon as we get your engines fixed you'll be goingback, seeing your friends. I bet you're looking forward to that. We're getting there. I've worked on something like this. On a Xyrillian ship. I can try. I'll need some diagnostic gear from Enterprise. Whydon't you come along? I could buy you lunch. You've been marooned for three years. A change of scenery foran hour or two couldn't hurt. Okay. I'll be back before you know it. Eighty three. Mostly. You met T'Pol. She's a Vulcan. And Doctor Phlox is froma planet called Denobula. Are you kidding? I'd never hear the end of it if I didn'tintroduce you. And there's Porthos, Captain Archer's dog. Oh, I guess you don't have a word for that. He's a mammal. Fourlegs, big ears, kind of cute. Not much. He's the Captain's pet. Well, I hope you'll have some time left for me. So, tell me about Kantare. Our mission's really just getting started. We haven't been tomany planets yet. No idea. That's the fun part. If I had choose right now, I'd say this one. Go ahead. On my way. Billy, could youcontinue this lady's tour? I still owe you lunch. I'll meet you in themess hall. Did T'Pol say something? Sir, I swear I've been nothing but aperfect gentleman. Oh. Strange behaviour? What's going on? They already told us what happened. What kind of an accident? Maybe that data module was damaged during the crash. That doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't Liana have told me? It's Shilat, Captain. I saw him on their ship an hour ago. Alive.Â  Vanilla, huh? Oh, hundreds. I like Rocky Road. I never really thought about it. I guess because it's got nutsin it. It's also got marshmallows but I don't think that's got anythingto do with the name. They're little, er. They're made of sugar, mostly. You know,I'm not sure what they are. Anyway, did you enjoy the tour? I'm sorry. Something important came up. Liana, how long have you been on this planet? I want you to tell me. Because our scans show your ship crashed twenty two years ago. That's what I told Captain Archer. I said there wasn't anyreason for you to lie to us. Is there? We found one of yourescape pods. Liana. There was a body in it. Been dead for a long time. It wasShilat. Can you explain that to me? Tell me what's going on. Is that what you really want? How old were you when your shipcrashed. Five, six? Do you even remember what your home looks like? Where's T'Pol? I'm going to need her help. I'm not doing a thing until I see her. What's so important about this thing? You'd really kill us tokeep it running? I don't care what your big secret is. It doesn't matter ifyou've been here three years or thirty. But you've got to think aboutLiana. We can help you take her home. You got a lot to learn about making friends. That's a pretty neat trick. Here you arewatching me with a gun in your hand while at the same time your corpseis up on the Enterprise. What do you do for an encore? Then why don't you ask them to let me go? Maybe you could tell me how I'm being guarded by a dead man. That's why your father needs to keep thisrunning. You can stop this. Liana, please. If you don't, my friendscould die. Please. They were holograms. She deserves more. And when you're gone? Are you going to let her bury you out in the hills, and livethe rest of her life with these people you created? What if the relaysburn out again? Then she'll really be alone. What if she gets hurt? What do you do then? Programme aholographic doctor? Maybe you have. Ask Liana how she feels. Ask her if justsurviving is enough. How's it going? That was fast. It's a protein resequencer. I figured you must be tired ofeating the same food all the time. I programmed it for makingice-cream. Only five flavours, but they're good ones. You didn't think I'd send you off without Rocky Road. Are you sure you don't want us to stay for a while, lend ahand? So do you. Maybe I'll see you out there."

If we had, it would have let the raiders know where we were. We didn't have much choice. You're very generous, Captain, but our world is over a yearaway. As you say, we've made a home for ourselves. Commander? I hear you've been making progress. There is something else you might be able to help us with. It controls all the ship's vital functions. Environmentalsystems, main power. You might say it keeps us alive. Yes, and the system's beginning to degrade. It could fail atany time. Then you can fix it? Thank you, Commander, but we still have a lot to do here. Another time. Do you need some help? Because of what you found? You were looking where you shouldn't have. Liana. Take their weapons. When the repairs are completed. Go back to your ship. This isn't a negotiation."
1255,ENT,episode 18,SHILAT,Do you needsome help? I thought you were repairing the optronic relays. We don't owe you answers. Get to work. I'm not supposed to leave him.
1256,ENT,episode 18,D'MARR,"Hajjlaran. The warlords on Preenos useit to test their courage. You sure you won't have some? I have other items to trade. I can get you some Triaxian silkfor, say, another protein resequencer? I'm sorry, I prefer to deal in more exotic goods. But, abouttwo days from here there's a small system. You might find what you'relooking for there. It's not inhabited. Not exactly. Mmm! This is excellent. What is it again? Captain, please. This isn't a matter of negotiation. I'mthinking of your safety. It's pure luck that I even found it. A ship, crashed on one of the inner planets. There were nolifesigns aboard, so I landed to claim my rights of salvage. A transport vessel, largely intact. I could have stripped itbare and made a fortune. The, er, crew objected. There weren't. There wasn't anything alive."
1257,ENT,episode 18,MAYA,"The Captain was able to make a crashlanding. It's a miracle we all survived. We were afraid they'd come down and finish what they started. He's busy. Don't bother him, Liana. My daughter has other responsibilities. I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for your father. You know he can't do that. You shouldn't have gone to their ship. I saw the way you looked at their engineer. Are you sure youdidn't say anything? They'll be gone soon and everything will be fine again."
1258,ENT,episode 18,EZRAL,"We're a supply ship. We don't carrylarge weapons. We tried to defend ourselves. Nearly three years. We've tried, believe me. Thank you, Captain. You know why. I think you've met enough of their crew already. Liana. Don't worry about her. You can do it on your own. Do as I say or you'll never see her. You wouldn't understand. Just fix those relays. I've made all the friends I need. You have to get them off the ship. They're gone, Captain. Isn't it obvious? Oh. They didn't seem real to you? I created them. Wasn't easy. Took time. You could touch them. They could make you laugh, surpriseyou. They were our friends, our family for over twenty years. I buried them out in the hills, the ones I could find after thecrash. I killed them, so I buried them. You don't remember. You were a child. We were on our way home,just like Kuulan told you, but we weren't attacked. There was an ionstorm. It overloaded our plasma conduits. I was the chief engineer. Itwas my responsibility to start repairs. But it was worse than Ithought. Leaking plasma burned through the hull. We were losingatmosphere so Captain Kuulan set a course for this planet. They're all dead. Apparently, I didn't do enough. No. It was my decision. She was in our quarters on the lowestdeck. I knew she'd never survive a crash landing down there, so I wentto get her. I left my station. The plasma leak grew, there was an explosion. Half the crew died instantly including my wife. A few made it to theescape pods, but. Why do you think I did this? To retreat into some fantasy? Pretend it never happened? For two years I tried to repair our ship,and I watched my daughter grow up alone. So I decided to bring themback. Her mother first, then Captain Kuulan and the others. I dideverything I could to make it like it was, for her. I've given her everything she needs. She's my daughter. It's not your concern. We've survived here successfully. Thank you, Captain. You have a beautiful ship. May I sit? I haven't been in space for a long time. It feels strange. Good,just a bit strange. I'm fine. No, I'm not. Your engineer is a very plain-spoken man. I've never kept secrets from my daughter. She knows there's moreto see beyond our little oasis. But she's never talked about leaving. Not once. Now your engineer thinks we should just pack up and go. Twenty two years, Captain. I've lived here for twenty two years, andthat ship down there may seem like nothing more than spare parts toyou, but to me it's home. I don't want to leave. I am happy here. Comfortable. But Mister Tucker wants me to believe that I'm beingselfish. He says that now that I have the opportunity to leave, Ishould. That Liana deserves more. Maybe it's time I stopped being soafraid of change. Will you help me take my daughter home? Thank you, Captain, but all we need are these components. I'vegot my own crew to do the work some of them are pretty fair engineers. I saw to that."
1259,ENT,episode 18,LIANA,"Don't touch that. The power's been routed to our living areathrough that relay. It's very dangerous. You're welcome. My father's the engineer. He taught me how things work. Am I interrupting? I thought you might like something to eat. Are you hungry? It's called lorella. We grow it in the airponics bay. Nothing'lltake root outside. I didn't mean to be rude. Do you know a lot of women? What about on, what did you call your planet? What about it? Why can't I go? What's wrong with seeing their ship, meeting some of their crew? These are good people. They want to help us. I promise not tosay anything. How many people are on Enterprise? All humans? Can I meet him? Dog? What does he do? Of course, his pet. I've never seen a dog before. Can we see it? I don't know. It sounds like I'm going to be very busy. Oh, it's boring. I want to hear about the places you've been. Where are you going next? Which planet was your favourite? There are different kinds? That sounds terrible. Why do they call it that? Marshmallows? Very much. I think Sickbay was my favourite. Doctor Phlox let mefeed his bat. He also asked me to lunch. Had I known you were going tobe gone so long. What's wrong? Captain Kuulan told you. Why? Well, your scans must be wrong. I think I should go now. Take me back. I can't. I'm sorry, but I can't. Please take me home. .) You don't have to do this. You're not in any danger here. Can't you just fix our systems and go? This is my home. I didn't tell them anything. Please, just let them leave. That's what you wanted in the firstplace. Make him stop. He'll listen to you. I'm sick of hearing that he's doing thisfor me. I don't believe it anymore. He still should have told them the truth. He can do whatever he wants. He's not like you. You think this is my fault? No, I didn't. Would you wait outside? It's all right. They do what Iask them to. I wish I could. Do you think it's possible to tell a lie so many times that youbegin to believe it's the truth? You can. I never really understoodthat until you came. Remember when you said you thought we were ghosts? In a way, you were right. Yes. They're the only people I've ever known, besides my father,until you've came. That isn't true. They died because of me. Trip, please. Good. We're about to start realigning the antimatter injectors. What's that? Rocky Road? Thank you. You've got a lot more places to go. I'd like that. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Why are we here? To say the least. That's right. I take it you're the man in charge. Military zone? We picked up some unusual energy readings but we had no ideawhere they were coming from. We were simply curious. You might think about putting up a 'no trespassing' sign. Where are we now? Unfortunately. Firsthand. We've been lucky so far. We're eager to get back to Enterprise. If you'll take us to our shuttlepod, we'll be on our way. When's this hearing? I'd like to contact my ship, let them know we're all right. Regulations? So am I. Why don't you get some sleep. I'll take thefirst watch. I'll be right back. How about waiting your turn? I can't believe you'd do this to achild. She's a little young to be a member of the Cabal. I know that you're given genetic tricks as payment. What arethey giving her? Is that so? If that's true, then what are you doing here? It's my fault. I'm the one who kept them here. Where are you taking him? Hello again. I hope isolation wasn't too rough. Actually, I was hoping to find out what's going on around here. I spoke to Colonel Grat, but I get the feeling he's not tellingme the whole story. Archer. My name is Jonathan Archer. They must have tested your DNA, figured out that you haven'tbeen genetically altered. Yes, I did. This is an internment camp. Why did this happen? We're human. Bad news? I'm sorry. Thank you for lunch. Hey! It was just a misunderstanding. I know, I know. it's a big problem with me. I'm just too damncurious. Whenever I meet new people I can't resist trying to get toknow them. I'm certainly getting to know a lot about the Suliban aroundhere. I'll do my best. Unless you have any more advice? I wouldn't know. You'd have to talk to my superiors. What exactly do you want? You've got plenty of Suliban here. Why not ask them? Then why are they in prison? There are families here, children. One man hasn't seen his wifein years. They don't deserve this kind of treatment. Oh, really? Then why not just let them find another place to live? I've met a few Suliban who disagree. Most of the people we meet have beenpretty eager to get to know us but we've had our share of unfortunateencounters. I guess you could say this is one of them. What about you? What did you do before you ended up here? I've got a feeling we could be here for awhile. I don't like being strong-armed, and I don't like what he'sdoing to you and the others. Has anyone every tried to get out of here? Docking bay? What happened? They might have succeeded with a little help from the outside. It won't be long before Enterprise comes looking for Mayweather and me. Have you asked them? How many ships are in that docking bay? What took you so long? More or less. It's not what you think. Are you sure this is a securefrequency? Good. Where are you? Hang on, Trip. We're not ready to leave just yet. Those Suliban you detected areprisoners too, but they're no more guilty than we are. I want to help them get out of here. Have you ever heard of Manzanar, Sub-Commander? It's not a planet. It was an internment camp On Earth during the Second World War. Japanese-American citizens were imprisoned there even though theydidn't do anything wrong. The same thing's happening here. In this case, I'm making an exception. Understood? I've met a Suliban who knows this campinside and out. We've been working on a plan but we're going to needyour help. We'll need a few of your people. Anyone who's had experiencewith particle weapons. Enterprise can handle them. We're not working for the Tandarans. I hope the others were more enthusiastic. Well, he's about this tall, a little on the scrawny side, badteeth. You should check your sensors. They're obviouslymalfunctioning. It's good to see you, Malcolm. This isn't about my rights. It's about theirs. What makes you think they'll join the Cabal? I haven't been here very long but Iseem to know these people a hell of a lot better than you do. Archer to Enterprise. We're on our way. Where are those patrol ships? And the Suliban? Good work. We'll see you in a few minutes. Do I think they'll get out of Tandaran space safely? Yes. Do Ithink they'll be all right? <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

Aft torpedoes. Fire. Take us down. Didthey follow us? You're clear to launch, Commander. He's approaching the compound. Two minutes. Go ahead, Captain. They won't pose a threat. Their vessels are breaking orbit. I'll let him know."
1274,ENT,episode 19,TUCKER,"If it's all the same to you, I'd rather hear that from theCaptain. Keep at it. The thought crossed my mind. So, we just sit on our hands. And what if they're found guilty, sentenced to thirty years inprison? A Vulcan lawyer? They'd be better off getting the electricchair. Never mind. How much longer are theygoing to have to wait? We're not interested in a tour. We just want our people back. How far? All I'm saying is we go take a look for ourselves, make surethey're okay. I'm getting a transporter lock on you now, Captain. Just say the word and we'll bring you both home. If I come in low from the east I should be able to evade theirproximity sensors. It'll be my first target. It's done. Acknowledged. I see it.

It's looks like itsurrounds this entire building. I see something that might be a guardtower but I can't be sure. No, sir. And you are? Does everyone that violates your territory get thrown into aplace like this? If you're worried we're Suliban, trust me, we're not. Three days? They call this a proper meal? I should save it for CommanderTucker. It'd make a good valve sealant. This thing doesn't hold much. I've had plenty, thank you. It was very good. What about the government on the Suliban homeworld? Don't theyhave something to say about this? Writing a letter? Could be valuable someday. People will want to know whathappened here. Then why are you writing it? That's not true. Would you rather spend the rest of your life in prison? Sorry, Captain. What do you care. You might try isolation. Still think we're working with theTandarans? You know, we could have left this place a long time ago ifwe hadn't decided to help you. Why? Because we're not Suliban? Because we look a little toomuch like Tandarans? I'll admit, when I first came here it wasn't easyto see past my preconceptions about the Suliban, but I did. Why can'tyou? Yes? Who are you? Malcolm? Long story. How'd you get down here? Are you sure you weren't detected? They're in place. Are you up for this? Good luck. Major, do you have a second? I don't mean to cause any trouble,but I was wondering if it might be possible to get some better food. Nooffence, but the meals here are pretty awful. I'll try, but I'm not sure I can hold down another bowl of thatwhat do you call it? It tastes like sawdust. Is that what they make youeat? Because if it is, I'd think about going on a hunger strike. Idon't know how you. I'll go. Come on. Captain, think they'll make it?"

Unless you want to join him, do as I say. Colonel Grat wants to see you. Just him. Get out there. If this happens again you'll all be spending time in isolation. Eat what you're given. Enough!"
1363,ENT,episode 19,GRAT,"Thank you, Major. Please, sit down. I canunderstand why you're upset. No doubt you've had a difficult afternoon. I meant to speak to you earlier, but I had some urgent businessto attend to. I apologise. We don't see many starship captains here. Jonathan Archer. You must be Travis Mayweather. I am Colonel Grat. I took the liberty to examine the database in your shuttlecraft,so I know that you're from a planet called Earth and that you serve ona vessel called Enterprise. What I don't know is what you were doingwithin our military zone. You entered orbit of our second moon. You must have detected it. Your curiosity almost got you killed. Fortunately, our patrolship didn't vaporise your shuttlecraft. I'll pass that along. This is a detention complex. It's several light years from wherewe found you. We're at war with a species that can mimic the appearance ofalmost any humanoid. We had to make certain that you weren'tinfiltrators. I know. We've already tested your DNA. You're familiar with theCabal? Then you must know about their genetic enhancements and howdangerous they can be. I hope you didn't suffer too many casualties. I'm afraid I don't have the authority to release you. We havevery strict regulations. You'll have to appear before a magistrate onTandar Prime. But the hearing should be brief. I'll explain that thiswas just an innocent misunderstanding. A transport will be here in three days. I wish I could offer you more comfortable accommodations. Unfortunately, this detention complex is overcrowded at the moment. Iwould advise you to keep to yourselves. If the Suliban give you anytrouble, simply tell one of the guards. I can't permit that, Captain. But I will call them personally and explain the situation. Escort these gentlemen back to theirquarters. Make sure they get a proper meal. I'm sorry we couldn't havemet under better circumstances. I'm sorry, but regulations forbid that. There'snothing to be concerned about. They've been placed in comfortablequarters and they're perfectly safe. I'm afraid that's not possible. Of course. They're also free to choose their own counsel. When you arrive at Tandar Prime you'll be contacted by the CentralMagistrate's Office. I'm sending them now. Good luck to you. I understand you were out after curfew lastnight, arguing with a Suliban. You should have my advice, Captain. I admire your spirit of exploration, but in this case it couldget you into trouble. Keep to yourself. No, but I do have a question. Have you ever been to Oklahoma? Iguess you could say I'm a curious man myself. After you mentioned thatyou were familiar with the Cabal I decided to speak with ourintelligence agency. They've uncovered some interesting facts. Apparently two Suliban soldiers crash-landed near a town called BrokenBow, Oklahoma. They were chasing a Klingon, of all things. I waswondering if you could provide some insight into what they were doingthere. Oh, I think you know a great deal. Enterprise took the Klingonback to his homeworld. Isn't that right? Rigel Ten. You made a detourthere. From what I'm told, you contacted a woman named Sarin. Youremember her? Well, I'll remind you. She was the head of a Sulibanresistance cell. She was killed by the Cabal in a firefight at thetrade complex. Several of our people saw you there, Captain. I believeyou were injured, a shot in the leg. Do I have to ask your superiorsabout that as well? Information. What do you know about the Cabal? What geneticenhancements you've seen, Helix deployments. Who's giving them theirorders? We both know they wouldn't be very helpful. That's a discussion for another time. Tell me what you know. They're here for their own protection. The last thing we wanted to do was build these detention centres,but we had no choice. When the Cabal began their activities there was agreat deal of fear among the Tandarans. There were instances ofviolence. Fourteen innocent Suliban were killed in one day alone. Wehad to find a way to keep them out of danger. They wouldn't get very far. It's ironic, but once they're out ofTandaran territory the Cabal will hunt them down and turn them all intosoldiers. They're better off here. One of the Cabal leaders is a man named Silik. He infiltratedyour vessel approximately three months ago posing as a Borothanpilgrim. What did he want? Did he speak of the Temporal Cold War? Answer me! This conversation is takinglonger than I expected. I'd hate to see you miss that transporttomorrow morning. The next one won't arrive for another sixty days. I'm afraid the hearing'sbeen postponed. The magistrate assigned to their case is in themiddle of a very complex proceeding and it's taking more time than heexpected. Hopefully not more than a few days. If you stayon course for Tandar Prime I'll arrange for an ambassador to show youour capital city when you arrive. I'm doing everything I can. Try to be patient. You'll hear from me soon. Have you had a chance to reconsider? I'mwilling to compromise, Captain. Just tell me what you know about Silik. If you're unwilling to discuss the Suliban, maybe you can help mewith something else. We detected some unusual energy readings lastnight. At first we thought it was random interference, but afterexamining the readings more closely we discovered they were coming fromyour quarters. I'm told they're working perfectly. We found this in Ensign Mayweather'spocket but he wouldn't say how it got there. I was hoping you could tell me. Take him to isolation. You seem to be off-course. I thought you were headed forTandar Prime. What brings you here? If you're thinking about trying tocircumvent our legal system I advise against it. You come any closer to our planet andmy patrol ships will open fire. They'll have a weapons lock on your vessel inless than one minute. What? You have forty five seconds to leave orbit. You'rejamming our frequencies. Break off your transmission now. I'm not going to warn you again. End your transmission and leave orbit. You have no idea what you've done. You haven't freed thesepeople, you've condemned them. You had no right to interfere. They have no rights. They lost them the moment the Cabal beganattacking us. Do you know how many people the Cabal have murdered? Howmany ships they destroyed? Colonies? You just gave them eighty nine newsoldiers! These people have nothing left. They're desperate. They'll neverbe able to resist what the Cabal has to offer."
1364,ENT,episode 19,NARRA,More? You look like Tandarans. I won't. Father! My father's back at the common area. He needs help. Please.
1365,ENT,episode 19,DANIK,"Do what? You don't know what you're talking about. I don't know who you are, but you're wrong about us. We're not genetically enhanced and we're not members of theCabal. Didn't Colonel Grat tell you? We're dangerous. All Suliban aredangerous. We were just on our way back. Klev, please. Will you make sure she gets back? I'll see you inthe morning. Don't worry. It gets very cold in there at night. Sometimes I wish I wasgenetically enhanced. If you've come to apologize, don't. It was just amisunderstanding. Maybe you should talk to one of the Tandarans. Why don't you go and find your friends? And don't forget curfew. We're not criminals, Captain, and we're not soldiers. The onlything we're guilty of is being Suliban. As far as they're concerned, that doesn't mean anything. Youbelieved I was a member of the Cabal, didn't you? Didn't you? All that seems to matter is the way we look. 'Be careful oftheir wicked smiles, their shining yellow eyes. At night, they'llsqueeze right through your door and everybody dies.' The Tandaranchildren used to tease my daughter with that nursery rhyme. At leasthere, she doesn't have to hear it anymore. Detention Complex twenty six. I've heardit's one of their nicer ones. The Cabal began their attacks eight years ago. It wasn't longbefore the Tandarans started to question the loyalty of all Sulibanliving in their territory. We were rounded up, relocated as they liketo say. They told us it was only temporary. It was for our own safety.'Once the Cabal has been destroyed, you will be free to go back to yourhomes.' We're still waiting. There are eighty nine of us here. Thousands more in other camps. Everyone of us used to be citizens onworlds in the Tandar Sector. Did you know that I was born in the sametown as one of the guards? Major Klev. I was friends with his brotherwhen we were growing up. I'm sure they would if they still existed. Our homeworld becameuninhabitable three hundred years ago. Most Suliban are nomadic, butsome of us have assimilated into other cultures. My grandfather madethe unfortunate decision to settle on Tandar Prime. Yes? It's all right. I asked them. Sajen, you're being rude. It's my wife. We were separated during the relocation. She's inone of the other camps. Her transfer was rejected again. She tried toappeal their decision, but as usual, they wouldn't listen. Midday inspection. Try to look your best. Thank you for listening. Maybe I was tired of talking to you. I've lived with Tandarans all my life. They're decent people,for the most part. I was director of research at an engineering institute. It's inthe Querella Province. You should see it, assuming your hearing goeswell. Why not tell Grat what you know, get yourself out of here. You mean escape? A couple of years ago three men pried open oneof the security grates. They tried to get to the docking bay. Yes. It's about a hundred metres away. It's where they keepSuliban ships they've impounded. Oh, they managed to get inside but before they could reach avessel all three of them were killed. Colonel Grat made a ridiculousclaim that they were armed. I appreciate the offer, Captain, but I doubt many people herewould be willing to take the risk. And even if we did get to the ships and managed to lift off,there are patrol vessels in the area. All we have to do is get out of Tandaran territory. After that,we can set a course for the Niburon colonies. I know some people there. They might be willing to help us. We're getting out of here, Sajen. This is the wall that I was telling youabout. It's only forty metres from the docking bay. The isolation block is here. He's in one of these cells. The charges? Nightly inspection. I'd better get back. See you in orbit. Hurry. Go with the others. I'll be there soon, Narra. Go. Go!"
1366,ENT,episode 19,SAJEN,"What are they doing here? This came today. What species are you? Never heard of them. Why did you bring them here? They could be working with Grat. It's a journal. I doubt anyone will ever read this. Why do you care? I see how you look at us. Suliban terrify you. You wouldn't be surprised if I slithered up this wall or turned my faceinside out. Cabal, Suliban, it's all the same to you. We won't make it ten metres outside the complex before we'reshot, like the others. And once we've made this miraculous escape, where do you expectus to go? It's too dangerous. You're placing a lot of trust in people you've only known forthree days. For all we know they've been planted here to stage thisrevolt so Grat would finally have a reason to kill all of us. Think of your daughter. Are you willing to risk her life, too? I'm not going to help you plan our suicide. What happened to you? Danik's been looking for your Captain. Have you seen him? I never asked for your help. No, wait."

We might need a translator. Those subtitles go by pretty fast. Two and a half hours? Seems awfully long for a movie about four men in a truck. You promised me explosions. This is all wrong. Excuse me. Reed to Bridge. We're trying to watch a movie down here but instead, we're beingtreated to a view of you. So unless you're planning on giving us alittle song and dance, maybe you could see what's gone wrong. Captain. Careful. She's alive. Captain! This thing appears to be growing. There's notelling if it'll get out of the cargo bay. I recommend we evacuate theentire deck. You think they left us a little souvenir? You didn't see that thing go after the Captain! It seemed hostileenough to me. Do you think that's wise, Doctor? With all due respect, Hoshi, we're not talking about nouns andverbs here. It could take you days to learn a language like that, evenif it is one. None that I could tell. It'll take a few minutes. Bridge, something's wrong. Doctor? Off. Understood. There must be some way to cut them out of there. The end result's the same. If that thing continues to grow, we're goingto have to find a way to contain it. Starfleet's been working on creating a stable EM barrier for thelast five years. Right. They just haven't found a way to control the particledensity. All the specs are in the database. I've been trying tojerry-rig a prototype of my own. I've got it stable enough to absorb a phase pistol blast sixtypercent of the time. I think I can improve on that. How's our little friend? But it's alive? Good. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to run a few tests of myown. I need to determine how much bioelectric stress it can tolerate. I'm trying to create a force field to isolate the cargo bay, butif it's going to work, I have to calculate how much of a jolt it willtake to repel the organism without killing it or any of the people it'staken. Why not? Intelligent being or not, its big brother is in the Cargo baystrangling the Captain and four other crewmen. If we don't do somethingto contain it now it could pose a threat to everyone on board. Such as? How long would that take? In less than an hour that thing could spread across half a deck. Not if they're trying to kill the Captain. I admire your interspecies ethics, but until Hoshi tells me she'sfound a way to communicate with it, I have to assume its intentions arehostile. Now, if you don't mind. I'm sure I don't have to remind you, Doctor, I am the rankingofficer here. The Captain is in no condition to offer an opinion. Fine. Your rules, but we'd better get to it. The particle density's still fluctuating. I think the problem'sin the lower left quadrant. Try again. Better. Go ahead. I'm making the final calibrations now. Understood. {Cargo bay two] Emitter B's off by three point two microns. The forcefield's working, but I can'tguarantee how long it will hold. Have you done it? It just sounds like a constant tone.

I simply noted that linguistic matters fall within yourresponsibility. For all we know it was Mister Tucker's table mannersthat offended them. There's no need to react emotionally. Try to learn from failure. It could help your next first contact be more successful. Yes. Now might not be the best time. Our encounter didn't go well but I doubt we gave them reason toattack us. We're not even certain that the organism's hostile. We'll need to communicate with them better than last time. T'Pol to Doctor Phlox. Report. Yes. Stand by. Doctor? I'm sorry, Ensign, there isn't enough time. We need to neutralise it, quickly. You said phase pistols had noeffect? Then I suggest you find a method that does. Can you assemble some EM emitters? What happened? Mister Reed, withdraw your team. You wanted a chance to communicate. I suggest youbegin. How much time do they have? Do you have a suggestion? A force field. And? I suggest you work quickly. Where? Lay in a course. Let me know as soon as they respond. Any progress? The situation requires expertise, not luck. If you don't, no one else aboard Enterprise does. It was your suggestion that we attempt to communicate with it. If you don't think that's possible, we'll have to find anothersolution. Mathematics is sometimes considered a form of language. Perhaps I can assist you. What if we used a bilateral algorithm? Did you compensate for frequency drift? Allowing your emotions to control you won't help solve thisproblem, Ensign. You asked for my help. As First Officer it's my duty to supervise you. It's my job. On the contrary. It would be a great loss to Starfleet if youwere not a part of this crew. If you feel I've been unfair to you, Iapologise, but I hold you to a high standard, Ensign, because I knowyou're capable of achieving it. Shall we continue? Any code can be broken. Go ahead. Understood. T'Pol to Lieutenant Reed. We've made some progress on the translation, but we'regoing to need to get into the cargo bay to test it. Is the forcefieldready? You'll have to do it quickly. Doctor Phlox says our peopledon't have much time. We're about to find out. Ask what it wants. What's it saying? Ensign. The Kreetassans already gave them to us. Tell it we're taking it back. Lower the force field. Lieutenant. Here. Not them, it. This is all one organism."

How's his mood? I'll take my chances. Prime rib tonight with real horseradish. I can't wait. In the meantime, why don't we shoot a little nineball? You can break. I was going to save this for a rainy day, but Stanford versus Texas. Fresh out of the subspace mailbag. You've been threatening toteach me the finer points of the game. Unlessyou're too busy with your brown dwarves. How deep's the pool? I didn't know it was such a rough game. And I thought it was just a bunch of guys screwing around in apool. Did you see the way number twelve set him up? Wait, he's calledthe point man, right? Well, I'll still take a great off-tackle run out of thebackfield, but I can see how you can get hooked on this. My pleasure. Now keep watching while Texas trounces your sorryCalifornia butts. Of course not. What the hell was that? Is that fair? It gives you guys an advantage. I wouldn't want to be taking a swim if the gravity plating wentoffline. Sir? Get out of here! Go! Take it easy. Zabel's still unconscious. The Texas goalie can't block to his rightbecause he keeps his hands too deep. We got to get out! This thing's gotten inside our heads! Now's not the time to be thinking about the regionals. Senior year, North American regionals against Princeton. We, Imean, you were down by two goals under a minute left. You thought you could win every game. You always thought youcould win. No matter how far behind you were. Captain. I feel you've drifted away over there. He's out. When Zephram Cochrane talked about new life and newcivilisation do you think this is what he meant?

You'll note that even though it's been severed fromits body, it survives independently Not unlike thecommon earthworm or the Neethian cradlefish. Possibly not, butI'm going to need a tissue sample if I hope to learn more about itsphysiology. That'll bequite enough. This is no earthworm. Look at the synaptic activity. This organism possesses avery sophisticated nervous system. It could be capable of higher mentalfunctions. If I may, the organism is highly photo-sensitive. Asustained burst of EM radiation might be enough to stun the creature. It's working. Shut off the emitters. Shut them off. Their nervous systems appear to be linked to the organism's. They're sharing autonomic functions, neural impulses. If we continuefiring we could end up killing our own people. The rate of symbiosis is increasing. If wedon't find a way to extract them soon their systems will be toointegrated with the creature. I won't be able to separate them. A few hours at most. Their metabolic rates are dropping. Temperature, respiration. I'm not sure if you appreciate how alien this creature is. It'snot attacking our crewmen, it's trying to integrate them into itself. At some point in the very near future there won't be sixlifeforms in that cargo bay. There'll only be one. Fast asleep. It appears to have entered a dormant state. Probably a reaction to the shock of being severed from the largerorganism. Very much so. What kind of tests? May I ask why? If you intend to pummel this appendage with EM radiation untilit cries for mercy, I'm afraid I can't permit that. This is more than just a severed limb. It exhibits all the signsof an intelligent being. There are less invasive ways to gather the information you need. Microcellular analysis. Less than an hour. I'm willing to help you, Mister Reed, but not if it meanstorturing this organism. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't our missionto try to better understand unique forms of life? We don't know anything about this creature's intentions. If you want information to help you construct your force field,you'll acquire it under my supervision. Not in my Sickbay, unless the Captain says otherwise. Precisely. Phlox to T'Pol. I know you're under a great deal of pressure But Crewman Kelly's metabolic rate hasdropped to a critical level. Whatever you're planning to do You'd better do it soon. Commander Tucker's heart rate is increasing. Good. Crewman Kelly's biosigns are stabilising as well. Medical Team, report to Cargo bay two. Hard to say. When it got separated from itself, perhaps itneeded a physical connection with any lifeform it could find. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

Does anybody hear that? Frequency distortions mixed in with the static. It's coming from the comm. system. Twice. I guess today is just not my day. Slowly. Hwajat, their word for eat. With the emphasis on the first syllable, hwa-jat, it means tomate. Context is critical in every language but Kreetassan has themost subtle variations I've ever seen. The same word can have a dozendifferent meanings. You think it was my fault? You implied it. But you think if I picked up the language faster they might havenot stormed off the ship. Thanks. Commander, I'm picking upsome kind of interference from the comm. system. A high-frequencydistortion. Mostly just irritating. Thanks. No, thanks. I'm turning in early. I've had enough language problems for one day. How did it get onboard? I'll do my best. If it's intelligent maybe we can communicate with it. Thefrequency distortions, they look a lot like the phonetic patterns incertain Andorian dialects. What other choice do we have? Give me a chance. Sub-Commander. Believe me, you'd be the first to know. I'm sorry. It'sfrustrating. I'm not having a lot of luck. Maybe I don't have the expertise. I'm doing my best. I've made a little progress, but our translation matrix isn'tdesigned for this. Look at it. It's more like a calculus equation thana language. What I'm trying to say is that I could use help from someonewith a background in higher mathematics. I already tried. I wouldn't be much of a comm. officer if I didn't. Neither will questioning everything I do. I didn't ask for you to keep count of every time I make amistake, or to second-guess all of my decisions. This goes beyond duty, Sub-Commander. You've been looking overmy shoulder ever since you came on board. Double-checking my logentries, my translations. Is that all we're talking about? You don't think I belong onEnterprise, do you. Yes. Why don't we take another look at the sub-harmonics. I wasthinking we could run it through the decryption matrix, see if we canfind a pattern. All I see is numbers, codes. Here, here it is. I found a third set ofrepetitions. Try it. Just a few more and the UT can start building asyntax. I'm going to create distortions in the tone. Hopefully, theorganism will understand what I'm trying to do. Come on, just alittle more. I think I've got enough to try something simple. It's talking to us. Hold on. It's giving us coordinates.

There'an alien organism on our ship. It came aboard around the same time we saw you. We were hopingyou might know something about it. Well, it's big, but it didn't start out that way. It's like alarge mass of tendrils. Like a giant web, but it moves and grows. Where? Can you tell us where this planet is? Excuse me? That's the thing. We don't know what we did to offend you. You mean eat. I don't understand. We were just eating. How do you eat? I see. Okay. Please believe me, we had no idea that would beoffensive to you. It was simply a misunderstanding.

And you think that we need our tensions eased? We've all gone about ten months without a break. I think it'snormal for people to get a little sloppy. Is it populated? Don't say she didn't warn you. I think I'm going to pass. Nobody needs this as much as you do. The ship will be nice andquiet. I've got some astrometric surveys that have been piling up. It'll be a good chance to get some work done. You think I need a massage? I suppose I could read those surveys on a nice beach. Transfer it to my Ready room. If you don't mind my asking, Admiral, why is this our problem? Do they expect us to take her all the way back to Vulcan? Any idea what the emergency is? Imagine that. Hoshi, thanks forgiving up your cabin. Everything set? Don't address the ambassador unless spoken to first. Don't offer to shake hands. Refrain from laughing in her presence. You seem to be pulling out all the stops. Well, she'll be here soon enough. Let me know if you need anyhelp. Someone's in a hurry. I'm Jonathan Archer. That's why we're here. If you'll transmit your landingcoordinates to us, we'll send down a shuttlepod. I'm looking forwardto the visit. They said it was important we pick up the ambassador as quicklyas possible. They didn't say why. Ambassador. On behalf of my crew I'd like to welcome you aboardEnterprise. May I take that? This is Commander Charles Tucker, my Chief Engineer. And this is my Science Officer, Sub-Commander T'Pol. I hope you like your quarters, Ambassador. T'Pol tried very hard to anticipate your needs. T'Pol tells me you negotiated the first territorial accordsbetween Vulcan and Andoria. T'Pol. Of course not. T'Pol. Is there a problem I should be aware of? You were a bit abrupt with her. I don't pretend to understand Vulcans. I never have. But Iwouldn't be a very good captain if I didn't know when something wasbothering my science officer. Uncommon, but not unheard of. We don't know what she's done. You seem to know a lot about her. Was it worth the trip? I've had a few heroes in my life. It's never easy when one ofthem lets you down. No, I'm sure they don't. On my way. Let's find out who they are. What can we do for you? We weren't told. What's the change of plans? Your magistrate seemed in a big hurry to get rid of her. Now hewants her back? I'll have to contact my superiors. I'm just a starship captain. You don't think they'd trust me tomake these kinds of decisions on my own? Get me Starfleet Command. Just a transport captain. Polarise the hull plating. What the hell is he doing? Hail him. Aft torpedoes. Return fire. Would the phase cannons be more effective? What do you mean, we can't fire them at warp? Drop to impulse. Deploy the aft cannon. Fire. See what you can do about their engines. Resume course, warp four. Any idea what that was all about? Well, Ithink we know someone who might. We were asked to pick you up and deliveryou to a Vulcan ship. No one said anything about getting shot at. Then who sent them? How much greater could it get? A few more volleys from thatship would have ruptured our hull. So am I. You're leaving me no choice, Ambassador. Archer toMayweather. Change of plans, Travis. Lay in a course back to Mazar. You heard me. It's more than two days to the rendezvous point, and therecould be other hostile ships tracking us. Unless you can convince mewhy it's worth risking all our lives. You could always order me to take her to the rendezvous point. They certainly considered the repercussions. They knew someonewas after her. Why risk one of your own ships when you can risk one ofours? They're doing it to us again, Admiral. Keeping us in the dark. I've tried. I don't even know what the charges against her are. Come in. Something wrong? Go on. Any luck? I don't doubt that, but it doesn't affect my decision. She told you that? Which is? I'm sorry T'Pol, but I'm going to need more than that. By who? But you believed her? Why? It happens all the time. You're asking me to put the lives of everyone on board injeopardy based on your talking to this woman for a couple of hours. Why didn't we see them coming? And go three against one? You're familiar with theMazarites. What's their top speed? Then let's give them a run for their money. Travis, increasespeed to warp four point eight. Archer to Engineering. Keep shovelling. We're going to four point nine. Let's celebrate later. Travis. How far to the rendezvous point? Can we get a message through to the Vulcans? Keep trying. That Vulcan ship better not be late. We're being chased by three Mazarite ships. I'm not sure. You still haven't told me what this mission is. You hadn't even met us. And a century of good behaviour hasn't changed your mind? And that would include you. And that job fell to you? Why couldn't you tell us? And the story of you being recalled in disgrace? Obviously, it didn't work. I appreciate you telling me the truth. It hasn't gotten to that yet. If you've learned anything about humans, you'd know we don'talways take the most logical course of action. What's our status? Open a channel. What do you want? So are yours. I have a better idea. Why don't you slow down before yourengines explode? I've been ordered to deliver her safely to the Vulcans, andthat's exactly what I plan to do. Archer to Engineering. Sorry Trip, but we need a little more speed. It's called a warp five engine. We don't have any choice, Trip. Ambassador. Warp five. How far to the Vulcan ship? Then use their last known position and do the math. Take aguess. What if we could get a message through? Tell them to get hereas fast as they can. Hoshi, any way you can get a message through the interference? If we do get a message through to the Vulcans, we don't wantthe Mazarites to see them coming. See what you can do. Hoshi? Go ahead. Hoshi? How long? How long now? I thought it was down to eight. We just need to buy ten more minutes. I want you to go to Sickbay. I'll explain later. If there was ever a time to start trustingus, this would be it. Put him through. You know, I honestly didn't think you'd be able to catch us. Just out of curiosity, how fast do your ships go? That could be a problem. Our shuttlebay was damaged, thanks toyou. I doubt we could launch a shuttlepod until it's repaired. What,what would you have topped out at? Warp five point five? Warp six? Ican't imagine that you can do much more than that. It seemed like yourengines were starting to run pretty hot. Malcolm, I'm counting on you. T'Pol. Okay. Your last attack blew out systems across half the ship. Power'sdown in Engineering. A plasma conduit exploded on E deck. I was getting to that. Her quarters are on E deck. She was nomore than ten metres away when the conduit blew. This is Doctor Phlox. I imagine they have their hands full right about now. I believe that's the Sh'Raan. She's a Vulcan combat cruiser. One oftheir most powerful, if I'm not mistaken. Put it up. You could say that. Thank you. Occupational hazard? We're glad we could help. Goodbye, Ambassador."

Well, I'm certainly up for meeting some new people. I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping for something more thana linguistic seminar. Captain, can you come to the Bridge? They're charging weapons. Port hull plating's offline. No effect. They're using some kind of energy shielding. Undoubtedly, but we can't fire them at warp. Particle discharge, sir. It would destabilize our warp field andmost likely blow out both our nacelles. I've been working on theproblem, but I haven't quite I've got a lock. Their shields are failing. They're dead in the water, sir. Replacing power couplings? Hardly. If you must know, I much prefer the shooting back part. I need something to do on this ship, Commander. Then I'd say Starfleet needs to make its presence known on Risa. Any good restaurants? I imagine that's quite good for the skin. Three ships coming up fast. Our Mazarite friends, sir, and they'vebrought company. We could drop to impulse, use the phase cannons. They're closing to twenty thousand kilometres. Fifteen. They're holding at four point nine, sir. I don't believe they can either, sir. They're releasing driveplasma to keep their warp coils from overloading. They're re-entering weapons range, sir. They're matching our speed. They're still gaining on us. The Mazarites will be in firing range long before then. We could try deflecting their jamming signal, sir. Use it toblind their sensors as well. Aye, sir. That's a direct hit to our starboard nacelle. We can't hold off those ships for that long."

It's my understanding that your mating ritual is effective ineasing tension. Efficiency's down three percent. Perhaps it's time the crew takes shore leave. I took the liberty of locating a suitable planet approximatelynine days from our present location. It's called Risa. It's tropical, with an abundance of pristine beaches. You'llfind more information in the Vulcan database. Yes, by a humanoid culture receptive to easing tension. If you're wearing that to impress the women on Risa, you may aswell stay on board. Mister Tucker has a point. The safety of this ship depends on its captain being at his mostefficient. Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Thank you for volunteering your quarters. I imagine she'll spend most of the journey alone, engaged inmeditation, but if it seems appropriate I'll ask if she'll meet withyou. If you wouldn't mind taking that. Ambassador V'Lar is accustomed to a Spartan environment. I believe so. I've prepared this to familiarize the crew withthe necessary protocols. We should assign a stewardto attend to her needs. Those guidelines are largely precautionary. I doubt the crewwill have much opportunity to interact with her. I'm simply following the protocols used in dealing with anambassador of V'Lar's distinction. Thank you, Captain. T'nar pahk sarat y'rani. The odour. The human scent is difficult to mask. I hope, Ambassador, that you regard the charges against you withless levity. How do you intend to defend yourself? Are you saying you're guilty? Another time, perhaps. This is your cabin. I'll say good night. You presume that my time with humans has left me susceptible totheir emotions. If you're sensing anything from me, it isn't anger. Good night, Ambassador. Captain. I assume you're talking about Ambassador V'Lar. If you believe I was rude, I'll convey my apologies. It's uncommon for a Vulcan to commit a crime. Unheard of for a person in Ambassador V'Lar's position. It doesn't matter. If she were innocent, she would have insistedon staying to defend herself. I've met the ambassador before, though she clearly doesn'trecall. It was many years ago on Vulcan during my early schooling. Shehad just negotiated the Treaty of Ka'Tann and I travelled a greatdistance to see her. The ambassador inspired me to choose a direction in my own life. A path that led me to the Science Council, and eventually here. Vulcans don't have heroes. Direct hit to Engineering, subsection 12. We've taken damage. You have no idea who they were? Ambassador, we're here at the request of the Vulcan HighCommand. It would be illogical for you to withhold information from us. I hope I'm not interrupting. If you need anything, it can be brought to you. I don't care for it. It was the Captain that I wanted to speak to you about. He deserves to be told the truth. You can make things easier for him. The High Command hasrequested his assistance. It doesn't seem unreasonable to ask why. Yes. He's resentful. He believes we held back their development of warp technology. But situations like this only reinforce their resentment. If weexpect to continue our relations with humanity we have to earn theirtrust. I meant no insult. You remember. I apologise if I acted inappropriately. I took the liberty of speaking with Ambassador V'Lar. The ambassador and I spent the last two hours talking. She'seven more remarkable than her reputation suggests. I believe it should. She's not guilty of the crime she's beenaccused of. The charges were fabricated to get her off Mazar and divertattention from her actual mission. She can't reveal that, but she's convinced me that it's criticalwe help her accomplish it. She also told me that if we return her to Mazar she'll bekilled. She wouldn't tell me. Yes. I can't accept that she'd sacrifice a lifetime ofaccomplishments with an act of criminal misconduct. Not to her. We must take her to the Sh'Raan. Captain, since I've served aboard Enterprise I've never askedyou for anything. I'm asking for this now. Don't return the ambassadorto Mazar. Please. Thank you. Yes. A Minshara class planet with three moons. Its gravity isapproximately equal to Earth's sea level. I wouldn't know. I'm told there are. It's all in the database. I meditated in an isolation chamber filled with warm alluvialmud. Polarise the hull plating. Captain, report to the Bridge. They're targeting our engines. Comparable to Starfleet. I don't believe they've exceeded warpfive. They're matching our speed and accelerating. Warp four pointnine. Captain, report to the Bridge. Holding at warp four point nine, but Commander Tucker doesn'tbelieve we can sustain it for more than another ten minutes. Their jamming signal is disrupting our sensors as well. If we could maintain our present speed, approximately fiftythree minutes. The Sh'Raan is capable of warp seven. If we could maintain warpfive we'd reach them in twelve minutes. Wouldn't they respond? Eight minutes. If they received our message, another ten minutes. That was before we dropped out of warp. Her injuries are extensive. Plasma burns, neurological trauma."
1492,ENT,episode 21,TUCKER,"Excuse me? Those regulations don't apply to you. Have you been suffering? That's a hell of a dry spell. That hasn't always been my experience. Well, I like the sound of that. What's your idea of suitable? Rule number one, you've got to be seen to get noticed. And Iplan on getting noticed. Figured out your itinerary yet? Captain, you need this as much as I do. We're going to a planet with over two hundred registered Nuvianmasseuses and you're going to sit in your cabin with a bunch of starcharts? Pleased to meet you. That was over ninety years ago. How long have you been adiplomat? Well, I wasn't, er, I, er, didn't mean to imply that you were,er You really enjoy this, don't you.

Just in case anyone's keeping track, I believe that'll be aStarfleet record. Please tell me you're ready to slow down. I don't know how much more I can give you. On paper. Aye, sir. Don't take your eyes off that antimatterstream. Tucker to the Bridge! The port injectors just blew! We've got to slow down, Captain!"

The magistrate feels that we let theambassador go too quickly. She's needed for additional questioning. Wedon't want to cause you any more inconvenience. If you'll drop out ofwarp, we can dock with you and take the ambassador aboard our ship. I'm just a transport captain. I never try tomake sense of what government bureaucrats are thinking. There's really no need. We'll wait for you to confirm whatever youhave to. Captain. Ambassador. Just giving you a friendly warning. Are youaware that your engines are overheating? We have no quarrel with you. Give us theVulcan and you'll be free to go. Why would you risk the lives of your crew forthis criminal? Give us the Vulcan. Put her on a shuttle and bring her to our leadvessel. Prepare to be boarded. Where is she? I didn't ask for a damage report. Where is she? I want to see her. The Vulcan? Open it. Open it. Yes? What's causing it? Report. Answer me, what'sgoing on? We did what we came to do. That's all that matters."

1589,ENT,episode 21,OFFICIAL,Captain Archer? Are you prepared to receive Ambassador V'Lar? I regret there won't be time for that. Theambassador is already on her way to your ship. I assume the Vulcans have informed you of theurgency of this matter. V'Lar has been expelled for abuse of herposition and criminal misconduct.
1590,ENT,episode 21,V'LAR,"Captain Archer? Thank you. That's very thoughtful, Captain. The pleasure is mine, Commander. T'nar jaral. But please, I've been anticipating the opportunityto practice my English. Fortunately my needs are few, Captain. I am curious, though. Whopreviously occupied the cabin? Actually, I was hoping to meet the crew member in order to thankher for allowing me to disrupt her routine. I prefer not toinconvenience anyone if possible. That philosophy has served me well inthe diplomatic service. The Andorians required a somewhat firmer hand at the negotiatingtable. But I was younger then. That was before we even made contactwith Earth. Commander Tucker, I understood that on your world it isconsidered bad manners to ask a lady her age. Forgive me, Commander. My attempt at humour. Suffice it to saythat with T'Pol and myself here, you're almost certainly dining withthe two oldest people on this ship. Of course I do. There is no defence. It's all right, Captain. A person in my position carries thetrust of all Vulcans. The fact that the Mazarites believe that trusthas been compromised justifies T'Pol's concern. I'm afraid my age isbetraying me, Captain. Would you mind if I retired? I've never been to Earth, but I find thehumans I have encountered quite unpredictable. I'd be interested inhearing about your experiences there. I understand. T'Pol. I sense your anger. They're our emotions as well. We simply hide them better. No. Disappointment. Obviously they weren't sent by the council on Mazar. I have no answers for you. There are diplomatic matters at stake here which do not concernyou. To tell you any more would only put your ship and your crew atgreater risk. I'm sorry, Captain. You're under strict orders to transport me to the Sh'Raan. Not at all. I was wondering why they were so sparsely decorated. I don't want to be waited on. And since I doubt I'll betravelling to Earth any time soon, I decided to spend a little timewith my hosts. Thank you for the use of your quarters. You'll have themback soon enough. Pash tah. Have you tried iced tea? Captain Archer certainly does. It's flavoured with passionfruit. An appropriate ingredient for him, don't you think? He's a most intriguing man. Will you join me? Please. We'll be back atMazar in a few hours. I'd prefer not to waste that time alone. Thismust be awkward for you, having a foot in two worlds. Loyal to yourCaptain, yet still a Vulcan. You believe Captain Archer can be trusted? Even though he clearly doesn't trust us? Why? We've kept many things from them, all for good reason. I would not have succeeded at my career for ninety four yearswithout earning people's trust. Of course not. You were simply speaking your mind, as you alwayshave. It was at Vulcana Regar, wasn't it? During the second Ka'Tannconference, you approached me during a recess. You were not easy to forget. Your questions about my negotiatingtactics were quite presumptuous coming from one so young. Not at all. In fact, your bluntness made me reconsider some ofmy positions, much as it has now. T'Pol, I have something to tell you. Captain, what's our situation? Will we reach the Sh'Raan before they can do any more damage? In that case, I need to speak with you. I have to consider the possibility thatthis mission will fail. I've been under orders to tell you only what you need to know,but that wasn't the only reason I kept things from you. I didn't trustyou. As your Mister Tucker pointed out, I have been around a long time. I remember when news of your people first reached Vulcan. I wasfascinated by humanity but worried as well. You had just emerged from a global war. The idea that you deemedyourselves ready to join the interstellar community seemed premature. The Mazarites pursuing us are criminals. They are members of anorganisation that's infiltrated all levels of government, makingthemselves wealthy and powerful at the expense of many innocentvictims. Their methods include eliminating anyone who stands in theirway. Many Mazarites want their government purged of this corruption. They asked the Vulcan consulate to help them expose these criminals. I have been gathering evidence against them. In three months, Iwill be called to testify. It was decided that until then I would besafer on Vulcan. The investigation was considered too sensitive. It was hoped that if my reputation were sullied they would notconsider me a credible witness, and they might not come after me. The corruption ran deeper than I thought. I can no longer put you and your crew in danger, Captain. Pleasedrop out of warp. I plan to surrender myself to them. It's the most logical course of action. There's a diplomatic frequency we sometimes use. It's in a lowersubspace band. I doubt the Mazarites are aware of it. It's been a few years since I did this. You've done your best, Captain, and I thank you for it, but it'stime for me to turn myself over to them. Captain. Sickbay? I am sorry to disappoint you. I look forward to adding thisincident to my testimony at your trial. Captain's starlog, February 9, 2152. The Vulcanshave allowed the Mazarites to leave. Ambassador V'Lar says there's agood reason for doing so, though she's certainly not sharing it withme. Someday I'd like to walk into a room without it seeming like astate visit. I'll be along in a moment. Thankyou, Captain. I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you and your crew. I sense a great bond between you. A bond of trust and respect,but also a bond of friendship. I think it bodes well for the futurerelations of our two peoples. Live long, and prosper. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Your warp injectors were full of it. Unless you enjoy being adrift in the middle of nowhere. He wanted me to thank you. It isn't every day he gets to tinkerwith alien engines. We also found a microfracture on your starboardhull. They're sealing it now. We were glad to help. If we can. That's very generous, but I promised my crew a trip to Risa. If I put them off much longer, I'm going to have a mutiny on myhands. Geskana? Send me the coordinates. I'll break the news to my crew. It's not like you to pass up an away mission. Trip. What about the two weeks we spent in Australia? We had a greattime. It's not going to be like that. I get the feeling Zobral's aman who likes to indulge his guests. He's promised to roll out the redcarpet for us. It'll be more fun than purging impulse manifolds. Well,suit yourself. I'll see if Malcolm's interested. But I was hoping you'denjoy spending some time with your captain. It's a dry heat. Good to be here. You remember Commander Tucker. Quite a few, but none as big as this one. Please. It's very good. When Trip and I did our survival training, inthe desert, we never ate this well. Doesn't seem to be bothering you now. It's challenging at times, but that's why we're out here. Only once. We were attacked by a hostile species with a lotmore firepower than Enterprise. I set a course back to Earth to upgradeour weapons, but we ended up having to do the repairs ourselves. It's had its share of surprises. Beautiful tapestries. That one's interesting. No, no, no. I couldn't. You're far too generous. Besides, I wouldn't have any place tohang it. Thank you. I can't promise we'll win any trophies. Thanks. You all right? Next time I'll set you up with a no-look pass. Archer. Can it wait? We're a little busy at the moment. Hold on a minute. It's my Science Officer. She saysit's important. Do you mind? What's the problem? What kind of danger? Maybe I'm wrong, but they don't seem like terrorists to me. We're on our way. The problem with being a starship captain is you're neverreally off duty. I'm afraid we have to cut our visit short. Problem with the starboard engine. T'Pol says she needs us upthere right away. Remember those impulse manifolds you said needed purging? Youwere right. I wish we did. We'll come back if there's time, I promise. I take it those days are over. You said you brought me down here for a reason. I have afeeling it wasn't to hear a history lesson. I really don't see what I can do for you. I don't know what you'veheard about me, but I think you've been misled. What about them? Archer. We've taken shelter. Should be Archer to Enterprise. Enterprise. Respond. Rough game. Better have Doctor Phlox take a look at it when we get back. I was thinking about those Suliban prisoners. If we hadn'thelped them escape, we wouldn't be in this situation. What is it? There's just one problem. Zobral. I get the feeling he's notgoing to take no for an answer. Come on. I thought you hated the desert. You're going to have to yell a little louder than that. It was east of the camp. We're heading east. About thirty kilometres. It looked abandoned. That's because you forgot your survival training. Take a goodlook on your way in at your surroundings. That could be foranother eight or nine hours. We need to find shelter. Trip. What? I think the heat's getting to you. No. Something a lot bigger. You all right? Come on. Come on. We got to keep moving. Come on. We're almost there. Nice little place I know. Plenty of shade. Heat exhaustion. Here. Come here. Here. Thereyou go. Easy, easy. Here take mine. Go ahead. You drink it. That's an order. Take the water, or I'll knock you on your ass and pour it downyour throat.Â Easy. Easy. Water's off the menu. I found a new use for the stun setting. It may not taste toogood, but I think I boiled away anything that can hurt us. Let's not get into that argument again. You need water. You've got a fever, Trip. Your heart's racing, you've got allthe symptoms of heatstroke. If you fall asleep, you could lapse into acoma. When we get back to Enterprise you can sleep all you want, butright now, you got to stay with me and drink this water. If I had aneedle I'd give it you intravenously, but I don't. Come on, sit up. Here you go. Good. Commander. The warp reactor. Break it down for me. What are the eight major components? Name them. That's an order. Not at the moment, but when we get back to Enterprise I'll haveChef make you a dinner you'll never forget. What would you like? Anything. No, Chef doesn't do snake very well. Tell me what you want. Okay, what else? No problem. What kind of vegetables? Hey, vegetables? Dessert? Geography. Do you know how to play? You know, you say Amazon River, which ends in an R and then Isay Rhode Island. No. No, it's a game. You're supposed to tell me some place thatstarts with a D. X? X. No, no, don't tell me. I know an X. Xanadu. It doesn't matter. You just used an alien planet, Draylax. Easy, easy, easy, Easy, easy. Get your head down! Get down! We got to get out of here. Come on. Come on. Come on. I don't remember taking orders from you. I doubt I'll ever convince him to set foot on another desert,but he'll be fine. Zobral, even if I were the warrior you thought Iwas, that's not why we're out here. I know. The irony is, I have the feeling his cause is worthfighting for. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

The dispersion field covers half thecontinent, but if I disable these three satellites, I think I can get aclear reading of the eastern desert. There's a vessel approaching from thesurface. It's Zobral. There were eighty nine. There were only eighty nine Suliban, notthousands. I would hardly call it an army. It was more like a few dozenprison guards, and to be honest they didn't put up much of a fight. Actually, I'm the tactical officer on this ship, and I don't haveany experience at waging desert warfare. I'm afraid you've come to thewrong people for help.

This is Enterprise. Our Captain and Chief Engineer were invited. A man named Zobral. And you are? His ship was damaged and we assisted him. In return, he offeredhis hospitality. I need to speak to you, Captain. It's urgent. Are you alone? I've been contacted by a government official in a city about twohundred kilometres from where you are now. He claims that you're indanger. According to him Zobral and his men are terrorists. They've been responsible for numerousattacks on civilian targets within the city. Perhaps not, but until we're certain whothey are, I suggest you return to the ship. Hail the Captain. Captain, are you all right? In the middle of an assault? See if you can findChancellor Trellit. You neglected to mention that you'd beattacking the encampment. Captain Archer wanted to speak with Zobral. I don't know. If you'd be willing to end your assault, we couldlaunch a search party. If you believe we're assisting the terrorists, you're mistaken. Let us find them and we'll leave immediately. Chancellor. That might provoke the Torothans. I suggest you try to find aless intrusive way to penetrate their defenses. Humanity's first warp drive was developed there. It seemed alogical place to begin. What's your point? Contacting new worlds always involves unexpected risks. The HighCommand has very specific protocols regarding planetary conflicts. Eventually, Captain Archer will have to create some directives of hisown. Is the Captain with you? Commander Tucker? Where are they? Bring him in. Jonathan Archer is an excellent starship captain, but he'shardly the invincible warrior described to you. What about our people? Our sensors are being disrupted and the Torothans havethreatened to fire on us if we launch a shuttlepod. With you at the helm our chances would improve. You're mistaken. The Torothans believe we've joined your cause. If Captain Archer and Commander Tucker are apprehended, they'llundoubtedly be treated as members of your clan. They'll become victimsof the same oppression you've been fighting all these years. You shouldfeel as responsible for those two men as you do for your own. Our sensors would have detected them. Would they be targeting one of your settlements? Set a course and prepare to fire. I believe they've located theCaptain and Commander Tucker. Fire. I see them. Two humans bearing one one five mark three. What you told him was correct. Decisions toget involved in the conflicts of other worlds should be left togovernments, and not starship captains."
1606,ENT,episode 22,TUCKER,"If it's all the same to you, Captain I'llsit this one out. Well, I'm up to my ears in work. The impulse manifolds need tobe purged, the gravity plating on C deck still isn't aligned. Desert, sir? The heat, the dry air. You know how it sucks thelife out of me. Survival training in the outback? Drinking recycled sweat andeating snake meat? That's your idea of a great time? Promise I won't have to eat any snake meat? It's hotter than hell out there. Forty one degrees. It was just a couple of clogged injectors. From orbit, you'd think the entire planet's nothing but sand. Two thirds water. What's that called again? I must have lost about three kilos during that last week. Theheat always takes away my appetite. I guess I'm getting acclimated. They haven't bothered us since. Looks delicious. What is it? What are these little chunks? Now? I just ate half a teracaq. I'll give it a shot, Captain. Never better. Two centimetres to the right and you'd have had it. All right. hat's going on? Can't we at least finish this quarter? Well, thanks for one hell of a game. What the hell was that? Who told you that? If it's all the same to you, we'd rather get back to Enterprise. That damn midfielder knocked me down three times during thelast quarter. I must've bruised half a dozen ribs. So, does the great warrior have any ideas about how we'regetting out of here? You're not thinking about helping these people? T'Pol's ears must be burning. Want your Chief Engineer'sadvice? Walk away. They lured us down here under false pretenses, andnow they're asking us to help them fight a war? That's a lot differentthan breaking a few innocent people out of prison. I don't know about you, but I'd rather take my chances out inthat desert. Not tonight. Two men out in the open. You'd think they would have spotted usby now. We're down here! You sure we're going in the right direction? How far? Thirty? What if we find more of Zobral's men inside? All I saw was sand. I don't remember any buildings. Didn't they also say something about only walking at night? Can't we wait until it cools down a little? Twenty minutes, Captain. Ten? To cherry-flavoured snow cones. WhatI wouldn't give for one right about now. Youhear that? It sounds like a ship. No, listen. Over there. A shuttlepod? Yeah. My shift doesn't begin for another six hours. Where? Where are we going? Are there blankets down there? I'm freezing. No, sir. I won't take another man's water. Got to keep moving. Thanks. Home, sweet home. I hope you're not planning to hog that all foryourself. Now, this is my idea of a great time. What'd you do, rub two sticks together? No thanks. I'm not thirsty. Worse than blood soup. What I need is sleep. A coma? That sounds nice. Aye, Captain. What?

Why didn't they? Interesting. Where are they now? You expect us to stand by while you send morepeople to join Zobral? Of course, I forgot. They just went down forthe hospitality. That's what you promised before. We'll locateyour men ourselves and deal with them accordingly. That's assuming theyhaven't already been killed.

Oh, your crew is very thorough. Do you answer every distress call you pick up? The galaxy could use more people like you. Tomorrow you'll join me in my home. BringCommander Tucker. I'll prepare a meal in your honour. It's the least Ican do to show my gratitude. That can wait one more day, can't it? There's going to be a Geskana match. I doubt you've ever seenanything like it. Yes. You might want to participate, assuming you enjoycompetition. I should warn you, Captain, I am easily offended. Dress for warm weather. Welcome. Yes, of course, of course. This is the man who repaired myship. A brilliant engineer. Oh, you are far too modest. Well, I hope you're hungry. I'veprepared quite a feast. Are there many deserts on your world? Oh well, we have a handful of lakes and small seas. What aboutEarth? Extraordinary. More wine? Yalasat. It's made from a cactus that grows in the northernfoothills. How was your roast teracaq? It must be difficult adjusting to new cultures. Did you ever think of turning back? Sounds like you've had an eventful journey. Well, perhaps your visit here will be one of them. Oh, you're going to enjoy this. Blood soup. I don't usually eat this well but I promised yourCaptain an exceptional meal. The essence of the male, chopped, and seasoned. Thank you. Which do you prefer? It's yours. Please. Consider it a gift. Something smaller then. I know you willappreciate this. A Suliban made it. A Suliban I met several years ago. Interesting people, don't you agree? The Geskana match is about to begin. I'm hopingyou will honour us by participating. You will be glad you did. Geskana requires a great deal ofstrength. Think you're ready? This is an ideal game for men like you. So close. Take your time. Catchyour breath. I hope everything is all right. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You must have other people that can correct this problem. As I said, Captain, I am easily offended. You should not believe the Torothans. Ihave just been informed that we picked up a lengthy transmissionbetween your vessel and Chancellor Trellit. Whatever he told yourScience Officer it is not true. I wanted this to wait till later, but Ibeg you, let me explain the real reason why I asked you here. You havea reputation for being fair, a man of great integrity. When you hearwhat I have to say, I am certain you will want to help us. It is called a yrott. The word means to stand apart. When we lived in the cities we wereforced to wear these whenever we walked in public. When the caste system was finally abolished, we were led tobelieve that everyone would be treated equally. I remember thecelebrations. Yrotts being burned in the streets. People saying that wehad finally been granted our rights. The Torothan Clan signed theaccord, but they never abided by it. They still control the government,the lands, the resources, everything. We spent ten years stagingprotests, appealing to the courts, until finally we realised there wasonly one way to get their attention. We have hundreds of camps justlike this one all across the desert, and we are going to keep attackingthe Torothans until our voices are heard. They call us terrorists, butthe truth is they have been terrorising us for centuries. The Torothans have ten times as many soldiers as we do. Wewon't last much longer without your help. They said you would be humble. I scanned your vessel. You havean arsenal of powerful weapons, but more importantly, I need yourwisdom. Our current strategy isn't working, but I am confident thattogether we can find one that does. I would be honoured to fightalongside you, as would all of my men. Torothan cruisers. Usually they begin their bombardment afterdark. They're getting started early today. What about the Suliban? You liberated a detention camp, freed thousands of prisoners. A Suliban transport captain. He told me of an explorer who wasalso a great warrior. A man who helped them defeat an entire army. Captain Jonathan Archer. Prepare my ship. This won't last more than a few hours. We'llcontinue this discussion later. You'll be safe here. If it's all the same to you, we'd rather get back to Enterprise. Oh, your shuttle's thrusters would draw their attention. You'dbecome an easy target. Please. I wouldn't be a very good host if Iallowed you to get killed. Open your launch doors, quickly. No, no. I'll explain once I'm aboard. If I'm not in your docking bay in the next thirty seconds,I'll be detected. They'll destroy my ship. How many? And the army you defeated? What about his legendary desert tactics? All this for nothing. You have far better sensors than we do. I'm sure you'll findthem. There was a narrow gap in their orbital detection grid. Itoccurs once every forty six minutes, but it is only open for less thanone minute. Ha! You'll need more than that. The manoeuvres are extremelydifficult. It took us years to learn them. You will be shot down before you reach the atmosphere. I don't have time. My men are waiting for me. They are not my responsibility! Take another pass over the eastern basin. No, there's magnetic deposits below that basin. They could bemasking their biosigns. We would also risk being detected. A Torothan mortar. We don't have any near there. My launch window opens in nine minutes. Ishould be going. I hope Commander Tucker is going to be all right. Captain. Sub-Commander."

I shouldn't be going down to somepleasure planet while half the crew has to stay onboard. All the same the crew should come first. Wouldn't miss it. I'm on vacation. Thanks. Everyone have big plans? Travis? Just watch yourself. Malcolm. You watch yourselves, too. I've never been much for vacations, but I've got a little villaoverlooking the ocean, and Porthos and I are going to relax. What do you think, Porthos? Not bad. How'd you get up here? Stop it, you two. Porthos. Come in! Please. Porthos. No harm done. She probably just came over to make a friend. I'mJonathan. So, is this your first time to Risa? First time. My science officer felt I needed to relax so Idecided to do some reading, let Porthos run on the beach. She'd be the first to agree with you. I was about to go out fordinner. Can you recommend a restaurant? Sounds great. If you don't have other plans, maybe we could wade out to thatlittle boat together. No. Just a thought. I look forward to it. Just looking at the stars. Never. Come on up. I wanted to thank you. The little boat with the seafood? Best I've ever had. No problem. I had a nice chat with a couple from Vega Reticuli. It turns out it's their three hundredth wedding anniversary. You can't imagine. There it is. See the bright blue star at the top? No, look just below. The yellow one. Do you see it? It's about ninety light years from here. Actually, this is the farthest any of my people have ever gone. Archer Elementary. It has a nice ring to it. Can you show mewhere you're from? Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad. Well, I can see how that could happen. I mean, it's at least ahundred metres from here. You've just got to notice the subtle differences. Now you're catching on. Give me a couple hours I could have younavigating a starship. Good morning. Come in. Sounds great. I just ordered breakfast. Would you like to joinme? Juice? It's a gift from my science officer. Her people think humansare too controlled by their emotions. Seems like you know a lot about me. Where I'm from, what booksI read. I don't even know your dog's name. Everything else. What's your planet called? What do you do? Doyou have a family?Â KEYLA How could you spoil it? I'm sorry. Suliban? Yes. This waswaiting for me when I checked in, compliments of the management. Idon't know anything about Risan vintages, but what do you say we throwcaution to the wind and give it a try? How's your ankle? You'd think that guide would have warned us. I don't know. That thing was pretty well camouflaged. To Risansea turtles. Is something wrong? Was there more than one? We've seen them a number of times, but we've been lucky. No onewas badly hurt. Is that right? Who told you that? I wish I could tell you, but I don't know. Hopefully, neither of us will ever run into them again. I realise that they murdered your family, and I'm very sorryfor that, but I'm not sure what you want me to tell you. If this wine is too sweet, I think there's another bottle here. It might be different. All right. I don't know much, but I'll tell you what I can. Icould use some fresh air. Why don't we take a walk on the beach? It's kind of chilly. You might want to go get a sweater orsomething. Archer to Enterprise. I'm transmitting a bioscan to you. Run it through the computer. I think you'll find a match. Quickly, please. Not quite. Your surgeons did a nice job. All theTandarans I met had a very distinctive feature, right here. I took a bioscan. They may be able to change your face but notyour DNA. Did Colonel Grat send you? I suppose it's possible you don't know him. He ran thedetention camp I was sent to. It was filled with innocent Suliban. Gratasked me the same questions you've been asking, except he was a littlemore aggressive. On the other hand, he didn't try to win my sympathywith fictitious tragedies. If it wasn't Grat, then who was it? Who sent you here? Who wasit? I'm guessing you two had an interesting couple of days.

Why didn't you let them finish treating you on the surface? Yes, in San Francisco. The doctor is hibernating. What's his condition? I've spoken to the hospital. They've never heard of a reactionlike this, but they're not familiar with human physiology. There's no need to whisper. He's in a state of deep hibernation. Did you use the correct dosage? Wake up, Doctor. No. There's a medical emergency. You're the doctor. Ensign Mayweather. Ensign Mayweather, our helmsman. We're in your quarters. What? Doctor, I think this was a mistake.

I don't plan on spending our entire trip tied up in a basement. They said it was very rare. It had some warnings, but I didn't think it'd be a problem. You think this is my fault. Gorgeous aliens. Don't forget, they were gorgeous. Not at first! I don't remember twisting your arm. It's not like I had a choice. We needed something to cutthrough those ropes. Fascinating culture, sir.

I see your crew has chosen a wide variety oflocales and activities that should keep them very entertained, but Isee you won't be joining us, Sub-Commander. Well, I'm sorry.

Have you ever heard one you couldn't learn? Do you think you could learn my language?  You can't say it slower. It changes the meaning. Don't feel bad. My own people can barely speak it properly. It could take a while. I was about to have dinner. Will you joinme? Don't feel bad. You've only been trying for one day. It is much simpler, and you are a very good primari. What do you call this? Strawberry. And this? In my language, kee'hwi is, er. I don't know the word. May I show you? Kee'hwi. A kiss. There's a place I was planning to go today. A steampool. They say it's very relaxing.

She's been cooped up for weeks. I should haveknown she'd run off the first chance she got. Keyla. Yes. You? You should always listen to your science officer. There's this little boat that sails into the bay every eveningjust after sunset. You wade out, and they serve seafood right off thedeck. Well, I'm sorry to disturb you. Thanks again. You're not here with your science officer? In that case. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I can't tonight. Tomorrow? So do I. Goodbye, Porthos. Jonathan? You're uplate. Don't you get enough of that on your ship?

You're an explorer. I wouldn't be surprised if they're namingschools after you back on your world. Oh, I really don't have a very good sense of direction. I got lost coming back from the lobby today. And all the villas look the same. Like the numbers on the doors. Why don't you start by telling me about some of the placesyou've been. We'll get to the starship navigation later. Good morning. I thought we could take our dogs to the beach if you don't haveother plans. Certainly. Please. What are you reading? I knew there was a reason I liked you. It's Rhylo. I adopted her when she was a puppy. Anything else? I did have a family. They were killed. My parents, my brother,my husband. It was our own fault. We'd been warned about the Suliban. Weshould have gotten out while we had the chance. You know about them? I'll be adventurous if you will. It's getting better. Oh, the water was very shallow. I should have watched where Iwas stepping. It's a little sweet for my taste. Camouflaged. We could only see them when they moved. I'm not talking about turtles. You said you knew who they were. Have you seen them? Did they hurt anyone that you cared about? How do you fight something you can't even see? I was told thatthey take their orders from the future. All their genetic enhancements, they were taught to do that bysomeone from the distant future. It's no secret. They've attacked dozens of ships, settlements. But where do they come from? Where do they live? What are they planning to do next? You know that isn't true. They keep enlisting more of theirpeople into the, what do they call it? The Cabal. You must knowsomething about them, Jonathan. Most of what I have learned about them has come from rumours andhearsay, but you have seen them face to face. I want you to tell mewhat you know. Where are their Helixes? Where do they live? You're the first person I've met in over a year who's had anycontact with them. Thank you. I'll be right back. Ready? Tandarans? I don't understand. Who? You're wrong, Jonathan. You're all wrong. I think I shouldleave. I'm sorry. You've been very kind to me. I'm going to check outnow. I can't have you interfering."

1835,ENT,episode 24,ARCHER,"They don't have a problem with us dropping by? Probably. I read that this colony started off twenty years agowith just thirty miners. Now there are over three thousand. They've gotschools, landscaped communities, even some kind of museum. If my father were alive he wouldn't doubt it for a minute. We're making history with Archer here. We're on our way. It wouldn't be very polite to ignite their atmosphere. When areyou supposed to close the plasma ducts? Are you sure there's nothing left? Could one of the dampeners been malfunctioning? Have you tried hailing the colony? There has to be someone downthere. That's impossible. There were thirty six hundred colonists. Have you finished the diagnostics? Well, get them done. You've had three hours. Whatabout the Enterprise sensor logs? They must have recorded how muchtetrazine was in the atmosphere. Was the concentration greater than theParaagans specified? Was it present at higher altitudes than it wassupposed to be? What about the point of ignition? A plasma duct you're certain was closed. Then you'd better start re-examining those logs, becausesomething doesn't add up here. Get me Admiral Forrest. This is notgoing to be fun. It's a by-product of their mining operation. It settles betweenforty five and fifty kilometres in their atmosphere. Exhaust plasma isabout the only thing hot enough to ignite it. Yes, sir. We're doing everything we can to determine what wentwrong, but that's not going to change the fact that there are thirtysix hundred corpses down there. That should be my responsibility, sir. How do you tell all those families that We came here to meet these people, to learn something aboutthem, not to kill them. What is it? Thank you. T'Pol. Trip. The mission's been cancelled. From what the Admiral tells me, Ambassador Soval will use thisto convince Starfleet that we need another ten or twenty years beforewe try this again. Won't they? The Vulcan ship will meet us in three days to get you andDoctor Phlox. Please inform Mister Mayweather to head for theseco-ordinates. Dismissed. I said you're dismissed. Both of you. Come in. What was so important it couldn'twait till morning? No, I'm sorry. What have you got? It could be anything. In what? Does he think that Starfleet Command's going to take alook at this, apologise, and send us on our way? Tell him it was a nicetry. You're out of line, Sub-Commander. I wish I was simply feeling sorry for myself, but actually, I'mfeeling sorry for a whole lot of people. Every member of Starfleet, infact. Their futures depended upon my ability to succeed at thismission. What's your point? Starfleet already bought their recommendation. Hook, line andsinker. And how do you suggest I do that? You know, this has got to be the first time a Vulcan has everattempted to cheer up a human. Come on, Porthos. Time for bed. Porthos, up. What's the matter, boy? Don't tell me you're Porthos? What's going on here? Hello? Might want to sleep in. What do you say to breakfast at ninethirty, Spacedock cafeteria? See you in the morning. If you're trying to tellme the last ten months was a dream, I'm not buying it. This is Captain Jonathan Archer, Starfleet authorisation alphasix four Do you have a Denobulan doctor in the Interspecies MedicalExchange? No, that's all right. Thanks for your help. I didn't even know Phlox existed before they broughtKlaang in. And that was the day after the late night call from Trip. Daniels. Commander Tucker told me you were dead, that Silik killed you. So, you're telling me you brought me back, what, ten monthsago? How about Jonathan Archer ten months ago? Where's he? Then who just climbed into bed aboard Enterprise? That's a load of crap and you know it. Can't you ever give a straight answer? All right, try this one. Why am I here? I thought you weresupposed to protect the timeline, not screw with it. Of course, it wasn't. It was an accident. Are you telling me that Enterprise didn't cause that explosion? It's kind of hard to forget. All senior staff report to the situation room in fifteenminutes. Mister Reed, I'd like you in my quarters immediately. If I'm not mistaken, you'll find thisthing was designed to generate a plasma stream. Put a team together,Trip. I'll need two quantum beacons. They'll have to be positron-basedand have an output of two hundred gigawatts apiece. Just get started. I'll bring you the specs in a few minutes. We're going to need our comm. frequencies on the fritz for a day or so. See to it. Put the Armoury on full alert. Turn the ship around, Travis. We're going back to the Paraagan colony. What are you all waiting for? It wasn't us, Trip. We didn't do it. Take alook at the dispersal curve here and here. You'll have to isolate thesub-assembly tolerances from the emitter algorithms. Exactly. Not if you generate a stable flux between the positronconductors. Then all you'll have to do is renormalise the tertiary wavefunctions. Remember Crewman Daniels? Well, for a cloud of vapour, he's one wealth of information. Ijust spent two hours with him. Not exactly. Listen, I'll explain later. Right now we've got toget back to building these beacons. The circuitry in there isn't compatible with our technology. We'll have to create an interface. We're going to be retrieving some Suliban data discs. I have nodoubt you'll be able to handle the content, but before you can do thatwe'll have to find a way to access the data. Everything he's told me has checked out so far. I have noreason to doubt him this. Have they tried to hail us? I don't recall him having much time to pack before he left. I gave Daniels my word, Malcolm. We download the schematics forthe Suliban Stealth Cruiser, nothing else. Just like those old Bible movies, Malcolm. It wasn't written. So far, Daniels is batting a thousand. The Stealth Cruiser, Lieutenant. Nothing else. Trip? You follow the instructions? Go ahead. Have Mister Mayweather locate a binary system two point fivelight years away and set a course. Let's get these mounted on the grappler arms. Head for the smaller star, then the innermoon of the second planet. Bridge to Armoury. Have you plotted all the target points? Stand by. I'll meet you two in the launchbay. If this goes well, I shouldn't be long. Lower the beacons. Modify the viewscreen. Bring up thesecoordinates. Full magnification. Activate the beacons. Right wherethey're supposed to be. They can see us, but they have no idea we can see through theircloak. Just keep on the same course, Travis. Malcolm? Now, Mister Reed. Archer here. That last shotshould have sealed off the two lower decks. If Daniels is right, thereshouldn't be more than twenty Suliban for us to deal with. Go. Here. Go. Archer to Reed. We need some help here. What's the problem? Ignite the thrusters. Go to full power. Archer to Mayweather. Set a course back ward the Vulcan ship. Go to warp four as soonas we're aboard. Hoshi? I can't believe how close they got. Just long enough to attach this and cloak it. Good work. Keepat it. Get me Admiral Forrest. It's all on three data discs we took from a cloaked SulibanCruiser. I've got friends in high places. Thank you for believing in us, Admiral. Archer out. It was ten months ago. He brought me backten months, but I knew everything I know now. How is that possible? Well, good for the Vulcan Science Directorate. Maybe they cantell me how I woke up yesterday knowing exactly where that Suliban shipwas, or how I suddenly had the ability to construct a quantum beacon tosee through its cloak. And while they're at it, they might as well tellme how I knew where to find those discs. Why don't you give me another explanation? Because there isn't one. I got a call from Trip, somethingabout inspection pods. It was the exact same call I got the day beforethey found Klaang. Word for word. Listen. I never thought this was possible, either, but Itravelled through time and I need you to believe me. Because it's hard enough trying to fathom all this withouthaving my Science Officer, a colleague who I trust and rely on, theperson who got me to stop feeling sorry for myself, accusing me ofbeing an hallucinating madman. Yes? What's the problem? Looks okay to me. Load torpedoes, and stand by all weapons. Deploy the beacons,Travis. Modify the Viewscreen and aim the beacons aft. Swing them down slowly. Charge the phase cannons. Put it through. Malcolm? How many could you take out? What do you want with me? How do I know you won't destroy Enterprise either way? I'm placing you in command. I advise you to maintainyour present course and speed. I don't know what's going to happen, buttry to keep an open mind. Especially when it comes to things the VulcanScience Directorate says are impossible. T'Pol's in command now, Trip. Do whatever you n to help her. That goes for all of you. Keep an eye on Porthos for me,would you? Remember, no cheese. Where am I? Where is here? You said the Suliban wouldn't follow us, that we'd make itsafely to the Vulcan ship. So you're telling me this just happened? It doesn't look likeit just happened. If bringing me here caused this, then send me back. I'll takemy chances with Silik."

1843,ENT,episode 24,REED,"This should take a bit longer than usual. The protocol said fifty kilometres, but to be on the safe sideI'm going to lock them off at about seventy five. I closed both plasma ducts. I'm certain ofit. I closed both ducts. Any kind of malfunction would have triggeredan alarm. Two alarms. There are backups to prevent these kinds ofaccidents. The ducts were closed. The flash point was directly beneath the shuttle, sir, but itseems to have originated at the starboard plasma duct. Put it up here, would you? The air near the surface is filled with traces of boro-carbons. I don't care whether that probe picked up traces of breadpudding. Both our plasma ducts were locked down, and there were noleaks in the system. Not unless they miraculously mended themselvesafterwards. Over here. It's not exactly a smoking gun, but this EM signaturedoes not belong here. On the outer hull, about twelve centimetres below the starboardplasma duct. I already checked. There isn't a carbon atom to be found. Whatever it is, its profile doesn't match anything in our database. It was just where we detected the EM signature. But Idon't understand. It was completely invisible. How on Earth did youknow that a phase-discriminator would expose it? Why did Daniels leave it in his quarters? No. Well, if it is there and it contains what he said it does, itcould be invaluable to Starfleet. Pity. Assuming he's right and we manage to find the Cruiser whatmakes you think the Suliban won't come after us? Wait a minute. Did you see that? They've got schematics on half adozen different Klingon ships. There. There it is. Reed here. Aye, sir. The closer, the better, sir. All four weapon banks, as well. Okay, here's the tricky part. Reed to Shuttlepod two. She's all yours, Captain. Good luck. Justten more metres. Go ahead. I see them. You'd better take cover. Â ARCHER Bridge to Archer. We're getting some strange readings, sir. It might not be abad idea for you to come out here. I've taken the liberty of asking CommanderTucker to join us. We're having trouble balancing the warp field. It's odd. It'll be stable one moment, and then, for no reason,it'll go slightly out of alignment. Well, they're not. We've had to realign the field a dozen timesover the last hour. They're all armed with high-yield particle weapons, sir. Before they open fire? Not enough, sir. It's targeting our warp core. They're all targeting the warpcore."

Until recently, but in the last decade the Paraagan males havemade great strides to acquire equal rights. Have you received their landing protocols? Although the matriarchal elements in the culture have diminishedit might be best if I were to ask This is no time to be placing blame. A thorough investigationshould explain what happened. How is he? I've analysed six of the pod sensor logs. I have two left. Every log on the shuttle indicates that both ducts were sealedand locked. His behaviour has been erratic. He seems toalternate between agitation, despondency and guilt. He spends most ofhis time alone. I've tried to remind him that this was an accident, buthis responses have been illogical. He seems to be ignoring hisresponsibilities as captain. Nevertheless, as his physician you should monitor him closely,to be certain he remains fit for command. Lieutenant? Where did you find it? It might simply be boro-carbons formed by the explosion. If you'd prefer, I'll come back. Lieutenant Reed and his team have discovered an unidentified EMsignature on the ventral hull of Shuttlepod One. Mister Reed felt you'd be interested. Is this what humans refer to as feeling sorry for themselves? I apologise. As soon as we learned about the consequences of the explosion, Iknew the Vulcan High Command would take advantage of the situation. You have a responsibility to dispute their recommendation. Then you have a responsibility to convince them as well. You are very adept at listing the questionable decisions you'vemade, but there have been other decisions, many of them, that no onewould question. I'm willing to try to convince my government of that. Are you willing to try to convince yours? I'll see you in the morning. And Daniels claims this is Suliban technology? Captain. The Vulcan ship we were headed for, it's no doubtdetected we've altered course. Bridge to Captain Archer. We're approaching the colony. Understood. Which one? Captain, they're all around us. It took a while before we realized that thethree discs had to work in unison. The interface seems to be holding. They got a lot closer than you think. They were docked with the shuttlepod for nearly two minutes. As I've told you, the Vulcan Science Directorate has concludedthat time travel is impossible. All valid questions, but to conclude that the only answer isthat you acquired this information from a dead crewman who transportedyou back through time is illogical. I can't. Perhaps you were dreaming. Why? I don't remember accusing you of anything. The auto-stabilisers aren't functioning properly. I'll try. Game? Where is he? Captain Archer is no longer aboardEnterprise. Perhaps you should check with the vessel you sent for him."
1847,ENT,episode 24,TUCKER,"Is it really a matriarchal society? I mean, the women make allthe decisions? Still, it would probably be best if we didn't get tooflirtatious. You think twenty years from now there'll be Earth colonies outthis far? Human kids growing up on New Sausalito? Every light year. You know, I think I've heard you say that atleast half a dozen times. That's the weird part, sir. The tetrazine levels were less thanthree parts per million. That's half what the protocol specified. When tetrazine is ignited by plasma exhaust, there's onlyone outcome you can be sure of. You got it. Cancelled? Twenty years? Starfleet won't buy that for a minute. Tell him he's crazy! Tell him that's guilt talking, notJonathan Archer! I can't believe you're letting them do this to us. You'vewaited all your life to command this ship. But, sir. I would have thought you'd be a little more upset about leavingEnterprise. I wish I had your attitude. That's just the point. There won't be any nebulas inStarfleet's future. At least not for a decade or so. You're wrong, Doc. You worked with Vulcans. You know what theythink of us. Enterprise coming back to Earth with it's tail tuckedbetween its legs. It'll be Soval's crowning achievement. They'llprobably give the son of a bitch some gaudy medal and then cart him offto wherever they send bitter old Vulcans to retire. You have to find something good in everybody, don't you. I gotto tell you, that's one of your unique qualities that drives me crazy. I'll see you later, Doc. Sorry to call so late, Captain, but all three inspectionpods are getting their weekly overhauls tonight. They tell me theywon't be ready till noon, so I figured you might want to sleep in. You must be reading my mind. I was just about to suggestthe same thing. Positron-based, sir? Sir? Whoa, hold on a minute. You're saying the assembly'sindependent of the emitters? That's impossible. With all due respect, sir this is a level of quantumengineering that's beyond anything I ever learned. How the hell do youknow this? Yeah. I saw him get vaporised by our friend, Silik. He's on Enterprise? Whatever you say. I feel like a chef who's just made a meal with ingredients he'snever tasted. To the letter. Is that all? The stun grenade's on a three-second delay. I can't release the docking clamps. What are you guys doing to my engines? The computer ran its last diagnostic on them less than tenminutes ago. They look fine. It looks like we're in a swarm of cloaked bees. Captain, this is crazy. How do you know what they're going todo? The turbolift's on E deck. It's empty. I'm not reading his biosigns. He must be on the Suliban ship."

But we need to recover the discs. I wouldn't advise using your weapons, Jonathan. Perhaps if we decloak, you'll understand why. One of my ships is approaching your starboarddocking port. I'd like you to board it immediately. You have five minutes. If you don't comply Ihave permission to destroy Enterprise. You have my word, Captain. And you also havefour and a half minutes left.

The groundwas scorched for at least a hundred kilometres in every direction. Sir, I tried to explain. There's nothing left. No buildings, notrees, no people. It's Admiral Forrest, sir. The atmospheric analysis of the probe iscoming through. Even if they have, they'd take me back. I'm a prodigy, remember? How about you? What if they made you Captain? You're going to be the mostfamous Boomer around, you know. Then it's our job to let the people back home know what reallyhappened. Anyone who tries to bad-mouth Captain Archer in front of meis going to get an earful in any language they want. Aye, sir. What for? We'll do our best, Captain. I wouldn't know, sir. Our comm. is on the fritz. Aren't we in range of their sensors, sir? They're charging weapons. The Stealth Cruiser was definitely in orbit of the Paraagancolony when the explosion took place. They were monitoring us veryclosely. There are sensors logs that tracked our course, our altitude,even our hull temperature. Look at these. Those cloaking devices sure come in handy. We're being hailed."

I've had this same conversation with half a dozen people. Italways ends up the same way. It depends on the question. It's already been screwed with, Captain. That explosion at theParaagan colony, it wasn't supposed to happen. That's not what I mean. History never recorded the disaster. Someone violated the Temporal Accord. Someone who doesn't want yourmission to succeed. Do you remember the Temporal Cold War I spoke of? Then listen to me carefully. We don't have much time. Ten minutes ago, that vista was more beautiful than anythingyou could imagine. I had breakfast in that room less than half an hour ago. ThenI was instructed to bring you here. They told me that the timelinewouldn't be safe if you boarded that Suliban ship. Someone was verymistaken. You're in the thirty first century, Captain, or what's left ofit. As far as I was told that was exactly what was supposed tooccur. No. It looks like it happened a long time ago. You don't understand. All our equipment, the time portals,have been destroyed.

Are you telling me that Enterprise didn't cause that explosion? He brought me back ten months, but I kneweverything I know now. How is that possible? The Suliban destroyed that colony. We're going back to get proof. If bringing me here caused this, then send me back. I'll takemy chances with Silik. And now, the conclusion. If this place was destroyed as long ago asit seems to have been, then what are you doing here? You and yourwatchdog buddies don't exactly fit in with all this. Try me. Listen, I realise your little utopia is gone, and Isympathise, but if you're telling me the truth, if you've brought meeight hundred years into the future, into this future, I think Ideserve some answers. What's wrong? What's gone? Why is that a problem? Who did it commemorate? Then what? But it will? Fine. Keep your missing monument to yourself. Where's this library you were talking about? Well, there are. So, I suggest we use some of them to figureout what you did to the last thousand years when you brought me herethis morning. I haven't found a single reference to thisFederation you talked about. Because that monument wasn't there? So I disappear one day and all history changes? There were a lot of people involved in the Warp Five programme. The Romulan Star Empire. What's that? I don't get it. What could I have done that could have been soimportant? This timeline, the one you say no longer exists. What can youtell me about it if my mission had continued? And? Okay, what about this Federation? Was Earth partof it? Was I part of it? You've lost me. Sounds like you've got a chicken-or-the-egg problem. You saidyour time portals are gone. All your technology. There isn't evenelectricity here. You going to find a bicycle, turn it into a timemachine? And my scanner. You can't do that with those. What are we waiting for? I can't be sure, but I think that'scopper. Any luck? I thought you built these things in high school. Why is the same day so important? What would be wrong withmaking contact a week before I left or even a month before? This is Captain Archer. Can you hear me? T'Pol, this isCaptain Archer. Can you hear me? . Idon't think it's working. You don't know where who is? Sub-Commander, this isCaptain Archer. I'm having trouble understanding you. Daniels brought me to the future. That's what the temporalreading was all about. Are you all right? Whatever you say. Just tell me, are you all right? Where are you? No, I mean Enterprise. Where's Enterprise? T'Pol, listen to me. I need your help. You're going tohave to find a way to get to Daniels' quarters. Do you understand me? There's no technology where I am. T'Pol, do you remember when I asked you to keep an openmind? There's a lot more at stake here than bringing me back, orthe mission. I need you to listen to me very carefully. I need you totrust me. I said, you're an ugly bastard. You try shape-shifting on me, or pulling one of your chameleon routinesand I promise you, Silik, I'll blow your head off. Has Enterprise leftthe nebula? Where's my ship, Silik? How many Cell ships did you send after them? Silik! You're going to call them off, and then you're going to give methose data discs back. Now get up. Shut up. Get going. Go ahead, Enterprise. Good to hear yours, too. I feel like I'vebeen away for a thousand years. Is everyone all right? I know it's not standard Starfleet procedureÂ  But I took a hostage. By the time he wakes up, we'll be long gone. Request permission to dock. It may see somewhat implausible to you, but When I was in my early twenties on a tripto East Africa I saw a gazelle giving birth. It was truly amazing. Within minutes the baby was standing up, standing up on its own. A fewmore minutes and it was walking and before I knew it, it was runningalongside its mother, moving away with the herd. Humans aren't likethat, Ambassador. We may come from the same planet as those gazellesbut we're pretty much helpless when we're born. It takes us monthsbefore we're able to crawl. Almost a full year before we can walk. Ourdeep space mission isn't much different. We're going to stumble, makemistakes, I'm sure more than a few, before we find our footing. Butwe're going to learn from those mistakes. That's what being human isall about. I'm sorry you can't see that. I can't be certain, but Crewman Fuller might have seen mecoming in here. I think you put it over the top. Forrest said none of theothers could believe it when you went to bat for us, not to mentionthat little listening-post lecture you gave to Soval. He woke me up in the middle of the night. Can you believe that? I think you put it over the top. The hell you don't. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

Try modulating thesub-carrier wave. Barely. You're going to need to boost the signal. Yeah. I thought the comm. was offline. Are you all right? And the others? Any thoughts about how we're going to get rid of theseSuliban? I wasn't planning on going anywhere. They were pretty much blocked off when the ship was completed. It would be too tight a squeeze. Well, you or I couldn't get through them. Maybe a child, or It's possible, but it would be difficult. I'm positive. Good luck. I guess I wasn't thinking. I don't know. I don't know. Please! I was told to destroy it. I don't know what it does. Captain Archer, before he left. He didn't want you to find it. He thought you would use it to contact someone. I don't know who. I swear it!"

1970,ENT,episode 25,SOVAL,"They're three days overdue. You also told me Starfleet had ordered him to deliverSub-Commander T'Pol and his medical officer to the Vulcan ship D'kyr. They're three days overdue. Captain Archer's negligence caused the death of three thousandcolonists. Your superiors instructed them to return to Earth. Theirmission is over. They haven't followed those instructions. The D'kyr said they were joined by a number of other vessels. They're no longer within sensor range. They were at too great a distance to identify. Enterprise hasignored our hails and defied Starfleet's orders. I have no choice butto send the D'kyr in pursuit. No, he doesn't, but Sub-Commander T'Pol does, and since shewould never comply with his present actions I have to conclude thatshe's being held against her will. Does he really? While your explanation ofhow you obtained these disks is somewhat implausible, it's obvious thatEnterprise was not responsible for the destruction of the colony. Please allow me to finish, Captain. In less thana single Earth year you've engaged in armed conflicts with over a dozenspecies. You've escalated the conflict between my people and theAndorians which included the destruction of one of our most sacredmonasteries. You helped eighty nine Suliban escape from detention. Youmay claim to be on a mission of exploration. I, however, consider youreckless and irresponsible. A danger to the Quadrant. Regardless of theevidence presented here, I plan to advise the Vulcan High Command notto change its recommendation to Starfleet. Enterprise should berecalled. Your analogy is very colourful, Captain,but I question whether it addresses the consequences of your actions."
1971,ENT,episode 25,T'POL," He's not on board. You must have sensorsthat can confirm that. Come see for yourself, or send your soldiers. You'll realise I'mtelling the truth. This is Sub-Commander T'Pol. All security teams remain where youare.Â TUCKER There are thirty armed vessels surrounding us. Unless I'mmistaken their weapons are still targeting our warp core. Mister Reed? So, unless you have a better suggestion? Don't you believe your scanners? Captain Archer believed Crewman Daniels was from the future, butif I recall, you killed him. Nothing else. The last time we saw Captain Archer, he was entering thatturbolift. Under the circumstances, it would be best to do what he says,Commander. I don't know. The Vulcan Science Directorate has determined that time travelis impossible. It's not an opinion. Captain Archer believes Crewman Daniels comes from the future. Captain Archer claims he saw Daniels two days ago. The Vulcan Science Directorate has determined that time travelis impossible. I don't knowwhere he is. Captain Archer's gone. A temporal reading in the turbolift. Idon't know where he is. Science Vulcan Directorate has determined that time travel isnot fair. We're all confined to our quarters. I told you, in my quarters. There's a Helix out my window. You're on the ceiling. Why aren't you on a monitor? I thought you said you were in the future. Yes. There's no time. If this is going to work, we need to begin now. Ensign Sato. Forty metres, maybe forty five. Third dimension, timeline. Timeline, first, second, First, third dimension. No! No! No! No! Stop! You certainly took your time. He had thispressed against my head. If they regain consciousness don't hesitate to use these. Ready. Report, Ensign. You may have overdone your pyrotechnic display. The scorching onthe starboard nacelle is extensive. Maintain your course and speed, Ensign. Alter course ten degrees starboard. Are long-range sensors still operational? I see them. Stand down weapons. Open a channel. Enterprise to Sulibanvessel. Lieutenant Reed suffered some minor injuries, but he'srecovering in Sickbay. Captain, I'm curious. Why didn't the other Cellships try to stop you? Permission granted. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've joined the Vulcan ship D'kyr. Itseems that Starfleet and the High Command are eager to discuss thefuture of our mission. The concept of learning from one's mistakesshouldn't be difficult for a Vulcan of your wisdom to understand,Ambassador. Our ancestors Discovered how to suppress their volatileemotions only after centuries of savage conflict. You spoke of thedestruction of the monastery. What about the Vulcan listening post thatCaptain Archer found there? I would hope that our people have learnedfrom those events that using a sacred sanctuary to spy on others was adishonourable practice, to say the least. I don't wish to contradictCaptain Archer, but learning from one's mistakes is hardly exclusive tohumans. Their mission should be allowed to continue. Come in. She tends to be discreet. What can I do for you? You spoke to the Admiral? I assume with good news. I still don't believe in time travel."
1972,ENT,episode 25,TUCKER,"I can't believe you're letting them do this to us. You'vewaited all your life to command this ship. Leave her alone! Malcolm, can you hear me? Any better? It is. I'm routing the signal through the grid. I can talkto any doorbell on B deck. Same as you, I guess. Locked in tight. I can't get in contact with T'Pol for some reason, And Hoshi and Travis are on C deck. One step at a time. The first thing I need to do is figure outhow to tap into the door comms On C-deck. I'll get back to you. Sittight. It won't work. We can only access thedecoupling pins from outside our quarters. What's your definition of too tight? Or Hoshi? What do you say, Hoshi? You willing to give it a try? It's not that far, Hoshi. You can do it. We need you to do it. Had to be sure they were preoccupied. You positive you'rewilling to do this? It could get pretty ugly. You've got thirty minutes. Let's go. I'll try to remember that next time we have to fake a reactorbreach. Hoshi, any sign of the Vulcan ship? Son of a bitch, he did it. Good to hear your voice, Captain. You guys have wanted to scrub this missionfrom day one. We proved to you that we didn't kill those thirty sixhundred people, but you don't want to hear it. You're pathetic!"
1973,ENT,episode 25,SILIK,"You've lied to me before. If you don't tell mewhere he is I'll have no alternative but to Drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded. Is he correct? Is he correct? Lower your weapon. If we find Captain Archeraboard this vessel, you'll all be punished for lying to me. Where? When I saw him last, your Captain spoke of a Temporal Cold War. What was he talking about? What else? There's a temporal signature in your turbolift. What do you knowof that? Perhaps you haven't been lying to me. You, shut downall comm. systems and computer terminals with the exception ofEngineering and the Bridge. Confine all of them to their quarters. Ifanyone resists He's never failed to respond before. Archer wasn't on Enterprise. Why isn't he responding? I needinstructions. That temporal signature, it changes everything. If Archer waspulled through time, we need new instructions. Where is he? Have the surgeons prepare, then bring me the Vulcan. Where is Archer? Who are you working with from the future? Does Captain Archer agree with that opinion? Does Archer agree with that determination? But Daniels is dead. Your captain is gone. Did Daniels take him into the past or thefuture? Did you think we wouldn't be watchingDaniels' quarters? I guess you weren't, but you should be thinking now. Thinkingabout what will happen to you if you don't answer my questions. Are youthinking about that Lieutenant Reed? Good. Now tell me what this is. What does it do? What does it do? Yes? Who told you to destroy it? And why would that be? Have the Lieutenant returned to his quarters. What is it? Shut down the warp reactor. Keep me informed. Yes? Did you correct the problem? We can't endanger the Helix. Evacuate yoursoldiers and have Enterprise towed out of the nebula. You do it. I'm busy. Is that you? Can you hear me? I've tried to reach you. I tried for twodays. I did what you told me, but Archer wasn't on Enterprise. Therewas some kind of temporal signature. I need instructions. I don't knowhow to operate this device. I need your help. I hear you, but I don't understand. Repeat what you said. Please, repeat what you said. Can you see? I've brought you Archer! He's here!

That's enough, Commander. No one's more pleased than I am thatEnterprise wasn't responsible for the tragedy, but Ambassador Soval'sargument may be valid. Starfleet Command has a difficult decision tomake here. The Command Council will review the evidenceand listen to what's been said here today. I'm sure they'll hear fromthe Vulcans as well.

2022,ENT,episode 25,DANIELS,"History never recorded the disaster. Someone violated the Temporal Accord. Someone who doesn't want yourmission to succeed. You're in the thirty first century,Captain. You don't understand. The time portals have been destroyed. Everything's been destroyed. There's no way to send you back. You're thinking of time travel like we're in some H. G. Wellsnovel. We're not. It's far more complicated. There's no way for you tounderstand. I don't have any answers. And you're right, I shouldn't behere. Which means you shouldn't be here either, but you are. We are. Webrought you here to protect the time line. We did quite a job. It's gone. The monument. It was right here on the same street as thelibrary. It was obviously never built. Not who. An organisation. The Federation. It doesn't exist for you, notyet. It should be right down there, if it was ever built, and evenit was, it will be of no help. All the data's stored electronically. Books made with paper. There aren't supposed to be books here. I doubt you will. Because you weren't there. I've looked through the twenty first and twenty secondcenturies. Everything looks right up until the Warp Five programme. After that, nothing looks right. We didn't bring a lot of people here this morning. We justbrought you. Maybe you shouldn't be reading that. It wasn't just you, it was events you helped set in motion. It would have led to others. Silik wanted you, not the data disks. The people he answeredto were more interested in capturing Jonathan Archer than in blamingEnterprise for the destruction of the colony. They obviously knew whatrole you were going to play in the months or years to come. By takingyou away from the twenty second century I caused exactly what I wastrying to prevent. The only chance I have of restoring my century is by gettingyou back to yours. Maybe we don't need a time machine. Do you have yourcommunicator? May I? The people the Suliban were working for came from aboutthree hundred years ago. They couldn't travel through time, but theydid develop a way to send back images of themselves, to communicatethrough time. No, it's a little bit more complicated, but not much. Welearned how to do it in high school, but we're going to need a fewthings that might not be too easy to find. Well done. I need you to unwrap it and pound it into smallstrips no more than a millimetre thick. I still have the spatial coordinates of Enterprise, butwithout a quantum discriminator it's going to be very tricky to contactthe ship on the same day you left. Where quantum discriminators were on every desk. I made the biggest mistake in the history of time travel thismorning. I don't intend to make it any worse."

That's no small accomplishment considering the previous recordfor a Vulcan serving on a human ship was two weeks. I've been filling out your annual crew evaluation. Just aformality. There's something in your record I've been meaning to ask youabout. While you were stationed in Sausalito you took a five-day leave. You went to an old mining town in Pennsylvania, Carbon Creek? Seems like an odd place to take a vacation. Then, if I may ask, why'd you go there? Just curious. Trip, if she doesn't want to tell us. Then you were about three thousand kilometres off. That tookplace in Montana. Why did the Vulcans keep this a secret? Don't forget how long Vulcans live. Trip, that's classified information. Please, go on. Hold on, hold on. We didn't say we weren't interested. Didn't people wonder how he got them out? How long did this Mestral stay on Earth? And that would be what, another hundred, hundred and fiftyyears? You did go to Carbon Creek. My pleasure. You've certainly kept us entertained."

The High Command has requested my evaluation ofyou. Just a formality. Yes? Vulcans don't take vacations. Is this part of my evaluation? It was a personal matter. You'd like me to tell you a story? I went to Carbon Creek because I wanted to visit the site ofFirst Contact between humans and Vulcans. Actually, it didn't. In fact, the Vulcans visited Earth long before then. My secondforemother was one of them. My mother's mother's mother. Would you like to hear the story? They'd gone to Earth to investigate the launch of its firstartificial satellite, called Sputnik. During their third week of gatheringinformation about humanity their impulse manifold began to malfunction. They had no choice but to attempt an emergency landing. The incident is well-documented at the Science Directorate andthe Space Council. Of course. Their subspace transceiver was damaged in the crash. They had noway of knowing if their distress signal had even been transmitted. They'd used up their emergency rationswithin a week. After five days without food their situation was growingdesperate. What are you implying? If you're not interested in hearing the rest They realised they couldn't rely on gambling So they took whatever employment they could find while theywaited for the rescue vessel to arrive. But as the weeks passed, it seemed less likely that theirdistress call had been received, and it became more difficult for themto avoid the humans. TV After rescuing the twelve miners, Mestral became somethingof a hero that day. I'm sure they did, but no one ever discovered the truth. Threemonths passed And just as they had resignedthemselves to the fact that, in all likelihood, they would never leaveEarth. A footnote, at best. Perhaps he wasn't. The rest of his life, presumably. Possibly longer. You asked me to tell you a story. As I said, you asked me to tell you a story. If you check my record, you'll note that I also visitedYellowstone Park and the Carlsbad Caverns. I'm a scientist. Thatincludes geology. Thank you for the meal. Good night. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

2099,ENT,episode 26,TUCKER,"Make mine a large indulgence. Here's to many more. You had a personal matter in Carbon Creek, Pennsylvania? Seems a little unfair. We tell her plenty of stories. If it's a good one. Every school kid knows that Zephram Cochrane met the Vulcans inBozeman, Montana, on April 5th, 2063. I've been there. There's astatue. Your who? On Vulcan? Hang on. T'Mir was your great-grandmother? I'd be the lastperson to question your math, but aren't you missing a few generations? Sputnik was two hundred years ago. Right. Just how old are you? It's got to be in her record. I think that wine's gone to your head. Two Vulcans stroll into a bar, hustle a few games of pool andwalk out with an armload of TV dinners. It sounds like an old episodeof The Twilight Zone. Do you realise you've just rewritten ourhistory books? Footnote? This is like finding out Neil Armstrong wasn't thefirst man to walk on the moon. An alien is left on Earth in the 1950s, lives through, what,thirty Presidents? Travels the world, and no one notices him? And whathappened when he finally kicked the bucket? Did the undertaker justshrug and ignore his ears? And it was a good one. But did it really happen? Damn, Captain, she put one over on us."

We should at least investigate the possibilities. I'm willing to take the risk. We'll need to disguise ourselves. I believe you have that garment on backwards. They don't appear to be restrained. More likely labourers. I believe it may be an entertainment. Do they have food? I won't speak. Yes. The paper appears to have value. I'm up for a game. I can defeat him. It's simple.

Maggie invited me. I didn't think it would be a problem. Because I knew you wouldn't understand. I didn't initiate it. You can't make that decision. Command of what? Our mission is over.

How far? It's unfortunate that you'll be leaving these people withoutexperiencing one thing they have to offer. There's much more to them. You just refuse to see it. I haven't. I plan to stay here. They're on the verge of countless social and technologicaladvancements. I have the unique opportunity to study an emergingspecies. There's still more to learn about these people. This has nothing to do with Maggie. She has helped meappreciate their culture, but I don't intend to remain in Carbon Creek. To one of their larger cities at first. After that, I'm notcertain. There's so much to see. In another twenty years, running more statistical scans fromhigh orbit? That's not enough."

Really? Are you just trying to clear your mind, or reach a higherspiritual plane? I spend a lot of time at the library. Different things. Mostly about places I'd like to visit, likeTibet. The Buddhist monks there meditate every day. And in India,they're got these mystics called fakirs. Supposedly they can almoststop their hearts just by using willpower. Astronomy, literature. Sometimes I'll just pick a book off theshelf and start reading. What about you, what do you like to read? Oh really? Did you know that minutes after dusk, when the sun isjust right you can see Sputnik with the naked eye. Maybe tomorrow Icould show you. Oh. It's amazing, don't you think? Well, I'll let you get back toyour meditating. It was nice talking to you. I hear you're leaving. Where to? I'm going to miss you. You're about the most interesting peopleI've met in this town. I'm not going. We couldn't come up with the rest of the money. The deadline forthe tuition's Friday, so Keep saving, I guess. Find a job. Momdoesn't want me anywhere near the mine but that's where the work isaround here. I'll reapply, but there's no guarantee. And if not, there's always the library. Still a lot of books Ihaven't read. Good luck up north. Carbon Creek's not exactly a vacationspot, but I hope you'll come visit us."
2217,ENT,episode 26,MAGGIE,"Another? All right. Thanks, Billy. What can I get you? You mean free? Are you okay? You folks married? Go on upstairs and do your homework. I'll bring you up somedinner. Nothing like an atomic test to make yourday. The bomb? It scares the hell out of me. That makes two of us. Jack. Nice try, but there's better ways to prepare for a math test. You will. He got a scholarship. It's still a scholarship and you worked hard for it. Everybody's been pitching in to help pay for his expenses. Books, roomand board. You can shoot one rack andthat's it. Hi, you're right on time. Well, there's another game next week if you'd like to go. Or wecould do something else. Take in a movie? Can I ask you a question? What are you hiding under that cap? A pointed head? You're notfrom Mars, are you? Oh, I didn't mean to make funof you. Please. You mean my husband? He left a long time ago. Jack used to get letters from himevery now and then. The last we heard, he'd moved to Phoenix. I washoping he would help with Jack's college but I guess we're on our own. I can understand why he wouldn't want to have anything to do with mebut. I'm sorry, I'm usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions. It's not always easy. Well, I'm due back at the Pine Tree. Will I see you later? Oh, I didn't mean to. Ithought, I thought. Oh, God. MESTRAL Pleasant? Well, it's been a while since I kissed a man, but still, I washoping it'd be a little bit more than pleasant. We've got company. He took those collegeboards, got the highest score of anybody in the county. it's not fair. Morning. Jack! Jack!"

If we must interact with them I willspeak. Whatis it? Prisoners? It's hard to believe these people were capable of launching anartificial satellite. Some type of combat, no doubt. A communal gathering place. It appears so. Remember. Currency. Do you have anything that doesn't require currency? We had an accident with our vehicle outside your town. We're fine. No. We're business associates. No, thank you. What are you doing? I told you not to speak to anyone. You don't even know the rules. He doesn't. It's time for us to go. We do not. No. What if you lose? I'll have to socialise with him. Why didn't you ask the merchant? You seemed willing to engageeveryone else in conversation. Why does he do that? Then perhaps you can help me construct a subspace transceiver. If we remain here, we'll die. This world's on the brink ofself-annihilation. Because your fascination with this species is blinding you. Yousit for hours each day in front of this idiotic device. Open your eyes. They revel in violence. They devote what littletechnology they have to devising ways of killing each other. What potential? Only because they believe we're human. If they discovered thetruth do you think they'd be so compassionate? Where are you going? Why? It'll be safer to go after dark. You can't risk being followed. Waveform discriminator? More research? Then why did you lie about it? You were engaging in intimate activity. You're to have no further contact with that woman. I'm still in command. I was about to meditate. Studying meditation techniques? You'd be surprised what a disciplined mind can accomplish. Whatelse do you study at this library? I have an interest in astronomy as well. I've seen it already. And you. Why do you need us here? We can't interfere. At best, these humans only live to be sixty or seventy. Is itworth the risk just to extend their lives a few more years? Compassion is an emotion. Proceed twenty two metres, then turn rightat the junction. In eight metres, you'll find a narrowopening near the ground that leads to an abandoned shaft. There's a stratum of quartz on the wall, opposite theopening. Set your dispersal radius to seven degrees. Two more metres. Approximately thirty metres. 3 T'Mir. We thought it wasn't transmitted. Understood. That's correct. Home. Up north. I'm sure you'll meet a lot of interesting people at college. What? Why not? What will you do? Can you try again next year for the scholarship? I'm sure they will offer it to you again. Perhaps. Didn't you terminate your employment? All of them or just one? Where would you go? Perhaps I can arrange for you to be on the next survey ship. He was killed in the crash. Mestral died in the crash as well. We cremated their remains."

This is the third timethis week I've had to fix Mrs. Garrett's sink. It might be tolerable if her son didn't insist on calling meMoe. There is a comic actor known as a Stooge with that name. The boybelieves we have similar hair. This is intolerable. I'm a warp field engineer. I told you, it's impossible. Why? What if they see the weapon? We can't contaminate their culture. Yes, but I promised Mrs. Garrett I'd repair this suction device. Such as alcohol, frozen fish sticks, the constant threat ofnuclear annihilation? I've seen enough. If this is your attempt at humour That's what you've done, much closer than we anticipated. Yourduty is to return to Vulcan and report your findings. The High Command will never allow it. Tell him it's notpossible. T'Mir?"

You plan to eat standing up? This isn't avisit to the principal's office, Malcolm. At ease. No. No business. I just wanted to have a long overdue meal withmy Armoury Officer. I heard that England made itto the finals in the World Cup. The World Cup? Soccer? Any sports you do follow? Thanks. Didn't your mother ever tell you not to bring your homework tothe table? This looks fine. Archer. Take us out of warp. I'm on my way. Looks like we'll have toreschedule. Anybody home? What about geographical features? Anything interesting? Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I could use somefresh air. Put us in a standard orbit. Find a volcano with a gentle slope. Preferably one that's noterupting. Prep a shuttlepod, Travis. We'll take shifts down to Report! Emergency bulkheads? Was anybody in them? Find out what happened. Malcolm! Archer to Engineering. I was hoping you could tell me. Nothing on our sensors. How are your people? Keep me posted. Archer out. Any casualty reports? Can you get a visual? There. Just behind the secondary plasma vent. You seeit? It's too small. Can you tell if it's active? I've never heard of a minefield with just two mines. Are thequantum beacons still mounted on the grappler arm? Lower them into position, then modify the viewscreen. Activatethe beacon. How bad is it? Trip, I'm not sure Malcolm's going to be able to defuse thisthing. Couldn't we just detach that section of hull plating? Let itdrift away? How long? Get a team started. I'll consider it our last resort. We see it, Malcolm. Ever see a ship like that? Why didn't the beacons let us see through its cloak? Archer to Sickbay. Is Hoshi in any shape to return to the Bridge? It's urgent. Understood. Any luck? Not a very subtle warning shot. Can you get us out of here? We'll give you whatever help we can. Bridge to Lieutenant Reed. Our friends seem to be anxious for us to leave. We're going tobreak orbit, nice and slowly. I'll try to remember. Maneuvering thrusters only. Activate the beacon. That doesn't mean they're not still close. Go ahead. How good a theory? I've got Trip working on a backup plan,but I'd prefer not to use it. Right now, you're our best bet. Becareful, Malcolm. Go ahead. What about it? Is there a problem? I'm on my way, Lieutenant. TheBridge is yours. That's why I need you here, Trip. Thought you might need a hand. Let's see what we can do with the one you got. Could have been worse. It missed the bone, and it looks likethe pressure from the spike is keeping the wound from bleeding toomuch. You'll be in Sickbay in no time. These should cut right throughit. Not without doing more damage to that leg. I intend to save both. That backup plan I was telling you about? I asked Trip toprepare to detach this section of hull plating. Seemed like a good ideaat the time. Not with you attached to it. Phlox's own recipe. I don't want you too sedated. I'm going to need your help. Someone's got to defuse this thing. You're going to talk me through it. I'm a quick study. In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant we're sitting aboutfive metres from an impulse reactor. I'm not leaving until we take thisweapon offline. The way I see it, you don't have much choice. You're sort ofstuck here. So would you let me get started? Romulans? I read about them when I waswith Daniels. Not much. Just the name. He wouldn't let me see anything else. T'Pol? That's going to be a little tough to do at the moment. Is thereany way you can explain our situation? We've taken two of the detonation circuits offline. Threemore to go. Keep me posted. There's six of them. So, where were we? This morning, at breakfast, before we were interrupted. Yousaid you didn't follow any particular sport. How about hobbies? Any hobbies? I could've sworn I've seen you reading a book or two in themess hall. It helps me focus. It calms my nerves. Sorry. It made you a little nervous this morning, too, didn'tit? Why is that? Never too late to learn. I had a CO once felt the same way. They're your crew, not yourfriends. I thought about that a lot when I took this command, but thenI realised this is not your typical mission. We could be out here foryears. All we have to depend on is each other. I appreciate your suggestions, Malcolm. Anything else? What's the point of having a senior staff if they just sitaround with their mouths shut? I'm glad they have opinions. I rely onthem. Keep going. I'm aware of your concerns in that area. Ah ha. You're talking in the past tense, Lieutenant. Thanks. Go ahead. Maintain course and speed. How do we do that? You must have realised this wasn't going to be your typicalarmory posting. That my command style lacked a certain spit and polish. Strange. I understand you came from a long line of Royal Navy men. Yourfather, your grandfather. Why pick Starfleet? Why not continue thefamily tradition? What happened? So, what happened? Grow out of what? You're afraid of the water? So instead of a life on the sea you chose a life in the vacuumof space? The one with aquaphobia? Talk about facing your deepest fears. I don't think I do. You were telling me about the Clement. I appreciate what you're trying to tell me, Malcolm, but I washoping you'd be able to save your heroics for another time. Got you. I said I heard you, Lieutenant. What? What is it? I won't tell a soul. T'Pol, report. I'm defusing the last detonation circuit. Stand by. Lieutenant? How can we get to it? Show me that sub-detonator. I thought you were afraid of the water. Your scanner,Lieutenant. We'll dismantle this thing piece by piece if we have to. My schedule's open. I'm not about to leave one of my crew behind. We're wasting time. Help me figure out a way to get you off ofhere. That's an order. What the hellare you doing? Great. If I were the kind of captain you think I shouldbe, I'd bust your ass back to crewman. I'm not going to do that, Malcolm. When we triggered that sub-detonator, why didn't the mine explode right away? How many seconds went by before I rearmed it? How many seconds? It felt more like twenty. If it had exploded, how big would the yield have been? How close is your team to finishing? We're going to detach the plating. I'm going with him. Can a shuttle pod hatch withstand aquarter-kiloton blast? Twenty metres, maybe twenty five. I need two shuttlepod hatches. Have them brought up here on thedouble. On the double. Go ahead. See you soon. That's it, let's go. Now, Malcolm! Are you all right? So, how long was it? Ten? It was more like twenty. I'm not going to argue with you, Malcolm. It was twenty. That'san order. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

2233,ENT,episode 27,REED,"Captain. Well enough. That'll be fine, sir. Thank you, sir. I just wasn't sure whether you called me here todiscuss something. I beg your pardon? Oh. I'm afraid I don't much follow football, sir. No, not particularly. I've been working on the duty roster, sir. We only have twocrewmen assigned to the Armoury fullÂ time. If we added a third, EnsignTanner would be free to begin those upgrades to those torpedo launchersI told you about. Sir? Whenever it's convenient. After you, sir. It was a thermo-kinetic explosion on the outer hull, port forwardquarter. Breeches on C deck, D deck. They're in place, but eight subsections have decompressed. I can't tell, sir. Not yet. I'd give you an answer if I could, sir. The sensor logs aren'tshowing anything. All systems were functioning normally. Figures are coming in, sir. Seventeen so far, including Hoshi. Nofatalities. It's armed with tricobalt explosives. Ithink it's a mine. And judging by the firepower, something similardamaged our ship. No reason to believe it's not. We don't know how it's triggered. Somebody has to go out thereand defuse it, and it should be me. I have the ordnance training. Lieutenant Reed to Bridge. I've opened the outer hatch. Wish meluck. Itssurface is pockmarked. Probably micrometeorite impacts. It seems tohave been in orbit for some time. The spikes are magnetic. Two of themhave locked onto the hull. Stand by. I'm going to run an internalscan. There are proximity sensors, but they appearto be offline. How bad is it? I'm removing the panel. The arming mechanism's extending. Captain. Go ahead. Understood. If you plan to go to warp, sir,you'll let me know? Our friends just vanished. Lieutenant Reed to Bridge. I've identified four separate detonationcircuits. If I can isolate them in the proper sequence, I should beable to deactivate the mine. It'll take some doing, but to be honest,Captain, it's only a theory. The closest thing I'm familiar with that this deviceresembles is a Triton-Class spatial torpedo. I've disarmed at leasthalf a dozen of those. I believe I can do it, sir. Bridge. Another one of those spikes I told you about. It just magnetised itself to the hull. On its way it went throughmy leg, sir. Actually, I'd prefer a leg. Actually, sir, I wouldn't do that. My scans show detonationcircuits inside the spikes. I would consider letting you amputate, butif Chef got hold of it he'd be serving Roast Reed for Sunday dinner. Just give me something for the pain and I'll do my best to reach theaccess panel. What's more important, my leg or your ship? I don't see how. It's still a good idea. I hope that's an anaesthetic. Please, sir, may I have some more? With all due respect, Captain, disarming mines is extremelydelicate business. I'm trained for it. You're not. It's too dangerous. Sir. I hope you've got a steady hand. The next one'sgoing to be tricky. Do you see the Y-shaped components surrounding thecircuit? Right. Those are timing relays. You'll have to rotate each onecounterclockwise seventy degrees, but it has to be done in the properorder. I'll guide you through it. Start with the relay to your upperright. Raise it one centimetre and then turn it seventy degreescounterclockwise. Good. Now pull it out slowly. Be careful not to touchthe housing. Well done. Now complete that set on the diagonal. Sir? Well, I'm afraid I haven't started following one since breakfast,sir. Now, go to the relay top centre, but watch that one. I believe itmay be damaged. It'll need some extra torque to deactivate it. No, not really, sir. Sir, do you really think that this is the appropriate time for achat? Well, it isn't calming mine. If you must know, I was honoured to be asked to sit at yourtable. I just wasn't entirely comfortable having a casual meal with mycaptain. I was trained not to fraternise with superior officers. Frankly, sir, from my point of view that kind of socialising hasno place on a starship. There are two left. Top left first. Well, since you asked. Bridge protocols have become somewhat lax. Too many people offering opinions. We're here to carry out your orders,sir. You're the Captain. And in the area of security I sometimes think you could show alittle more caution, sir. Not to say that it hasn't been a privilege to have served withyou. Sir? Now, reinsert all six relays, but in the reverse order. You'redoing fine, sir. This last detonation circuit has an added attraction. I'm seeingsomething that looks like a back-up arming mechanism. We'll have tofool the circuit into thinking it's still online. There's a hyperspanner in the equipment case. Take out its powercell and strip off the casing. It was obvious, if you don't mind me saying so. What's strange, sir? God knows I tried. I'll need a circuit probe. I was raised on the water. I knew howto handle a boat before I could ride a bicycle. Studied all the greatnaval battles. I don't know. I suppose I thought I'd just grow out ofit. Aquaphobia. More precisely, afraid of drowning. I had agreat-uncle who suffered from the same problem, but he faced his fears. Joined the Navy, had a distinguished career. All you have to do isattach it to the cylinder on your upper right. It's working. Start withthe topmost component. Use the caliper to lift it a few millimetres andthen turn it clockwise three hundred and sixty degrees, and then gentlyreinsert it. He was something of a hero to me, my great-uncle. Indeed. He signed up with the submarine service. He was a brave man. Wasn't long before he'd worked his way upthrough the ranks. Made chief engineer on the Clement. Do you knowthe story of the Clement, sir? Good. Now, the other five components. Repeat the same process oneach one, counterclockwise. They were on a routine patrol when they had an accident. Now,there's a beautiful irony for you. They hit a mine left over from someworld war. There they were, trapped underneath an ice shelf, severalcompartments flooding, including Engineering. Can you imagine? Mygreat-uncle, the man afraid of drowning? The ship was sinking, losingpower. According to his lieutenant, my great-uncle sealed himself inthe engine room and kept the reactor online long enough for his crew tomake it to the escape pods. He went down with his ship. He did what hehad to do to save his crewmates. I just want you to know, sir, that I am prepared. If we're not able to defuse this mine, the safety of the crew I'm afraid we have another problem, sir. I need to use the bathroom. In my EV suit, sir? Sir. It's rearming! Reset that last component! Quickly! When you deactivated that final circuit, it triggered a subdetonator. We can't. It's too deep inside. We'd have to dismantle the entiremine. Captain? Those heroics we spoke about. I think it may be time. You've done all you can, sir. For what it's worth, you'd make a fineArmoury Officer. I'd prefer a burial at sea, if I'm not completely vaporised. I told you, sir. There's nothing we can do. That'll take days. And these Romulans? They don't seem like the patient types. Thelonger we stay in this system, the more likely they're going to attack. As much as I appreciate all your efforts, you have to detach the hullplating. It's the only option. You're putting Enterprise at risk. Begging your pardon, sir, but if you were that kind of captain wewouldn't be having this conversation. You'd have cut me loose by now. Sir? I don't remember. Ten, maybe twelve. Ten, twenty, what's the difference? Judging by the damage the first mine caused, I'd guess about aquarter of a kiloton. What are you getting at, sir? It's rearming. All things considered. If I may say so, sir, your style ofcommand does have its advantages. I counted ten seconds. Respectfully, sir, it was ten."

There's a chain of volcanoes that spans an entire hemisphere. Bridge to Sickbay. We need medicalassistance. I'm not reading any biosigns. Captain, it's lodged near Impulse Reactor Two. An explosionanywhere near there could disable Enterprise.Â ARCHER They were designed to penetrate Suliban cloaking devices. I'lltry shifting the phase variance. I'm detecting something in the gammaspectrum, phase variant point zero zero seven five. No. It's reflecting our scans. Perhaps the mines use a more primitive cloaking system. The translator's not locking on. Not yet. And their next message? Romulan. It's pronounced Romulan. They're rumoured to be an aggressive,territorial species but the Vulcan High Command has never made directcontact with them. Ensign Sato's translation says that They're demanding that we withdrawfrom this system immediately. She believes she'll have a reply preparedwithin the hour. Bridge to Captain Archer. We're clear of the minefield. Understood. We were unable to translate your language until a short timeago. We're trying to defuse a weapon lodged on our hull. They're demanding that we jettison the section of hull platingand leave. I'm sure you did everything you could, Captain. Captain, I assume there's no point in my questioning your plan. Bridge to Captain Archer. We're ready. Hail them. Polarise the hull plating. Enterprise to Captain Archer. Captain,respond. Open the doors to Launch bay two. Bridge to Doctor Phlox. Meet us outside Launch bay two. Go to warp, Ensign."
2237,ENT,episode 27,TUCKER,"Captain, what's going on? We've got plasma fires, an overload in the grid butwhatever caused that explosion, I don't have a clue. Weapons fire? Anasteroid? A few bumps and bruises, but we're allright. I can't really tell until we can get into the decompressedsections but I imagine it's pretty ugly. I've got one piece of goodnews. I did a head count. We didn't lose anyone. We'd have to reroute some conduits. There's about three hundred boltcouplings. It could be done. Three or four hours. But I wouldn't recommend it, sir. We'd beexposing a good piece of the impulse manifold. Captain, I should be the one to go out there. I'm the engineer. Charming. Could you figure out a way to compose a message back,explaining we're going as fast as we can? What'd you find out? How's it going out there, Captain? You've earned yourself a break, Travis. Ensign Hutchison cancover the helm for a while. We've got a man trapped out there. Don't your scans show youthat? They scanned us, Captain. They know we're ready to detach it. They're down to the last few couplings. What's going on outthere? Depends how close it was. They're reinforced with duratanium alloy. They can take a hellof a beating. What have you got in mind? Sir? Hang on, fellas. Another hundred ought to doit. They're charging weapons. I'll do what I can, but keep in mind we're missing some of it. Maybe their transmitters were knocked out in the blast. Travis? The Romulans are locking weapons. They're targeting our engines."

2365,ENT,episode 28,ARCHER,"It's incredible we're still in one piece. What's your guess. In other words, we're a decade away from Jupiter Station. Whatabout the transceiver array? We've answered enough calls for help over the past year. It'stime someone returned the favour. Archer to Ensign Sato. I want you to get started on a general distress call. Assistance required. Minor repairs. Don't go into too much detail. Archer out. Did you hear that? I don't believe it. Trip told me he fixedthat squeak. Go ahead. Put them through. This is Captain Archer of the starshipEnterprise. Thank you for responding. We need help in repairing some hull damage. If you canrendezvous with us, we'd be happy to discuss Can you repeat? Sounded like he said repair station? What do you know about these Tellarites? I think it's worth a look. This is Captain Archer of the starship Enterprise. We need tomake some repairs. I was told you might be willing to help us. We'd begrateful for any assistance you could offer. Please respond. Biosigns? It doesn't seem that Enterprise could fit inside those dockingberths. What's it look like inside? They need to work a little on their hospitality. Take us in. I thought I told you to have that repainted. Everything's in English. The shipwasn't the only thing they probed. I think that's Malcolm. That's wherehis left leg was injured. Who am I speaking with? Is there someone here I can speak with? Are you saying you can repair all our systems? We can give them either three warp coils,five deuterium injectors or two hundred litres of warp plasma. Plasma? If we agree to these terms, how long will the repairs take? Look at this. Transmit it to Hoshi and have her inform the crew. Go ahead. It's all right, Travis. Stand by. Well? I doubt there's a catfish within a hundred and thirty lightyears. It would have been nice to have been asked. I can only imaginewhat else this thing knows about us. Thanks, but I'll stick with whatever Chef's serving. I'll be onthe Bridge. Come in. They even fixed the squeak in the floor. I was starting towonder if we had a gremlin under the deck plating. A mythical creature. British pilots used to blame them forproblems they couldn't explain. That won't be necessary. Is Trip happy with how the repairs aregoing? That's good to hear. Anything else? Go ahead. Guess I need to do a better job at repressing my emotions. These repairs are one hell of a bargain at only two hundred litres ofwarp plasma, don't you think? What happened to them? They could have at least left a message. Thanks for stopping by. Don't you find that a little suspicious? I know you don't put alot of faith in your feelings, but I've learned to trust mine. Something doesn't smell right. Travis, it's the Captain. Would you mind coming down toLaunch Bay one? Not anymore. I could use a hand, Ensign. Do you know how stupid that little stuntwas? You could just as easily been transported out into space. You'resenior officers. You're supposed to be setting an example for the restof the crew. I think Lieutenant Reed is old enough to make his owndecisions. You've made it clear to me that you thinkdiscipline aboard Enterprise has gotten a little too lax. I'm beginningto agree with you. You're both restricted to quarters until furthernotice. Dismissed. Hold on. Did you notice anything interesting when you were inthere? Go ahead. What happened? Why the hell would he come down here during his off hours andstart tampering with the power systems? Did you notify the crew that this section was off-limits? Well, apparently somebody didn't get the message. What time didhe go off duty? Talk to her. See if he said anything to her about this. And goover the comm. logs. I want to know if he talked to anyone else. Post a security detail outside every section that's underrepair. A member of my crew is dead. We don't knowwhat happened. My helmsman was killed in Launch Bay One. We think it happenedwhile that section was off-limits. We're aware of that. You must have some kind of record of whathappened. I need to talk to a person. Someone who can access yourdatabase and tell me what happened. Who built this station? What species? What species? Anything? What's this? That was last week. I had to postpone it. Have we been able tolocate his parents? Archer. Did you find something? What? If it's so perfect, how do you know it's not him? He came down with Rigelian fever. Couldn't they have been killed by the isolytic shock? Apparently bulkheads aren't the only thing this station canreplicate. You'd better hold off. Their son may still be alive. You andTrip managed to get pretty far inside the station. How close do youthink you got to the computer core? Think you could find a way to get past them? Bridge to Engineering. Trip, Have you prepared our payment? Don't be in such a hurry. Are they alive? It's okay, Travis. We're taking you home. Archer to the Bridge. On his way to Sickbay. What's our status? Impulse engines? Malcolm, I think it's time we deliver our payment. It needs to reach three thousand degrees, Malcolm. Be patient. Engines? Full thrusters. Can you launch a torpedo? I agree, but I don't think we have much choice. One more, Lieutenant! Get us out of here. You look pretty good for a dead guy. How're you feeling? We're still trying to figure that out for ourselves. When can I have my helmsman back? Captain's mess, Friday morning, oh eight hundred. Don't belate."

You're not putting any more of those things inside my leg. Youstill haven't found the last one. Are you sure this thing knows what it's doing? You didn't answer me the first two times. Lovely. None. Honestly, I started to feel a little sorry for the Doctor. Therewasn't anything for him to do but stand there and watch this thingwork. A starship without a Tactical Officer? I can't say I see thepoint. I suppose you're right. I don't follow. Well, that compartment's the only place it could be, but it'sbarely half the size of this one. You could always ask. Well, I guess that's that. This computer might not take kindly to people snooping around. I left it in a Romulan minefield. If the Captain learns about this we'll both be scrubbing plasmaconduits for a month. Are you sure this is the right direction? Aye, sir. It might be a good idea to check his quarters as well. Aye, sir. No. It doesn't look like Travis used the comm. system last night. Crewman Hayes says she passed him on his way to the launch bay but theydidn't speak. She said he seemed to be in quite a hurry. It's a letter to his sister. It was on the monitor when I camein. I'm afraid there isn't much here. He mentions something aboutcancelling breakfast with him. Sub-Commander T'Pol's working on it, but it could take some time. Cargo ships aren't always easy to track down. We were within twenty metres when we tripped the sensors. I believe so. It's there, about five metres ahead. Three of the station's arms have justclamped on to the hull. There's no effect. They're going offline. We're losing main power. It did some heavy damage, sir. Power levels are dropping, but theplasma hasn't ignited the O2 conduits yet. Yes, sir. I'm reading secondary explosions throughout the station. One of those arms is still locked onto the hull. At this range, sir, I wouldn't recommend it."

2376,ENT,episode 28,T'POL,"Captain, we're receiving response to the distress call. It's a Tellarite freighter. We have received a set of co-ordinates. They're not the most agreeable species, but they're usuallytrustworthy. The co-ordinates are three and a half days away at warptwo. None that I can detect. I'm detecting a liquid helium atmosphere. The temperature's twohundred and seventy degrees below zero. A bio-molecular probe. The liquid helium's being replaced by a warmer oxygen-nitrogenatmosphere. It appears an invitation's been extended. This facility may have the technology to repair Mister Reed aswell. Perhaps the station's automated. It's a fair exchange. It's our repair schedule. A matter energyconverter. I believe it's a molecular synthesiser of some kind. Similar toa protein resequencer, but far more advanced. Water, cold. I saw asimilar device on a Tarkalean vessel. It was capable of replicatingalmost any inanimate object. It's genome is stored in Enterprise's computer as is the recipe. The station evidently scanned our database. Repairs are currently underway on C deck. Work on Launch Bay oneis scheduled to begin at twenty two hundred hours. Perhaps I should scan for one. He says they're exceeding Starfleet specifications. If I may make an observation? You seemed troubled. Not every culture is based on the acquisition of wealth. Thestation's builders could simply have been interested in helping others. Perhaps they prefer anonymity. T'Pol to Captain Archer. You're needed in Launch Bay one immediately. Yes. Eighteen hundred hours. I've located Ensign Mayweather's parents. Our repairs will be complete in nineteen minutes. The station'sexpecting us to depart. I'm detecting one human biosign. Their vital organs appear to be functioning. They've sufferedsevere neurological damage. Their synaptic pathways have been reconfigured, integrated intothe computer core. Captain. Right here. Command functions are coming back online. If we don't disengage soon, we'll be incinerated. The cerebral cortex is the most sophisticated computer known toexist."
2377,ENT,episode 28,TUCKER,"If that mine had hit another metre to the left. We can'tpolarise the port bow plating until those breaches are sealed. Assuming we can find some tritanium alloy? Three or fourmonths. And with this kind of damage the best I can give you is warptwo, maybe two point one. The subspace antenna's damaged. All we've got is short-range. You serious? We might be able to board it, salvage some of the materials weneed. It's reconfiguring to fit the saucer section. I don't see that we have a lot of options. They've isolated every hull breach, every damaged system. I'llbe damned. We scratched the hull right here, a year ago. I bumped itwith the inspection pod, remember? I was getting around to it. I don't think there's anyone back there. I wouldn't recommend giving up any hardware we can't replace. I think we can spare it. I'm telling you, the boys at Jupiter Station would take threemonths. If this their idea of a recreation facility you might want toask for our plasma back. It could be a transporter. An awfully small one. If we had one of these in Engineering we could make all thespare parts we need. I wonder what else is on the menu. One pan-friedcatfish. Smells like the real thing. Not bad. Captain, you've got to try this. I know how he must have felt. I saw an entire transtatorassembly replaced in fifteen minutes. It would have taken my crew aweek. With this kind of technology Starfleet could build ships thatmaintain themselves. They wouldn't need Chief Engineers. Or TacticalOfficers. You'd think a computer that can do all this would have to bepretty big. Our computer's the most advanced in the fleet and it'sthree decks high. So where is it? I ran a scan of the station a few hours ago. These are thedocking berths. We're here. This is the diagnostic room. A machine capable of billions of calculations every nanosecondand it can fit inside the proverbial bread box. I'd love to get a lookat that. I tried. Your inquiry was not recognised. Not necessarily. This cooling duct runs all the way to thecenter of the station. I saw an access port in one of the corridors. I haven't seen any no trespassing signs. We're explorers. Where's your spirit of adventure? Almost. Got it. Evening, Sub-Commander. It was my idea, sir. Yes, sir. Depends on what you mean by interesting. It looks like he was trying to tap into the grid when thisrelay overloaded. I don't get it. Travis would have checked with me before doingany maintenance. Malcolm and I saw him on the station about a half an hourlater. He was having dinner with Hoshi. Tucker here. The canisters are almost ready, sir. Two hundred litres of warp plasma, as promised. Hold on. Hold on. There's a couple of problems we need todiscuss first. Now, I'm not real happy with the quality of some of yourwork. Are you listening to me? I've looked at the bolt couplings you used to attach the newhull plating. I'm afraid they're not up to Starfleet specs. And thesubspace amplifier you repaired? We're picking up distortion on all thehigh-band frequencies. We're not paying until we sort this out. What guarantee do I have that these duranium pins won't fly outthe instant we jump to warp? On my world, we have an expression. The customer's alwaysright. Maybe you should make that part of your programme. I want toknow how someone files a grievance around here. Sounds like you've got more importantthings to deal with. Polarise the hull plating. Stand by weapons. Try to lock out the main computer. Travis? It's been better. The station's got us by the thrusters. Offline. Impulse and thrusters. It's no good. And if I fired up the impulse engines we'dprobably tear off half the saucer section."

2385,ENT,episode 28,PHLOX,"Push, Lieutenant. Two more seconds. And rest. It's unethical to harm a patient. I can inflict as much pain asI like. A positive attitude is vital to the healing process. The moreyou complain, the longer your recovery is likely to take. Another week, possibly two. Attitude, Lieutenant. The wound might heal faster if you'd allowme to apply a few more Regulan Blood Worms. He'll come out on his own, eventually. That's the third time you've asked. It's remarkable. Your cells are regenerating at an exponentialrate. Do you see how it's using a cytokinetic enzyme to stimulate thecell division? I could certainly use a device like this. Perhaps the Captain could negotiate a trade of some sort. The tissue iscompletely healed. Even the scar is gone. Try standing up. Any pain? He's dead, Captain. The subcutaneous burns are consistent with an isolytic shock but Ican't be certain until I perform a full postmortem. I'll keep youapprised. Computer, begin recording. Subject's name,Ensign Travis Mayweather. Human male. Weight, seventy two kilograms. Age, twenty six Earth years. Far too young to be on this table. Cellular decay suggests that death occurred at approximately twentythree thirty hours. Preliminary cause of death, ventricularfibrillation induced by an isolytic shock. The vascular system appearsto have functioned as a conduit for the discharge. The musculatureshows extensive necrosis along the conductive pathway. There aresubcutaneous burns over approximately twelve percent of the body. The right phalanges and metacarpus exhibit signs ofmultiple thermal fractures. Computer, pause. Ensign? This is not anideal time. You may find this disturbing. It's different when it's someone you know personally. I don't recall that. It might comfort you to know he felt very little pain. Anisolytic shock instantly impairs the nervous. That's odd. They're dead. All of them. Excuse me, Ensign. It's Doctor Phlox, Captain. I need to see you right away. As a matter of fact, I did. This is not Ensign Mayweather. It's a nearly perfect replica. I've never seen a lifeformduplicated in such extraordinary detail, from its epidermis down to itscellular proteins. This is remarkable work. You recall what happened to Crewman Fisher last month after ourvisit to Tessik Prime? I inoculated the entire crew to prevent an outbreak. Would youmind rolling up your sleeve? The vaccine contained millions ofgenetically altered microbes. Most of them are still in yourbloodstream. They typically survive for, oh, at least several weeks. Every one of the alien microbes in thisbody is dead. These microbes thrive on isolytic energy. If anything, theywould have multiplied. I believe that someone, or something, hasabducted Ensign Mayweather and left this facsimile in his place. It's ironic, in a way. The station can duplicate a dead humanbody in all its exquisite detail, yet a living, simple, one-celledorganism is beyond its capability. The comm.'s down. I may be able to shed some light on the subject. It seems to be some kind of interface designed toconvert neural impulses into binary code. Essentially, the station wasusing your brain to enhance its processing power. According to T'Pol's scans most of them had been there foryears. The damage to their brains was irreversible. Fortunately, youwere removed before any permanent injury occurred. I'd like to observe him for another twenty four hours, if youdon't mind."

2387,ENT,episode 28,HOSHI,"Go ahead, sir. Understood, sir. I'm sorry, sir. They're barely within range. Nothing. Maybe it's abandoned. Still no response to our hails. I wanted to say goodbye. I've seen a body before. Fifteen of them on that alien ship. I was hoping it was another one of his practical jokes. Traviscalled me down to decon a few weeks ago. He said that he brought somekind of gelatinous lifeform aboard. He said it might be sentient, thatthe Captain needed me to figure out how to communicate with it. There was no lifeform. It was only strawberry gelatine. I toldhim I was going to get him back. I'm sorry. What? The station's tapped in to the ship's umbilical ports. It'soverriding our command functions. I can't. Our access codes have been scrambled. Life support's failing."

And when they finally agree to talk to us, we go down. And whatdo they do? They keep us waiting for twelve hours and then send uspacking. No explanation, no plasma injector.

Doc'll have you good as new before you know it. I might evenbreak the no-cheese rule tonight. Sorry, fella. You got to stay. You've got four more. The ship can run on four. What are the odds of us losing another one before we find areplacement? T'Pol thinks we insulted them again. I was a perfect gentleman. We're going to have to go somewhereelse to find you your injector, Trip. These people are impossible. I'll have T'Pol see if she can find out what we did, but I'mnot promising anything. I went to decon. I thought you were therewith Porthos. Is every Did you run your tests? So what are you doing? How sure? Could this be life-threatening? Didn't we send his genome to the Kreetassans along with ours? So shouldn't they have noticed there's a pathogen in theiratmosphere that his immune system can't handle? I'm told I've offended these people twice. Once for eating infront of them, the second time, I don't even know what for. But iftheir carelessness has hurt Porthos or, God forbid, ends up killinghim, they're going to find out what being offended is all about. You hear that, boy? We'reall pulling for you. Did you reach them? And? Well? What are you talking about? That's fascinating. Did you apologise for whatever we didwrong? Are we going to get our plasma injector? And that's what they're insulted about? Well, maybe if they'd bothered to read the genetic profile wesent they'd have told us to leave the dog on the ship, and then hewouldn't have had an opportunity to pee on one of their precious trees. Where the hell do you get off conveying my sincerest apologies? They're the ones who should be sorry. There are some things more important than plasma injectors. I'll tell you one thing, Sub-Commander. If anything happens toPorthos, I'll be the one watering their Alvera trees. I just thought it might cheer Porthos up if I slept heretonight. That is, if it's all right with you. Well then, maybe it'll cheer me up. How's Porthos doing? Beagles. Let me ask you a question, Doc,just out of curiosity. Are there any dogs on your homeworld? Did your medical training include any I thought you were just, you know, a people doctor. I'm impressed. So, how's he doing? Before what, Doctor? I would have brought you somecheese, but Doctor Phlox wouldn't have let me give you any. Doctor, are you all right? Just wanted to be sure you're okay. What the hell's going on? How long was I asleep? Does this go on every night? Great. Porthos? Is he comfortable? I'm glad to see someone is. I'll check back in a couple ofhours. Nice of you to ask. We'll knowin a couple of hours. Have you heard from your friends on the surface? I guess they haven't finished compiling their list ofpunishments. I'm sorry. Just practicing. They knew we were bringing him. We even sent his genetic specs. They could have asked us to leave him behind. Theydidn't. Porthos has the right to a little fresh air. What's that supposed to mean? What the hell does one have to do with the other? Isn't itlogical I could care about my ship and my dog? I really thought you were beginning tounderstand something about human feelings. What's the matter? You'd be surprised, Hoshi. It's all right, Ensign. We're on our way. Well, this isn't so bad. I was sure there'd be something inhere about standing on one foot with my eyes shut, reciting The NightBefore Christmas. I'm going back to Sickbay to see if I can get anhour's sleep before the Doctor's results come through. Let me know ifthis fits with your definition of an appropriate apology. What's happening? You said we'd know in a few hours if this would work. Is he going to die? Five cc's. What? Are you trying a different treatment? Let me guess. We'll knowin. They've got a perfectly good plasma injector sitting on a shelfsomewhere. But will they share it with us? Not until I make a fool ofmyself by going through some series of ritual apologies. The fact thatPorthos is on death's doorstep doesn't seem to bother any of them. They're the ones who should be apologising, not me. T'Pol thinks I caremore about my dog than my ship. Isn't that delightful. She's my Science Officer, my second-in-command. She should knowmore than anyone aboard how dedicated I am to this mission. To everymember of my crew. Porthos has one paw in Beagle heaven because these jerks didn'tbother to look at his genetic profile. Am I supposed to ignore that? It would be nice to have all five plasma injectors working butit's not essential. We can do fine with four, and the fifth one juststarted to act up. We might get another ten light years out of it. What? What! I heard you! I suppose you're going to tell me you have adegree in psychiatry, too. No way. Not a chance. Porthos is the only patient you'retreating right now. You got that? Let me know if there's any change. Archer to Commander Tucker. Captain Archer to Commander Tucker. Sorry to wake you, Trip, but I need to see you in Sickbay. Come on in. I'm fine. It's Porthos who's not doing so well. How long has it been since you've been intimate with a woman? Forget it. I'm sorry I woke you up, Trip. I just need some moreinformation on that faulty injector. If we take it offline, try torepair it, what kind of stress will that put on the other four? And if the stress gets too high? And? Go get some sleep. I thought you said your bat was supposed to be terrified ofthat thing. That stuff isn't poisonous, is it? What now? It's two thirty in the morning and I'm hunting an escaped bat. That's all I'm thinking about right now, Doctor. That and Porthos. By the air duct. Do you see it? With all do respect to your training, you're wrong. T'Pol and Ihave been getting along just fine, so let it alone. Listen, Doc, there's no sexual attraction. Don't let her in the corridor! What for? It's the middle of the night. Did they? Thank you, Ensign. I'll let you know in a couple of hours. Everything okay? Thanks. What's the problem? I dreamt Porthos died. Any indication on how your second treatment's doing? An old girlfriend's mother had this Beagle I was crazy about. Even after her daughter and I broke up, we stayed in touch. When thedog got pregnant, I was the first one she called. Four males in thelitter. The four musketeers. I've had Porthos since he was six weeksold. I grew up with dogs. Can't remember not having one. You have anypets when you were a kid? I thought you said something about the Denobulan Lemur beinghighly sought after. Was there something on their list about apologising on a fullstomach? Sorry. Sorry, I'm a little on edge. I haven't slept very muchbut I'm doing the breast I, the best I can. My only concern right now is Porthos. No. No, it, it's okay. When you get back to the Bridge, whydon't you send me your lips. Lisp. List. What are you doing? What's in here? You're going to perform a transplant from a lizard? What's the tank for? You're going to drown my dog? How many times have you done this before? Has anyone done this before? You know, this isn't some guinea pig you're working on here. This is Porthos, my Beagle, my pal. From what you're telling me theclosest thing your people have to pets are furry little things that gowell with onions. Just for the sake of argument let's say that some of my angertoward T'Pol had a component of sexual tension to it. I'm not saying itdoes but just for the sake of argument. What do you mean, yes? You're the psychiatrist. What am Isupposed to do about it? Am I supposed I to ignore it? Am I supposed tosay something to her? Neither? When will we know if the transplant's working? So I can't ignore it, and I can't talk about it. What do yousuggest I do? If Porthos pulls through, will he need a special diet ortreatments having a chameleon's pituitary gland? You're kidding. Does your expertise on sexual tension come from professionaltraining or firsthand experience? And they each have Sounds very complicated. So, these three wives. You told me you had five children. How many are there in thiswhole extended family? You must miss them. You've been away for over two years. I would have never guessed. You don't look that old. How about the other three? And the other two? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. Listen, Doc, however this turns out I want to apologise foraccusing you of being insensitive before. I didn't think your shift beganuntil oh nine hundred. Just a courtesy? Ensign, will you join me? Have a seat. You've read thelist? She told me. The last part, just before the end, that littleexpression that gets repeated. Do you know what I'm talking about? Their pronunciation guide doesn't make any sense. I'm going toneed some help. Come in. Sub-Commander. Did he tell you they gave ustwo spares out of the kindness of their hearts? Since I've been getting so much practice giving apologies Ithought I might give you one. Yeah, it is. I've been under a lot of stress lately, haven'tgotten much sleep. My dog Whatever friction there's been between us, I'd like to try tominimise it. I guess that's always been true. Especially when the people areof the opposite sex. I promise. I doubt I would have even gone down, there if it hadn't beenfor you, Doc. I owe you one. The transplant? Can I see him? Hey. It's been one hell of anight, hasn't it? How soon can he leave? But he's Come on, boy. Yeah. We're going home. Sickbay's all yours."

Do you recall the stand of trees outside the Hall of Diplomacy? They're Alvera trees, over three hundred years old. The Kreetassans consider the Alvera trees cultural treasures. Apparently, Porthos urinated on one of them. It is understandable. I conveyed your sincerest apologies to the Chancellery. They'rediscussing possible acts of contrition. I don't need to remind you that Commander Tucker is relying onus. Are you referring to your pride? How's your dog? Not yet. They're not interested in punishing you. They only want anappropriate apology. For what? Youshouldn't have brought your dog on a diplomatic mission, especiallyconsidering we had previously offended the Kreetassans. You're once again ignoring the consequences of your actions. You obviously place more importance on the quality of the airyour pet breathes than on the quality of the plasma that drives yourship. I'm not questioning your pluralities. I'm questioning yourpriorities. Not when it pertains to primitive quadrupeds who haven'tdeveloped the ability to speak or to use a toilet. I obviously can't keep up with you. T'Pol. I thought you might be hungry. You read the Kreetassan's document? I understand. Ensign Sato and I have broken down thereconciliation demands into specific categories, if you're interestedin reviewing them. I'm sorry to have interrupted. I took the liberty of temporarily synchronising our clocks tothe Kreetassan's capital city. Mister Tucker reports that the new plasma injector is operatingwell within Starfleet parameters. Evidently the finesse you exhibited outside the Hall ofDiplomacy was appreciated. That's not necessary. There's no need to apologise. Friction is to be expected whenever people work in closequarters for extended periods of time. Then it's good that you're my superior officer. That we're notin a position to allow ourselves to become attracted to one another,hypothetically. If we were, the friction that you speak of could bemuch more problematic.Â "
2519,ENT,episode 29,TUCKER,"We're playing with fire, Captain. It'sjust a matter of time before this injector gives up the ghost. Yeah, but it can't run on three. You know what happens at warpspeed when you've only got three plasma injectors online. I'm not comfortable with four, Captain. We need five. What thehell happened down there, anyway? How? You didn't eat cabbage before you left. Their components are metallurgically sound, dependable. Wecould look for six months and not find anything half as compatible. You're a trained diplomat. Take the high road. There's got to be someway you can kiss and make up. Something wrong, Captain? Give me a minute. Captain wants to see me. Sir? What happened, sir? You look terrible. I'm sorry to hear it, sir. Is there something I could do? Excuse me? It's a matter of time. The longer we have to rely on fourinjectors, the greater the stress. Problem is, I have no idea how longit would take to repair the one that's malfunctioning. Probably be down to three. Well, with three injectors, we'd be lucky to reach warp speed. I had a grade school teacher who was certain I stole a penciloff her desk. I think it was a pencil. She wasn't going to let me go onthe field trip to Pensacola unless I apologised. My mother told me Ishould tell her I was sorry, but I said I didn't steal the damn pencil. You know what she told me? It's okay to apologise when you shouldn'thave to, just as long as you don't mean it."

2527,ENT,episode 29,PHLOX,"The three of you are clear to go, but I'm afraid I'll needto keep Porthos for a while. He picked up a pathogen of some kind on the surface. Neither decon agent has been effective. I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know as soon as I run sometests. It's all right to pet him. You'll have to use the isolationgloves. His auto-immune system is collapsing. I've isolated thepathogen, broken down its protein sequence. I can't explain it,Captain. It shouldn't be affecting him like this, but it is. Running more tests. I'm sure I'll come up with something. It's too early to tell. I transmitted them myself before you left Enterprise. They should have, assuming they took the time to check. Porthos has no intention of giving up, and neither do I. If you were a married man I'd be wondering if your wife hadthrown you out. I don't think your dog is in any condition to know whetheryou're here or not. Be my guest. Take your pick. My sub-mammalian database contains no pertinent files on bugles,but there's sufficient information on similar chordata. Yes. The Denobulan Lemur is highly sought-after. It's not exactly adog, but you could say it's doglike. It has a tail, fur. Most have onehead. Captain, please. You needn't be concerned. I hold six degrees inInterspecies Veterinary Medicine. As a matter of fact I've also earned degrees in dentistry,hematology, botanical pharmacology. I believe I've eliminated the pathogen. The question is whetherthe treatment I've devised will stabilise his auto-immune system beforeARCHER In a few hours, I'll have a more detailed prognosis. There are many harmless strains of bacteria that can becomelethal when the immune system is compromised, but it is too early to bethinking about that. Now, we should both try to get a few hours ofrest. If there are any changes in his vital signs the alarms are quiteloud. Good night. I'm sorry, Captain. Did I wake you? Just trimming my toenails. They grow quite rapidly. Have to keep them groomed at least once aweek. Thanks for your concern. Good night. I'm sorry, Captain. Did I wake you again? Feeding time. Don't be greedy. Nearly an hour. Only when I'm here. They're very demanding when they know I'm inSickbay. I'll still need at least a couple of hours. He's fast asleep. He's gone into anaphylactic shock. His body's rejecting thetreatment I selected. Exactly. It's not working. Fill this with five cc's of tetrasol. It's the blue fluid, second on the right. Five cc's. I don't think so. You asked me if he was going to die. A couple of hours, yes. How are things progressing with theKreetassans? Why does T'Pol's opinion concern you? You didn't answer my question. I would think you'd be more interested in Commander Tucker'sopinion. You've known him for many years, if I'm not mistaken. Have you considered that your anger may encompass more than justPorthos and the Kreetassans? How long has it been since you were intimate with a woman? How long has it been. Absolutely. He's in there. Keep your head down! No matter what I do to secure her cage shealways finds a way to get out. It should have been. Pyrithian Moon Hawks eat these bats. I knowI got the silhouette right, and I mastered the call years ago. No, I'll be fine. We need to find her before we can catch her. She'll stay uphigh. Have you thought any more about why T'Pol's opinion is soimportant to you? Sexual tension, Captain. There's no doubt in my mind. That's just the filter bracket. For the past few months I'venoticed increasing friction between you and the Sub-Commander. You mustunderstand that I'm trained to observe these things. When one person believes their sexual attraction toward anotheris inappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour. Such asinordinate anger toward comparisons made between their ship and theirbeagle. She's coming back down! Watch out! Nothing new. I'll stay with him. Unless you'd like to continue our discussion regardingSub-Commander T'Pol. We are gathered here today to bid a finalfarewell to a faithful and kind colleague. A friend who would neverhesitate to offer his paw in exchange for a simple smile or a slice ofcheese. Like his namesake, this quadruped believed we should standtogether. 'All for one and one for all'. When one person believes their sexual attraction toward another isinappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour. Hoshi, you and the dog are clear to go, but I'm afraid I'llneed to keep the other two for a while. You both picked up a pathogen on the surface. We'll have totry another decon agent. Tell me, Captain, have you thought any more about whyT'Pol's opinion is so important to you? How long has it been since youwere intimate with a woman? Let's hope your dream wasn't prophetic. It doesn't appear to be doing very well. My people don't keep pets. Oh, very much so. Their kidneys are considered a great delicacy. How very kind. Two Pillarian slips within thirty seconds. Interesting. My treatment was effective, at least partially. His immunesystem is stabilising but his pituitary gland was severely damaged. It's all but disintegrated. Bring me the small grey cage on the secondshelf. The one with the blue top. A Calrissian Chameleon. Fill this for me. I'll need to alter itsDNA to avoid rejection but its pituitary gland should be compatiblewith your dog's. Unless you have a better suggestion. It's a shame, actually. Thechameleon secretes a rare toxin that's very useful in treatingrespiratory infections. She's the last one I have. I'll need to super-hydrate the canine in order to minimize theshock to his pulmonary system. Only for an hour, Captain. There should be no problemresuscitating him once the surgery's complete. Never. Not to my knowledge. Perhaps you're right, Captain. Perhaps I'm insensitive to thebond between you and your subservient quadruped. I'll leave theprocedure up to you. But whatever your decision, make it quickly. Yes? Neither. If you were ignoring it, you obviously wouldn't be seeking myopinion especially under these circumstances. As for discussing it withthe Sub-Commander that's entirely up to you, but I can't imagine anoutcome that would do anything but make matters worse. Pass me theauto-suture, please. The yellow one. One step at a time. First we need to resuscitate him. Be aware of it, Captain. Simply be aware of it. You'd besurprised what a difference that'll make. Lower the fluidic temperaturetwelve degrees. You may have trouble finding him. He'll have the ability toblend into his background when frightened. Yes, I am. I do have three wives. Two husbands, besides myself. Very. Why else be polygamous? Each have three husbands. A total of seven hundred and twentyrelationships, forty two of which have romantic possibilities. Thirty one, at last count. I'm ready for the synaptic inductor, the small blue one. Mychildren all left the nest years ago, Captain. I'll take that as a compliment. My two daughters, I'm proud tosay, followed in my footsteps. One's a surgeon, the other's abiochemist. My eldest son's an artist. A potter, actually. He lives in thesame town as his mother. Creates beautiful things. My two younger sons and I never saw eye-to-eye. I'm afraid wehaven't spoken in quite some time. Perfectly all right. You asked me if I missed them. The answeris yes, every one of them. The children, the wives, even the otherhusbands. But we Denobulans live a long time, Captain, and right nowthere is nowhere I'd rather be than serving with the InterspeciesMedical Exchange aboard this wonderful vessel of yours. As I recall, you accused my entire species of being insensitive. Then I apologise to you and all your fellow Denobulans. Well, I can't speak for the others, but, on behalf of myself, Iaccept. And to think T'Pol told me you were incapable of apologising. No apologies, Captain. I hear things went very well on the surface. You'll be pleased to know that while you were gone, things wentvery well up here, too. Not the slightest sign of rejection. By all means. Now's as good a time as any. Unconscious? Nonsense. He's just asleep. Porthos. You're welcome backanytime, Captain. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

It's their reconciliation demands. TheCaptain's not going to believe this. Captain, I didn't. Do we have a chainsaw on board? I apologise. We weren't aware that it was required. I'll explain it to the Captain immediately. I understand. I'll I'll lethim know. Hey, are you all right? What are they trying to do to you? TheKreetassans called, sir.

You might also explain to your Captain thatit's been nearly three hours since he received our transmission.

2650,ENT,episode 30,ARCHER,"My name is Captain Archer from the starship Enterprise. Wetried to hail you, but there was no response. That must make it difficult to do business. A Kreetassanmerchant told us this was a deuterium facility. Our supply will be gone in less than two weeks. I apologise, but when you didn't respond to our hails. You sureyou couldn't spare a few hundred litres? It seems that there might be an opportunity for us to help eachother. We can't spare that many. Maybe three. Actually, no. I'd enjoy seeing how your facility works. Four power cells and whatever medical supplies we can spare. Commander Tucker and his team will do the best they can. Agreed. You've been to other colonies that trade deuterium, haven'tyou? Are they all this rustic? Their equipment's falling apart. Half these structures looklike they're about to collapse. Phlox tells me they don't even havebasic medical supplies. Deuterium is a highly valuable commodity. You'dthink these people would be better off. Then why do they need us to finish fixing their pumps in twodays? What's the hurry? Archer to Enterprise. Have the Klingons detected Enterprise yet? Travis, adjust your orbit. Keep Enterprise out of sight. So this is your exclusive arrangement? Maybe there's something we can do. Mister Reed. We'll be at the landing site. Come in. So that's it? We just take our deuterium and leave? They worktheir asses off to provide for their families and then the Klingonsjust stroll in and rob them blind. Does that seem right to you? Malcolmtells me that Klingon ship isn't much more than a freighter. I'd layodds they're no match for Enterprise. We could try to contact the Klingon High Council. We savedKlaang from the Suliban, we pulled one of their battle cruisers out ofa gas giant. I say they owe us a favour. I already know where Vulcans stand on interfering with othercultures but this isn't a culture. Seventy six settlers are beingpreyed upon. If this were an Earth colony I'd be grateful if someoneshowed up to give me a hand. I just hate the idea of turning our backs. Need a hand? Okay. This one? Sometimes I have a bad habit of overstaying my welcome. Seems to me this crawler's the least of your problems. You said they've been coming here for what, five seasons? Howmuch longer do you plan on letting this go on? Another five? I had a talk with my tactical officer. We're confident you havethe ability to defend yourselves. It would be different this time. We would help you prepare. There's a saying on my world. Give a man a fish and he eats fora day. Teach him to fish, and he eats for a lifetime. You're going to lure them into a trap. That's where deception and surprise come in. Did you bring themap I asked you for? The structures in the colony, they're mostly modular, right? So you're saying you could relocate these buildings in arelatively short time. About fifty metres to the south, right here. They'll have to be capped off, and camouflaged. We've got three days. We should get to work. Thanks. How are things going with the pumps? Let me know. I got it. Ifyou need more people. I thought taking the town apart was tough. But putting it backtogether. Do you think it's a mistake? I've never liked bullies, Trip. Not on Earth and not out here. We had a little trouble moving one of thepumps, but it's in place now. We're ready. We left Earth just over a year ago to explore, to meet peoplelike you. We'd only been out of Spacedock for three days when we foundourselves in a full-fledged firefight with some pretty nasty characterscalled the Suliban. I got shot in the leg. Just before I passed out Iremembered thinking this isn't what I signed up for. I should bemapping star clusters or making first contact with friendly species. But when those Suliban started firing at my crew I knew I didn't haveany choice but to fight back. I'm not ashamed to admit I was nervous. I'm nervous now. But I know we can do this. Archer. Acknowledged. They're too far south. Everybody, this way. A few more metres. Now. They're all yours, Tessic. There must be over a thousand litres here. Our deal was for two hundred. Have a good season. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

With a few modifications these should be effective against morethan lizards. But this battle won't be won with firepower. Deception andsurprise can be just as potent as brute force. The gullies on this hillside, are they deep enough to hide in? You ready? And begin. We've got to get them to move fifty metres to our left. A little farther. This is good."

2661,ENT,episode 30,T'POL,"Are you certain? You seem to have a large inventory. Our sensorsshowed over eighty thousand litres. Several. Not usually. We're here to trade with them, not judge their livingconditions. They must realise that you trade with otherships. Tessic is explaining that their yield isn't what they'd hoped. Have you tried contacting your homeworld? The deuterium's been stowed. Two hundred litres. Should Iinstruct Ensign Mayweather to break orbit? And if they withdraw? What will keep them from coming back afterwe've gone? I doubt these marauders answer to the High Council. Captain, this may surprise you, but I agree. However, short ofkilling the Klingons any action we take will only make the situationworse. Klingons are aggressive warriors but their tactics are crude. They're slow to adapt to changing circumstances. We'll shuttle small groups to Enterprise for whatever trainingwe have time for. Preferably people who have experience with weapons. Klingons carry disrupters but they prefer to use bladed weaponsin combat. The two most common being the bat'leth, a curved, bilateralsword and the mek'leth, a two-pronged dagger. The bat'leth candecapitate its victim with one stroke while the mek'leth is typicallyused to slash the throat or disembowel. I cannot teach you to defendyourselves against these weapons. The Vulcan martial art, Suus Mahna,takes years to master. However, I can teach you a simple evasivetechnique. Ensign Mayweather. Since I don'thave a bat'leth, this will have to suffice. Tryto strike me. You won't hurt me. That was called the Navorkot. It isn't difficult to learn. Whowould like to try first? Hey! Come on. 1 Captain."
2662,ENT,episode 30,TUCKER,"Our ship took some damage a few weeks ago. We lost most of ourreserves. Not specifically, but I could grab some tools and take a look. What are you doing in my chair? You should have asked. Well, what do you think? Maybe you need longer arms. She's designed for one quarter impulse, but, I've been able tosqueeze a little more out of her. Engineer. Commander Trip Tucker. Nice to meet you. Tell you what. I'll be heading back up to the ship later. Youcan come along, if it's all right with your folks. I'll give you atour. You'll want to keep an eye onthose phase inverters. They tend to depolarise. Some kind of trouble? What's going on? Who's Korok? Can you make out what they're saying? Good ears. How long have these bullies been pushing you around? You must have weapons. some way to defend yourselves. How manyof them are there? Seven? You've got them outnumbered nine or ten to one. I'll catch up with youlater, Captain. Sorry I never got to give you that tour. Most big ships carry weapons. Yeah, like Enterprise. Maybe. It's not that simple. A very hot one. The deuterium in those wellheads, how muchpressure is it under? Three, four thousand millibars? Should create some interesting fireworks. That's what we're counting on. If we can move the structuresand the rigs, everything should look pretty much like it did yesterday. One more metre. Okay, shut her down. I think the table was a little bit to the left. It'll be tomorrow before they're all in place. We startedcapping off the heads. I rigged two ignition sequences. The perimeter and the centreare on separate circuits. This plan is a long shot, isn't it? I didn't say that. Thanks. He doesn't want you to get hurt. Malcolm's got this rule. You've got to be taller than the gunto use it. Shooting at a lizard is a whole lot different than shooting ata person, and lizards don't shoot back. When those Klingons show up Iwant you to do exactly what Lieutenant Reed says. Understood? Unless you're planning to join StarfleetI'm afraid you'll have to give up that chair. Yeah, that's one of the tough things about my job. Sayinggoodbye to people like you and your friends. Oh, almost forgot. Schematics for Enterprise. You said you like tolook at starships. This one'll knock your socks off. Who knows? Our engines need a lot of deuterium."

You've had enough time. We'll take all of it, now. They all appear to be working. You're lying! I can get deuterium anywhere. I come here because I like you,when you show me hospitality and respect. I'll give you four days. Have it all ready. HIjol! Listen. 1 The pumps. They're silent. Where's yourhospitality? This is no way to treat your friends. Show yourselves! This will cost you more than deuterium! 1 What are you doing? You'll kill us all. Those wellheads, they'reunder great pressure. If you ignite them you'll incinerate the entiretown. 1 They're hiding in the dirt likeTarg. They'll learn to show us respect. We'll kill another four. Perhaps the boy as well. This shouldn't be here. P'taQ. You'll live to regret this. We can find deuterium anywhere. Yoursisn't fit for a garbage scow."
2792,ENT,episode 30,E'LIS,"Our medical stores are running low. I wouldn't know what to feed it. Working? Thank you, but I'll just take some vascular adhesive. An auto-suture. This is a very expensive piece of equipment. I can't. It can be. Deuterium can burn almost as hot as plasma when it's ignited. No. I'd better get back. Thank you again. If they think anyone's been here before them, they get veryangry. Let's get him inside. Hold still. Usually seven. One of them was his father."
2793,ENT,episode 30,TESSIC,"I don't know. No. It's not their ship. It'ssomeone else. Our communications are down. He was correct. I'm sorry, but we can't help you. Two of our pumps are offline. You'll have to return later in the season. There's nothing we can do. You scanned our tanks? We're holding that for someone else. Come back at the end ofthe season. I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate you. Follow me. Two power cells. We need six. Do you have any idea how much labour it takes to refine a litreof deuterium? We have three months of good weather, Captain. Three months topump all the deuterium we can before the winter. We don't have time togive tours. Five power cells for two hundred litres. I can't do anybetter. All right. But only if you can repair our pumps. I expect you to leave orbit in two days. If the pumps areworking, you'll leave with the deuterium. If not, you'll leave withoutit. Are we agreed? Korok's ship is entering orbit. Secure the pumps. Get everyone inside. They believe that we have an exclusive arrangement. Please, don't get involved. We'll talk to them. We weren't expecting you so soon. We've had trouble with two ofour pumps. Your deuterium. We don't have all of it. We did our best but weneed more time. Without those pumps we couldn't operate atfull capacity. We can give you eighty thousand litres. If you'll give us onemore week, we'll have the rest. We don't have it. I told you, two pumps were down. We were just able to repair them. Wait, please. It's not your concern. It still brings in a decent price. We make enough to getthrough the winter. It's too far away. You've never seen a Klingon in battle, have you? We tried tostand up to them once, three seasons ago. Five of us died fightingthem. Then they killed three more to prove their point. Just take your two hundred litres and go. If you're here whenthey come back, they'll kill you. Control arm is jammed. I could use some help with the releasevalve. Turn it to the left. Thought you'd be off charting your next start system by now. You obviously didn't come down here in the middle of the nightto help me with this crawler. We've been through this before. It's not your concern. Give itanother turn. That's good. Leave it there. Reconnect this coolant line. Intake's above your head. We already tried. There are eight people buried not far fromhere who can attest to that. I don't want your help. I'm responsible for my people, not you. They put their trust in me. They depend on me. I'm supposed to protectthem! Look at me I can barely keep this crawler running. You say youand your tactical officer want to help us. Even if you do once you'regone, we'll be alone again waiting for them to come back. This all sounds very ambitious. What exactly are you expectingus to do? What kind of trap? You'll never get the Klingons near that deuterium field. Theyknow it isn't safe. It's right here. They're all modular. Most deuterium fields are depleted withinthree or four years at most. It forces us to be itinerant. What good would that do? The terrain there is no different thanwhere the town is now. We can do that. If you keep your head down. What are we waiting for?Â  I just hope everyone survives this. Your people, as well asmine. Korok! I wouldn'tdo that. There's two more wellheads by your feet. Leave here now orwe'll ignite them. If you're thinking about coming back, I wouldn't advise it. We'll be ready. We're not afraid of you anymore. Our deal was for power cells, medical supplies and repair work. You provided us with much more than that."
2794,ENT,episode 30,MAKLII,"Is it them? Do you have any experience repairing extraction pumps? We get those pumps operating, we can make ourquota. Pump Six. I thought we had three more days. Help me close these induction valves. Leave him alone. You'll get your deuterium. You take everything we own, and you want us to respect you. Five seasons. They take all the first yield deuterium we canextract. After they leave, we manage to pull a few thousand litres outof the deep strata, but it takes weeks and it's so full of impuritieswe can barely refine it. Barely. They do a decent job keeping the shib'a lizards from chewing onthe power couplings. You must have a well stocked armoury onboard Enterprise. Five. They may be crude, but they're not fools. It depends where you're suggesting we relocate them. Everything except the well-heads. Shib'a lizards don't move that fast. Two thousand. Besides, we seem to have a surplus at the moment. Give your crew our thanks."
2795,ENT,episode 30,Q'ELL,"I didn't touch anything. I just like to look inside the shipsthat come here. You might have said no. Well, it's a little small and your thruster controls are hard toreach. How fast can it go? You're a pilot? Q'ell. Could you teach me how to fly it? I can drive the crawler thatwe use to move our drill rigs. Really? I once saw a Kellenite ship with cannons and torpedoes. Like Enterprise. You could have fought the Klingons. Beaten them. Why didn't you try? Lieutenant Reed said I'd have to hide in the canyons when theKlingons come back. But I want to help. I can shoot a shib'a lizard from fortymetres. I don't want to hide. Yes, sir.Â  I wish you didn't have to leave. Thanks. Do you think you'll come back?"

You didn't answer my question. What kind of matter of security? They're sending you to get somebody. Somebody you'll be handingover to the Vulcans. Why you? Thanks for being so enlightening. Dismissed. Captain's Log, supplemental. As anticipated, I wascontacted by Admiral Forrest who has ordered us to accommodate theVulcans' request. Did you find the co-ordinates? Set a course. When we arrive, you'll be piloting theshuttlepod. Somewhere in the Pernaia System, no doubt. As far as the exactlocation, Admiral Forrest doesn't even know that. It seems theSub-Commander's on a highly classified mission. No, we'resupposed to wait at Pernaia Prime for T'Pol and Travis to finish theirmission. It's only for a few days. We've got plenty to keep ourselvesbusy. Is there anything specific you and Travis are going to need? Come in. If the Vulcan High Command doesn'tapprove of the water polo match I'm watching, I'd be happy to findanother. What can I do for you? Move over, Porthos. Let the lady sit down. Sounds like this isgoing to be good. Come on, sit down. How long ago are wetalking about? Go ahead. They're close allies with the Vulcans, right? You're not going to tell me you're one of those agents. I guess even Vulcans can fall prey to temptation. So tomorrow you get to pick up number six. Why couldn't someoneelse do it? Why you? How very Vulcan. So, why have you decided to tell me all this? What? You said there's a Vulcan ship coming. I'm sure they canprovide all the assistance you'll need. Why? What's his name? The man we're going to apprehend. See you in the morning. We'll be back in three to five days, Trip. If that Vulcan shipcomes snooping around, the last thing you want to tell them is that I'mwith T'Pol. Three to five days, Trip. She's got some unfinished business, Trip. I'm not sure why, but she needs me to go along. We'll be okay. You're in charge, Commander. Have you given Travisthe coordinates? Why didn't he want to come home? Smuggling what? You never found him? They? What happened? T'Pol? Where? If he sees T'Pol, he may try to get to his ship. Which way? I couldn't agree more. Do you have somewhere we can put him until we leave? Any one of these people could be working with him. Why should she believe a fugitive and not her own government? If you're innocent, I'm sure you'll be given a chance to defendyourself. We're here to take you to Vulcan. No one's going to shoot you. T'Pol! What are you doing? T'Pol? Where the hell are you going? T'Pol! But the platform's covered with acid! That wasn't too smart. You could have been hurt. What did youfind? You'll have to go through decon when we get back. Come on, Travis. Let's see if we can find something to eat. Where's Menos? Get back over there. What happened? Seven what? I don't understand. But you fired first? How? No. And you had this. This Fullara ritual performed? Why would you feel guilty if this Jossen was about to fire atyou? When did it start coming back? That doesn't make any sense. What's Menos been telling you? What's he been telling you? And you claim you're a peaceful man. T'Pol! Refasten them. Travis! Come on. Where's his ship? Your mission is toreturn him to Vulcan, not determine whether he's guilty or innocent. Where's his ship? Let's be sure. We'll allneed to go through decon now. Was that the only way in? Go back to the cockpit, Travis. Get life support fired up if you can. It's pretty cold. He should've gotten here before us. Thisship shouldn't be here. So he could've left with any one of those other ships. You seem okay with that. You're giving up a lot easier than I would've guessed. We don't know that. He got to you, didn't he? You're beginningto doubt yourself. He figured if he could get you to question what youdid seventeen years ago, you'd begin to question what you're doingright now. Did Jossen reach for his weapon or not? Is that what you remember, or what Menos wants you to remember? There's a big difference. He's playing on your guilt. Don't yousee that? Don't give me that! Your emotional immune system started tocollapse again the minute you remembered what happened that day onRisa. What is it, Travis? What's up? There's a hell of a lot of energy flowing through thosecircuits. Any idea what they are? Well, obviously something's powered up. There's one way to findout what it is. There's some kind of energy fieldrunning. Those are violent words for a peaceful man. What about her? You okay? We don't do quickly and quietly very well but we are good atarithmetic. It seems there are three of us and only one of you. I don't trust this guy, Travis. Find something to tie him upwith. What are you doing? Get up! Why did you want me here? Then trust me. You were sent to apprehend him, not to judgehim. He's not goingto get out of that too quickly. I guess he was hauling more than injector casings after all. What's your status, Trip? Thanks. We'll be going to warp three. Did I say warp three? I meant warp four,Commander. Come in. Sub-Commander. AmI about to get another call from Admiral Forrest? Sorry. Dealing with these memories it's not going to be easyfor you, is it? If you feel you need a leave of absence. You've also spent a lot of time around humans lately. When you don't have the ability to repress emotions, you learnto deal with them and move on. Was there something else? I won't forget. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

10,ENT,episode 31,REED,"I could use a few days to recalibrate the torpedo launchers. Water polo? Are you sure the Captain wouldn't have a problem with you usinghis dining room? While we're on the subject of approvals, I promised CaptainArcher that I'd recalibrate the torpedo launchers. I'll need to divertcomputer access from Main Engineering. It'll only be for a day. We're not exactly going anywhere. Is that the Chief Engineer talking, or the Acting Captain?"

13,ENT,episode 31,T'POL,"Yes? It's all right. Is something wrong? Where? Are you certain it's him? Captain. No, thank you. Admiral Forrest will be calling you this afternoon, sir. I was contacted by the Vulcan High Command last night. They'verequested my services regarding a matter of security. He should be contacting you this afternoon. The Admiral will inform you that Enterprise will be asked toalter course to the Pernaia system, where I will need a shuttlepod anda pilot for three to five days. A Vulcan ship will rendezvous with the shuttlepod when mymission is completed. Admiral Forrest will be contacting you this afternoon. Cold-weather gear, restraints and phase pistols. Your orders to bring me to Pernaia came from Starfleet, not theHigh Command. I have a personal matter I'd like to discuss. Before I joined the Science Directorate I was assigned to theMinistry of Security. I was trained in reconnaissance and retrieval. I completed my training seventeen years ago. Are you familiar with a planet called Agaron? Not always. Agaron was a very corrupt world. When their leaderswere first trying to forge an alliance with Vulcan they asked for ourassistance. That was nearly thirty years ago. Hundreds of our agentswere surgically altered and sent to infiltrate the most criminalfactions of Agaron society. Eventually, they were instrumental in theoverthrow of those factions. I'm not that old, Captain. After the alliance was formalised,the Vulcan agents were recalled. They all returned voluntarily, all butnineteen. The Ministry of Security sent a team of newly-trained operativesto retrieve them. I was only able to apprehend five of the sixfugitives assigned to me. The Ministry considers it a matter of honour. I'd like you to come with me. The man I'm being sent to apprehend is extremely dangerous. Itwould be wise for me to have assistance. I'd prefer it if you'd come with me, Captain. I need to be with someone I can trust. If you don't wish to helpme, I understand. Good night. Menos. Yes. Before he was sent to Agaron, the dorsal lobes of his ears weresurgically altered. The ridge on his forehead was added sometimeafterward. He was assigned to infiltrate a cell of smugglers. He learnedtheir craft. He became very proficient at it, amassed a large fortune. Synthetic biotoxins used to manufacture transgenic weapons. Ispent three months trying to find him. He used his wealth wisely. Whenever I'd get close, I'd find he'd left a day or two before. Only once, on Risa. They thought they were invulnerable. He. He thought he was invulnerable there, that no one wouldthink to look for him on such a peaceful place. I got very close. Twenty metres, maybe ten. I never found him again. No one did. Not until now. He's here. Within thirty metres. He saw me. I'm not certain. Follow me. We just need to get him to our ship. The Ministry of Security very clear about that. He works alone. I wouldn't. It may be a weapon. The information that I was given says that you buy high gradebiotoxins and sell them to anyone who will meet your price. You're a liar. He's not telling the truth. He says he has a ship full of injector casings. Spent injector casings. I want to speak to Menos alone. Would you allow me to do that? Who is Jossen? Who is Jossen? Tell me who he is. Where did I meet him? You're telling me lies. I followed you to Risa, no one else. I bribed the Tellaritetransport captain who brought you there. He told me exactly where tofind you. I wasn't looking for anyone else. I killed him. Stop talking. I said, stop talking! There were seven. I was sent to bring back seven fugitives, not six. Menos had a partner, or a friend. I'm not sure. His name wasJossen. I followed them both to Risa, not just Menos. The day I toldyou I saw Menos and lost him, I saw Jossen as well. They tried toescape. Jossen fell to the ground. He began to reach for his weapon. I had forgotten all of it, until today. Have you heard of the Fullara? It's an obsolete Vulcan ritual where the memory of an event isrepressed along with the emotions associated with it. Fullara. When I returned to Vulcan, I was unsettled. I resigned myposition with the Ministry and sought guidance at the Sanctuary ofP'Jem. For months, one of the Elders worked with me to control theguilt, to restrain the despair of having taken a life, but the feelingsremained. I suppose I was never certain what his intentions were. TheElder had no choice but to perform the ritual. When I left theSanctuary I didn't remember anything about Jossen or the Fullara. When the first call came in about this new mission. Maybe that'swhy I wanted you with me. What if Jossen wasn't a smuggler? What if hewas innocent? Then it wouldn't have mattered whether he intended to usethat weapon or not. Menos's ship was filled with injector casings, nothing else. Hehas a family. Our scans should be able to confirm if he's dying ofradiation poisoning. Where's Menos? He's not aboard. He's not here. Why risk using his own vessel? He'd know we'd follow him. Any one of them. When we return to Enterprise I'll inform the Vulcan ship thatMenos escaped. If the High Command wishes, they can question as many ofthe vessels that left here as they can find. He's obviously gone. I may have killed an innocent man seventeen years ago. I don't know. What's the difference? That's impossible. I went to P'Jem. They performed the ritual. Yes. Stop! Captain? Because I trust you. Biotoxins. If one of our weapons had struck this. I guess he was. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The Vulcan ship Nyran was waiting atthe prearranged coordinates. After transferring Menos to theircustody, we've returned to Enterprise. No, sir. No, it's not. That won't be necessary. I was much younger then. You do have a way of putting questionable actions behind you. If you ever need someone you can trust."
14,ENT,episode 31,TUCKER,"Is this Pernaia Prime inhabited? So, she's going to another planet in the system. Are wesupposed to play some kind of guessing game? And do what in the meantime? I could polish all the handles and rails in Engineering. I guess I could purge the impulsereactors. If you agreed to go with her you must knowsomething about what she's up to. Why's that? Why would you being with her be a problem to them? Come on, Captain. Last night, you were just as frustrated as Iwas about having to sit on your hands while she goes off and doeswhatever it is she's going off to do. This isn't just a case of curiosity. Whatif you get hurt, kidnapped? You put me in charge of this ship and youwon't tell me where you're going? How am I supposed to be a goodtemporary Captain if I don't know where my people are? Tell me that. There are a lot of definitions ofunfinished business. Could you be a little more specific? Have fun. Come in. Gentlemen, come in. Glad you could join me. Very exciting sport. You should learn more about it. Please, sit down. I had Chef prepare a special lunch. Bangersand mash for you, and, Denobulan sausage for the Doctor. Acting Captain, Captain's Mess. I don't see a problem. Thankyou, Crewman. Enjoy. Why didn't the bio-scanners detect it? What kind of side effects? I'd hate to be responsible for giving the crew the runs. Maybeyou should wait till the Captain gets back. Why don't I get back to you later, Doc? That would mean we'd have to power down the warp core. We're also not at war. I'm just not comfortable taking theengines offline right now. Let me get back to you. Tucker. Tell them the Captain's indisposed at the moment. He'll getback to them in a little while. The Captain said not to tell the Vulcans he went with T'Pol. Hewas very emphatic about that. Go ahead. I'll get back to you. You're sure? Has he ever been to Earth? I hope they haven't put Starfleet yearbook photos into thatdatabase. Let's get this over with. Captain Tavek, is there something I can do for you? Yes. Is there a problem? Healthy living. You have a message from Admiral Forrest? I'll be sure to tell him. I'm afraid it's confidential. Thank you for relaying themessage. Archer out. Everything's ready to go, Captain. Welcome back. You got it. Now that your secret mission is over youthink you can give your Chief Engineer a little hint about what youwere up to? Not even a hint? Warp four. Aye, Captain."

But they would subside in a day ortwo. Do I have your permission? I'm afraid the virus will have spread by then. I really need ananswer today. Not too much later.

149,ENT,episode 31,DOCKMASTER,"Your warrant is valid, but you won'tbe able to take him. Not for at least four hours. We've begunthermalising the landing deck. There's a half centimetre of xylathoric acid on that deck. I wouldn't recommend it. Not if you value those pretty feet of yours. Does this look like a prison to you?"
150,ENT,episode 31,MENOS,"You have no jurisdiction here. I haven't always. You're human. And you as well. They wanted to rehabilitate me,bring me home, flatten my forehead and re-point my ears. They wanted toteach me to forget the life they had taught me so carefully how tolive. They assumed I had become corrupt. and that left to my owndevices I would remain corrupt. Three years in a Vulcan clinic. Rehabilitation. Can you blame me for running? I'm not a thief. I'm nota smuggler. I never was. I worked with smugglers. I worked very closewith them for a long time. It's what I had been trained to do. Do youknow how I've survived the last twenty years? How I've fed my family? Ihaul spent warp injector casings. Not a very popular occupation, but anecessary one. A doctor on Andoria says that my hemolytic cell count isover three thousand. You don't find too many old men hauling spentinjector casings. In my left front pocket, if you don't mind. It's a hologram of my family. They won't hurt you. The injector casings are going to take me away from them soonenough. I don't want to die in a Vulcan prison. If all of the Ministry's reports about me were true I couldeasily shape-shift and slip out of these restraints, or sprout wingsand fly to my ship. Because her government sent one hundred nine agents to Agaronthirty years ago, and they want all one hundred nine accounted for,Right or wrong, dead or alive. Bur I'm guilty. I'm guilty of not returning when I was told to. I'm innocent of selling biotoxins but I'm guilty of being a fugitive. But I don't deserve to go to prison, and I don't deserve to be shot. What about her? Jossen! You didn't find what you were looking for, did you? If this is your idea of humour. Jossen was no different than me. He didn't want to berehabilitated, either. Meet him? On Risa. Jossen and I were on Risa in the TropicalZone. We were innocent of the crimes the Ministry had accused us of butwe were running, all the same. Why do you want me to tell you thingsyou already know? No. The truth. Then why are you asking me about Jossen? He never hurt anyone. He didn't deserve to be hunted down like an animal. Yes, and he didn't deserve to be killed. He was an innocent man,just like I am. You really don't remember. How is that possible? Why did youkill him? He never would have hurt you. You're a Vulcan. You're trained to repress the emotion ofkilling, not the memory of the act. Look what it's done to you, taking an innocent life. Bringing meback to Vulcan will be no different. You'll be destroying another life. How will that affect you? Will you conveniently forget what you'reabout to do to me? Ironic, isn't it? Burning to death on a frozen moon? But I'drather die here than be brought back and punished for crimes I nevercommitted. I'm a very patient man,T'Pol. I was simply waitingfor you to leave, but your Captain's curiosity has put an end to that. Would you please lower your weapon? I don't want to harm T'Pol, Captain, but I will. At the moment, I'm a man who needs to survive. There's a lockerright next to you. I want you to both put your weapons down and thenwalk into it. You won't be hurt. T'Pol is my guarantee that the two of you will walk quickly andquietly into the locker. Please. The locking code is onesix six one. There's a very specific tone when it's entered properly. Stop! Please! You're not going to shoot me, T'Pol. You're not going to killanother innocent man. This is none of your concern, Captain. You knownothing about what happened on Risa."

You know, as interesting as that was, it's always good to get home. Something wrong? Malcolm? What about it? None yet. I've already spoken to them. When was the last time you remember having it? After that. Did you have any reason to take it out of your pocket? Are you sure? We covered a lot of ground. It could be anywhere. Can you do a little better? We saw a lot of propaganda, but from what we could tell nobody started fighting yet. It's a good place to start. You've got the Bridge. Tell Doctor Phlox we're going to need his cosmetic services again. I appreciate the offer, Trip, but the fewer set of eyes, the better. Next time. We'll be in range of their surveillance towers in less than two minutes. Your feet ready for another hike? How about thirty years in the brig, or maybe a good flogging? It was an accident, Malcolm. It could have happened to any of us. This was the table? Try your scanner. Can you give us a few minutes? You have a good memory. I'll pass along the compliment. No, just visiting. Sounds good. Where? Were you in there? Better wait till they come out. I don't know. Still bothering you? I wouldn't count on it. I just hope they don't find the shuttlepod. I'm not sure anyone would believe us. Visitors from another world? There's no way to know how they'd react. The less we say the better. I'm the Captain. We're not part of the military. I don't know. I'm sorry. I can't help you. We're visitors, not spies. Our intelligence reports underestimate you, General. Alien creatures, You're even more delusional than we thought. This isn't a spaceship. It's suborbital. A highly experimental aircraft. We've been observing your territory for months. It's made from a composite alloy. Invisible to any of your tracking systems. We're prototypes, the only ones. All of them. An upset stomach? Do you really think he'd fall for that? Even if we got out of the compound, we'd never make it to the shuttle. Not looking like this. Genetic enhancements. Very creative, Malcolm. You made us sound like the Suliban. If I know T'Pol, she won't want to leave any contamination behind. It may take some time, but she'll find a way to get everything back. Including our remains. It's a big planet, Malcolm. I'm sure they're not all like that. What if we did tell them the truth? If we show them to the shuttlepod, bring the General up to Enterprise, give him the grand tour, top it off with dinner in the Captain's mess. We'd probably all have a good laugh over how he almost sent us to the gallows. I've gotten plenty of lectures on cultural contamination, but T'Pol never mentioned anything about sacrificing crewmen to prevent it. That was different. These people haven't even split the atom yet. The Vulcans waited until we were ready. Until we had the ability to travel to other stars. We're doing the right thing, Malcolm. I'm sorry you won't get a chance to write that report. He's my tactical officer. He can tell you everything you want to know about the Alliance's troop deployments, their weapons. You don't need to kill him. Don't leave without me. Let's go. Come in. Any planets? Sounds like a nice change of pace. Have Travis set a course. You took a risk coming down in that cell ship. Its cloaking device could have failed. I'm glad you did it. What's important is that we got everything back, the communicator, the phase pistol, the shuttlepod. We could have done a lot of damage to those people if we'd left any of it behind. We've changed their perception of the Alliance. And thanks to that Suliban ship, they also think the Alliance has developed invisible aircraft."

Seems only fitting. Am I that obvious? The speaker at the political rally, what was his name? Chancellor Kultrey? You could write a book about him alone. His speech reminded me of Winston Churchill before the Second World War. My communicator. It's gone. It's not in decon. Any luck? What about the launch bay crew? Could they have found it while they were securing the pod? I contacted T'Pol to let her know we'd entered the city. No. I'd remember. Either I dropped it or someone picked my pocket. This L-shaped structure. isn't that the fountain? The one with the statues. The tavern was directly across the street, here. The communicator could have slipped out of my pocket when we sat down. The hull plating's already been polarised. It's not a problem, sir. Captain. my carelessness was inexcusable. I'm prepared for whatever reprimand you feel is appropriate. Sir, Three military aircraft, seventy two kilometres off starboard. I suggest you increase our descent vector. That should keep us well below their visual threshold. Positive. I've got it. It's in a room, off that corridor. No. There are two people inside. I didn't have time to visit the doctor. I wonder if the guard would bring us some Epsom salts, if I asked politely. We came down to retrieve my communicator. Now we've lost two of them. Not to mention my phase-pistol and a pair of scanners. If they really think we are spying for this Alliance, perhaps we should consider telling them the truth. It couldn't hurt to try. Understood. We've been genetically enhanced. Our immune systems are resistant to chemical and biological weapons, and our internal organs have been modified to increase cellular regeneration by thirty percent. That way, our wounds can heal more quickly. Well, it may be an old trick where we come from, but maybe they haven't heard of it here. Thanks. Improvisation isn't my strong suit. What do you suppose Enterprise will do, after we're. It's ironic. Giving our lives to protect people who want to kill us. I'm not afraid, sir. You said it yourself, Captain. They'd never believe us. If we did tell them who we are, maybe it would do them a world of good. Look what the Vulcans did for Earth. It could still happen, sir. I'm expecting a rescue party to come barging through that door any moment. Captain. Sir, the phase pistol, our equipment. Sir, looking for this?"

164,ENT,episode 32,T'POL,"It's crucial we retrieve the technology. We can't risk contaminating a pre-warp culture. We'll have to take that risk. T'Pol to Captain Archer. Captain, please respond. Close the channel. Try to isolate their biosigns. I want to know exactly where they are. Any closer and we'd be detected. Do your best. If you were captured, you'd be giving the inhabitants more technology. It would undoubtedly affect the evolution of their society. Work quickly. I suggest we monitor the communiquÃ©s coming from the compound. They may tell us what's happening to the Captain and Mister Reed. How soon can you launch? You don't have time. They're going to be executed in less than two hours. You're about to find out. Prepare it for launch. We'll be in range of those surveillance towers in less than two minutes. Three military aircraft off our port side. They're on an intercept course. Commander. I scanned the region ahead. There's a blue giant cluster three light years from our current position. None that are inhabited. Yes, sir. Was there something else? A calculated risk. We did do damage to those people. They now believe their enemy is capable of creatinggenetically-enhanced soldiers, not to mention particle weapons. You don't have to leave technology behind to contaminate a culture. You were willing to sacrifice your life to protect them. I would not have expected that."
165,ENT,episode 32,TUCKER,"Didn't you say something about a war brewing down there? You could use another set of eyes down there, Captain. I'm a regular bloodhound. I'm telling you, something's gone wrong. We should hail them. Did you get a fix on the signal? That's more than thirty kilometres from the tavern. Where's the shuttlepod? They couldn't have travelled that far on foot. Not that fast. If there was a change of plan, they would've told us. We'd have more luck if we moved into a lower orbit. We could take Shuttlepod two, set it down here. They're being held less than thirty metres away. We'd be back in orbit before anyone knew they were gone. What if they didn't see us coming? We've still got that Suliban cell-ship, the one we used to rescue Klaang from the Helix. I've been working on it in my free time. I'm pretty close to figuring out how it works. If I can bring the cloak on line, we can get past their defences, grab our people, and no one will see a thing. I could use a hand. I don't get it. The power converter's engaged. Juice is definitely flowing through these relays. So why can we still see the ship? I've identified every other component. It's got to be it. Run the power-up sequence again. Hold on a minute, Travis. Just got the wind knocked out of me a bit. It tingles a little. How's that? They feel all right. What's your scanner say? Are you saying I'm permanently cloaked? Eventually? What am I supposed to do in the meantime? I can't work like this. Thanks. Reconnect the diffraction relays and we'll give it another shot. Still missing in action. I could probably become a world-class magician. Let's try it again. Go ahead. Not exactly. Shut her down. The cloaking generator's running at a hundred and ten percent, and it's still not enough. Let's route more power from the warp relays. Maybe that will do the trick. We're still reconfiguring the power matrix but I'm pretty confident We'll get it working on our way down if we have to. Look, invisible or not, this cell ship can take more of beating than our shuttlepod. They'll never see us coming. There's a power drain in the cloaking generator. Are the warp relays offline? The weapon nodes are active. I thought we diverted power from the secondary systems. They may have been programmed to reactivate when we launched. Travis, can't you hold this thing steady? Stand by. Your ride's here. Captain? Yeah? What about this? Maybe nothing to you. Thanks, Doc. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek Â® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

It's difficult to determine, but I suspect your appendage will eventually re-materialise on its own. Come back in an hour. I'll check on your progress. I'd also recommend a fresh uniform.

I did everything but tear up the floor plating. I think I can narrow down the search, Captain. An inverse carrier wave should amplify its power signature. With any luck, I'll be able to isolate it. I'm getting something. I've got it down to two square kilometres. I'll try. I've isolated the signal to within three city blocks. That's the best I can do, sir. If they're in a public place, the communicator would draw attention. The comm. line's open. Somewhere in this district. It hasn't moved. Maybe they took a train or a car. There are nearly a hundred thousand people in that part of the city. They're here, inside this compound. Right away. Sub-Commander, another communiquÃ©. It's from a General Gosis to the Chancellor.

Are you all right? Maybe a little more than that. Any change? Having a cloaked hand could have its advantages. Be useful in a poker match. It might be helpful on movie night, if you bring a date. In case you want to steal some popcorn. Is it working? What was that? Primary and backups. We did. It'd be a lot easier if they stop firing at us. The shuttlepod's right where you left it, sir.

303,ENT,episode 32,PELL,Does this belong to you? What is it? What kind of weapon is this? Where's General Gosis? Send a level four communiquÃ© and tell him I think we've found a pair of enemy spies. Take them to the Complex and put your men on alert. You won't be seeing your friends in the Alliance for a long time. Follow me. General. His blood. It's red. It's some kind of coherent energy pulse. I thought this technology was only theoretical. May I? Create the perfect soldier. The Alliance could have thousands of soldiers with these mutations.
304,ENT,episode 32,SOLDIER,On the Eastern perimeter. On your feet.
305,ENT,episode 32,GOSIS,"Which of you is the Captain? Something unexpected happened when I was examining this transmitter. It began to make a sound, so I opened it. Someone calling herself T'Pol seemed very concerned about her Captain's well-being. Which one of you was she trying to contact? The Alliance must be growing desperate if they're recruiting military officers as spies. I suppose you're the Captain of a pleasure boat. This transceiver, what's its frequency, its range? This appears to be a computing instrument. Tell me, how does it work? My superiors expect answers. As an officer, I'm sure you can appreciate that. I have no desire to harm you, but I need you to cooperate. I trust you enjoyed the rally this morning. That's why you're here, isn't it? It's curious, the two of you visiting the city the same day as Chancellor Kultarey. Did you come here to observe his security arrangement? Or perhaps assassinate him? We're aware of your ancestral claims against our city. It must make a tempting target. This T'Pol who tried to contact you, where is she? You've been surgically altered. Take them to Temec. Have him perform a full examination. Shall we try this? Our Alliance friends seem to have turned theory into reality. There appears to be another setting. If the Alliance has equipped its troops with these weapons. Make sure the devices are kept under guard at all times. Use men you can trust. What did you find? How is this possible? Doctor Temec tells me your deformities are not the work of a surgeon. He found no obvious incisions or scar tissue. You're even more abnormal on the inside. A redundant renal organ and you're missing four thoracic vertebrae. Temec can't even begin to explain this mass. As for your red blood, the doctor tells me your haemoglobin is based on iron, a toxic element. He conducted the test four times to be certain. He has a theory about where you came from. I found it difficult to believe until I saw this. One of our surveillance aircraft took this image early this morning. The pilot said the object was traveling at very high speed. Can you explain? Our scientists tell me it's unlikely that a craft of this size could have travelled from another star system. They suspect a larger ship must be somewhere nearby. Perhaps orbiting our planet. Tell me your orders! Have you made contact with the Alliance? Answer me. How did you evade our surveillance towers? And your biological anomalies? What kind of enhancements? How many of you are there? And your devices, are they prototypes as well? Take them back. Do you believe them? We need to verify what they've told us. You'll be in charge of the execution. I'll inform the prisoners."
306,ENT,episode 32,TEMEC,"See for yourself. There's only one explanation. Our prisoners belong to another species. None of the other planets in our system are capable of supporting life. Where do you come from? It's a plausible explanation. I ran every imaginable test. If I were to extract the organs, I could study them in more detail."

How long would it take to reach the system at impulse? Set a course. Trip. If you've got some freetime, I'd love it if you take a look at my chair. The Captain's chair.  It's uncomfortable. When I lean back I feel like I'm about toslide out of it. I have to sort of perch on the edge. Take a look at it for me? The chair first, if you don't mind. Come in. Morning. No, no. Just thinking about something. Thanks. I'll drop by the Armoury. Anything else? Is it serious? If it's all right with Chef. Let me ask you a question. Ireceived a manuscript from Earth. A biography of my father. I've beenasked to write the preface. Would you mind reading it when I'm done? If I can ever get it finished. I've been putting it off forweeks. It's not that I haven't had the time. They only asked for apage. How am I supposed to sum up my father's life in a page? Itwould've been easier if they'd asked me to write the book. A logical approach. Maybe you'd like to write it for me? You asked to see me, Malcolm? It's no problem. What's on your mind? And you have a proposal? I appreciate your concern, Malcolm, but this isn't a warship. I can see that. Run this by the senior officers, get somefeedback, and we'll talk again. And Malcolm, don't call it battle stations. Think of somethingless aggressive. Tthe tables are full with people eating frombowls, using chop sticks. Hoshi is walking amongst them.) When I was about eight years old, my father took me on a tourof the Warp Five facility outside of Bozeman, Montana. He introduced meto the people he worked with. Scientists with names like Tasaki andCochrane. At the time, I didn't realise the significance of those namesor the significance of my father's work. Computer,pause. I'll feed you in a minute. Computer, resume recording. In a way,creating a stable warp field mirrored the, the flux of emotions myfather felt when he embarked on. Computer, pause. Delete the lastparagraph. Hell, delete the whole thing. Quiet. What happened to my chair? Is that why you called me down here? Isn'tthat used for aligning phase coils? As long as I'm down here, maybe Ican get your opinion. How does one measure a man's legacy? Is itdefined by the works he's created, the technological advances that willforever alter the course of human history? If so, then no man since Zephram Cochrane, himself has made amore lasting contribution to the future of humankind than my father,Doctor Henry Archer. What do you think? Let me read you the rest. It's just a few more pages. Nineteen. I've got a lot to say. What's that supposed to mean? You're lucky you're a decent engineer because you obviouslydon't know anything about writing. Where's lunch? I don't have a minute. Report! Shut off that damn noise. Shut it off. I don't recallauthorising a tactical drill. What? Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't care what colour the headrest is, or whether it can serve meiced tea. I just want a place to sit when I'm on duty. And if I hear that alarm one more time I may have youtaken out and shot. Unless there's a real emergency, like areactor breach, I don't want to be disturbed. Go away. Do I have to start locking mydoor? Is that right? I'm busy. Dismissed. I gave you an order. I suggest you follow it, or I'll have you confined to yourquarters, until, until a Vulcan ship can come and get you. I told you not to disturb me. What are you doing? What? The one with the black hole? Turn it off. Yes. Radiation. Tell Phlox, if the the crew's sick. Tell Phlox. But not you? Bring us about. Turn the ship around. Lousy coffee. Travis. I'm in no condition to fly a starship. But you said bearing two point four. My mistake. Twelve point four. How much longer is this going to take? I'm good for that. Hold on, hold on. Zero what? Mark two-seven. Hang on a second. I feel like I'm in flight school again. I see it. We need phasecannons. Fire! Could you shutthat off? Any more surprises? How's the crew? What procedure on Mister Mayweather? I did. When T'Pol and I were navigating the debris field yourTactical Alert went off. You shouldn't have. They brought the weapons online right whenwe needed them. If you have no objection I'd like to make it standardprocedure. You still need to work on that alarm. It doesn't look any different to me. It feels better. What'd you do? What did you do? It seems totally different. That's all? I think this'll be fine, Commander. Thanks. This'll be fine.

I've been reviewing our encounters with hostile species. Thecrew's response has been admirable but I feel we can do better, sir. I've been thinking about a ship wide emergency alert. Something abit more comprehensive than battle stations. We're taking far too longto react to potential threats. With a single order from you, or animpact to the hull, the plating could be polarised, weapons broughtonline, critical systems secured. That's obvious, sir. During our last run-in with the Suliban wewere unprepared for their boarding parties. When the Mazarites attackedthey disabled our aft sensors with their first shot. The list goes on. Yes, sir. Condition Red? What about Condition Red for the new security protocol? Well, that's not very dynamic. I beg your pardon? Just what the captain needs in a crisis, a place to rest hisbeverage. If you really want to improve tactical readiness, why don't youhelp me with this protocol? It's a chair. Reed Alert. That's not bad. It was lovely. That's not necessary. Please. Not hungry. Well it was a bit salty. Well, it just must be me, then. Everybody else seems to beenjoying it. I've been working on the new security protocol. Obviously, thereactor must be secured immediately during a Tactical Alert. I considered your suggestion, Reed Alert, but it seemed a bitnarcissistic. I've also been working on a new alert signal. Tell me what youthink. Or this one? Well, which do youprefer? A Tactical Alert. Well, they were designed to get your attention. I also need your help on an emergencyshutdown procedure for the grid. Fine. Let's hope we don't suffer a catastrophic reactor breach inthe meantime. Clearance code. What is your clearance code? The Armoury is a restricted area. How do I know you are the First Officer? We've encounteredspecies that can alter their appearance. They could masquerade as anyone of us. I've issued codes to all senior officers to reveal if theship's been infiltrated by impostors. It was sent to your console as a voice-encrypted command packet. Why do you want to access the sensor array from your quarters? I wasn't informed. From now on, security personnel are to wear side arms in allrestricted areas. It's in my proposal. I've been trying to get him to pay closer attention to securitysince we left spacedock, but he's more interested in fraternising withthe crew. Inviting them to breakfast, and to watch water polo. I intendto implement some long-overdue changes, and if the Captain won'tapprove them then I'll go directly to Starfleet Command. Was thereanything else? This is a Tactical Alert. All hands report to your stations. I repeat, this is a Tactical Alert. The crew's response wasunacceptable. Thirty eight percent of them failed to report to theirstations. Critical systems haven't been secured. I haven't even heardfrom Engineering. It wouldn't be much of a drill if everybody knew about it, sir. One minute and fifteen seconds. It took you one minute and fifteen seconds to reach your post. I'd expect more of our Commanding Officer given that the crew justmight follow his example. One minute and forty nine seconds. You ignored a tactical alert for this? This is all a big joke to you. This isn't a bloody pleasure cruise. Without proper discipline onthis ship, this mission is doomed. If this were a military situation you'd be taken out and shot. You wanted to see me, Captain? I heard, sir. I've already deactivated the new protocols. No objection, sir. I'll get right on it.Â "

320,ENT,episode 33,T'POL,"Science officer's log, August 14, 2152. Enterprise remainson course for the trinary system. I've transmitted a distress call butthe nearest Vulcan ship is more than nine days away. By the time theyarrive, they may only find debris, if that. Even if Enterprise makes itpast the black hole without being destroyed, it seems likely the crewwon't survive. I'm continuing my analysis of the conditionthat's stricken the crew. Without Doctor Phlox's assistance I'm nothopeful about reversing its effects. I'm documenting my findings sothat Starfleet will at least have a record of what happened. Thesymptoms began not long after we set a course for the trinary system. That was nearly two days ago. A class four. That's correct, but none of them were part of a trinary starsystem. The gravitational shear between the stars is extreme. We'd haveto drop to impulse, but we should be able to approach to within fivemillion kilometres. Two days. Good morning. Am I interrupting? Today's duty roster. Lieutenant Reed has a new security protocol he'd like to discusswith you. Chef didn't report for duty this morning. He's ill. Doctor Phlox said it's a simple virus. He should be fine after afew days' rest. Ensign Sato has offered to take charge of the messhall. Apparently, she spends some of her free time in the Galley and iseager for an opportunity to cook for the crew. I'd be happy to. The next two days should provide you with ample opportunity. Perhaps by focusing on one incident, a single event thatexemplifies your relationship with your father, you'll be able tocondense your thoughts. I'm hardly qualified. Commander. Commander. Commander. Perhapsyou could finish that later. He also requested detailed sensor readings of this trinarysystem. We also have sensitive hearing. I'll be in my quarters. Come in. This trinary system is emitting some unusual radiation. I'mtrying to identify it. Correct. I said it was important. I prefer to work here. I'll need your assistance with this. Are you feeling all right, Commander? Lieutenant, I need your I beg your pardon? Even to the First Officer? Part of your new security protocol? I haven't been to the Bridge for several hours. As I was saying,I need assistance establishing a sensor interface in my quarters. I'veasked Commander Tucker, but he became agitated. It wasuncharacteristic, even for him. Have you noticed anything abnormalabout his behaviour? I was asked to run detailed scans of the trinary star system. It isn't a tactical issue. Lieutenant, why are you armed? Have you cleared this with the Captain? Has he approved your proposal? No. It wasn't long before I realized the odd behaviour wasn'tlimited to Commander Tucker. In fact, everyone I encountered was actingstrangely, growing consumed with matters that seemed trivial at best. Ialso discovered that although I appeared to be immune, the Captain wasnot. All I requested was a bowl of Plomeek broth. Captain? May I speak with you? You said to interrupt you if there was an emergency. I believethere is. The crew's behaviour has become erratic. Even by humanstandards, they've grown distracted. Everyone I've encountered appearsto be preoccupied with trivial matters. Ensign Sato's recipe, forexample. Your preface. We should declare a medical emergency and haveDoctor Phlox examine the crew. I suggest he begin with you. Captain. Your crew is in danger. Captain. Was he injured? Doctor, you may want to delay the procedure. We have a largerproblem. The entire crew is ill. You've beenaffected, as well. The crew's bio-signs were growing erratic. I began to doubtany of them would survive more than a few hours. Ironically,Dr. Phlox's obsession with Ensign Mayweather's headache has providedsome useful data. His cerebral scans have helped me determine that theradiation coming from the trinary system is causing Computer, pause. Computer, resume log. My radiometric analysis is complete. As Isuspected, reversing course won't take us out of danger quickly enough. The radiation appears to extend outward at least half a light year inevery direction except one. If I can chart a course between the starswe could escape the radiation before the crew succumbs. But I won't beable to pilot the ship alone. Captain? Captain Archer! You're needed on the Bridge. We have very little time. Your crew may be dying. Do you remember that trinary star system? It's emitting a dangerous form of radiation. It's affecting yourprefrontal cortex. I believe that'swhy you and the crew have been exhibiting obsessive behaviour. Some ofthe crew's biosigns are already unstable. If you're exposed to theradiation much longer you won't survive. Do you understand what I'mtelling you? Do you understand? He's been affected as well. Vulcan physiology seems to be immune. It's not that simple. If we go back the way we came we'll spendtwo more days in the radiation field. I've charted a course that'llhave us clear of the radiation in less than seventeen minutes. But we'll have to pass within two million kilometres of theblack hole. There's considerable debris and gravitational shear. Someone needs to pilot Enterprise while I determine the coursecorrections. He's been sedated. We have no other choice. More gravitational shear. We're too far to port. Twelve point four. Six minutes. Another shear front. We need to rotate our longitudinal axis bytwelve degrees and bring our flight vector to zero one four mark twoseven. Zero one four mark. Just minor debris. The hull plating is holding. Our lateralvector is drifting. Captain! You're doing well. New heading. Zero zero six mark four. Captain! They'd take too long to charge. All weapons are online. It must be part of the new securityprotocol. Less than ten seconds. Five more seconds. Nothing on sensors. I wasn't certain it would work on a Denobulan."
321,ENT,episode 33,TUCKER,"Close enough to get some nice pictures. Sir? Wh-What about it? Is there a problem? I always assumed it was the best seat in the house. I was going to purge the impulse manifolds. Aye, aye, sir. Push it forward. That's good, hold it there. This may not be as glamorous as a black hole, but the Captaingave me an order. I thought Vulcans had all this mental focus and discipline. We'll let you know when we're done. Huh? Why don't you just call it Security Protocol? Do you think a cup holder's too much? For the Captain's chair. He just wanted the seat adjusted but Ifigured as long as I'm working on it. I'm also upgrading the status displays. He'll be able to accesstactical data from the armrest. I'm a little busy right now, Malcolm. It's the Captain's chair. It's just as important as your ReedAlert. Yeah. Thanks. It was terrific. Well, it seems to be a big hit. Congratulations. Here's your sensor interface. What's the emergency? You dragged me up here so you could identify radiation? You said it was urgent. I get it. You're paying me back. Making me jump through hoopsbecause I was making too much noise. Well, you'll be happy to know Imoved the Captain's chair down to Engineering. So it's nice and quieton the Bridge now. Weren't you listening to me? I don't have time to cater to yourwhims. You want to get your name immortalized in the Vulcan database,get someone else to help you do it. I know you don't think this chair is important, but you'rewrong. What's the most critical component on this ship? The maincomputer? The warp reactor? Uh-uh, it's the crew. And the mostimportant member of the crew is the Captain. He makes life and deathdecisions every day and the last thing he needs to be thinking in acritical situation is, 'Gee, I wish this chair wasn't such a pain inthe ass.' Tactical Alert? Hand me that hyperspanner, would you? For what? They both sound like a bag full of cats. I'll lookthis over and get back to you. I said I'll get back to you. Malcolm. One of your boys borrowed my laser micrometer. Ifyou're heading to the Armoury, could you get it back for me? Did you know that this chair is the exact same model used onNeptune class survey ships? Enterprise is the first warp five vessel in human history, thepride of the fleet, and you're sitting in a chair they've been using onwarp two ships for over a decade. You deserve better, so I'm startingfrom scratch. I'm going to build you a throne. Stand right there. Ineed to get a few parametric scans to get your exact dimensions. Thisbaby is going to fit like a glove. You won't feel a thing. Don't move. Turn around. All done. Sounds good. I really need toget to work on this. How many more? Nineteen? Are you writing the preface or the book? No kidding. If I may, sir, it's a little longwinded. I'm not the only one. Captain. You might want to see this, sir. Interactive status displays, secondary helm control. It's evengot inertial micro-dampers. The ship could be shaking apart and you'dhardly feel a thing. I want to run some colours by you for the headrest. Give it a rest. Why don't you go play soldier somewhere else? Did we get some nicepictures of the black hole? Give it a try. Cross your legs. I lowered it, by one centimetre. Didn't have time to install the new status displays or theinertial micro-dampers, but if you give me a couple of days. How about I just attach the cup holder?"

Any other symptoms? Dizziness, blurredvision? How long have you had it? Well, I've been meaning to have you drop by Sickbay in anycase, to see if you've had any problems since I removed the neuralimplants you received at the repair station. Oh, I never rule out anything. Then again, it could be asinnocuous as muscular tension. On the other hand, Terrellian plaguestarts out with a simple headache, then all manner of nasty thingsbegin to happen. That depends. Hold still, Ensign. I'm afraid you won't be returning to duty today. When it comes to medical matters my authority overrides theCaptain's. I'm keeping you overnight for observation. That's what concerns me. Whatever's afflicting you may be layingdormant. I'm going to run a full biomolecular scan to see if we canfind where it's hiding. Now, lie back and don't move. Shush. Wait! I haven't discharged you, Ensign. I need to perform a cerebral micro-section. Lie down. I'm giving you an order. You have far more to worry about than a blemish on your record. Do you see there? Your cortical scan shows elevated levels of serotoninand several other neurotransmitters. I'll let you know once I've completed the micro-section. Absolutely not. And what if you're carrying a protocystian spore, and you infectthe rest of the crew? How will that reflect on you? Or what if yousuddenly suffer a seizure at the helm because you've contractedAndronesian encephalitis? Now there is something wrong with you,Ensign, and I intend to find out what it is. At least let me give you an analgesic for the headache. If it gets any worse, or you suffer any other symptoms, returnhere immediately. You're just in time, Sub-Commander. There's a surgical gown inthe compartment by the microscope. This is a rare opportunity toexplore the human brain. A headache. At first, I thought it was a simple vasculardilation but then I discovered a chemical imbalance in his prefrontalcortex. I'm going to begin by extracting the first twelve millimetresof his parietal lobe. A sub-cellular analysis of the tissue should shedsome light on the mystery. They'll have to wait. Please remove your hand. I won't ask you again. I'll letyou know when I've completed the surgery. How are you feeling? Very little, fortunately. You're free to go. Oh, I'm continuing to monitor vital signs. But I've detected nolingering effects from the radiation. Mostly just rattled nerves, a fewbruises and sprains from when some of them lost consciousness. Iappreciate your intervening before I got any further with MisterMayweather's procedure. It worked quite effectively, I can assure you. The radiation affected my nervous system rather severely. I'll be with you in a moment. I'll provide you witha full report when I've finished treating the crew."

Captain and I were in the same group. Alice Springs, Australia. Never saw so many flies in my life. Biting kind. Tucker. Travis was just telling me he'd like to see the ruins. I'll need a pilot to bring the other pod back. Never say I don't take you anywhere. Come on, Hoshi. You're upside down, Ensign. Didn't even tie us up. As soon as the Captain promised to givethem their stuff back they walked us to the shuttlepods and away wewent. Well, we're safe and sound. That's all that matters. Have youtried this thing? Considering that I've been back down to the surface, kidnappedand released, I've probably had better days. Why, are you not feelingwell? What kind of symptoms? Well, in that case, you're right. You shouldn't get on thisthing. The laws of physics don't apply in here, either. Sorry. Justtrying to cheer you up. It's going to be a while beforeany of us gets used to being taken apart and put back together again. It seems perfectly natural to be anxious about it. What else could it be? All the king's horses and all the king's men. I can see why youmight imagine the universe unraveling. If you're afraid you haven'tbeen put back together right, why assume anything else makes sense? IfI were you, I'd ask the Doc for a sedative. Nothing like crawling intobed. Wait and see. A night's sleep will do you a world of good. She was here last night, right over there. Have you tried the biosensors again, Captain? I'll go take a look at them. They're not aligning. They're not perfectly synchronised. Must've happened right after it came up from the surface. She didn't want to go first. I told her I wouldn't leave heralone with that storm coming but she insisted on going second. Shewanted to be sure it was working, that it was safe. I'm the one whoshould be missing. I told her to go first. She should've listened tome. Aye, sir. Is it Hoshi's or isn't it? The internal scan said access shaft B7. She's got to be heresomewhere. What's the problem? Here, Doc, over here. What do you think? Why would she have come down here? Yeah, both alive. You go ahead, Doc. I'm going to stick aroundfor a minute. Hoshi. I should've made you go first. What could I have been thinkingleaving you down there? I was the ranking officer, and I had nobusiness leaving a subordinate in the path of those storms. Why didn'tyou listen to me? I told you we'd be safe. And now look what you'vedone. What's the problem? Come on, Hoshi, come on. Nice work, Malcolm. See, I told you. Piece of cake. Who? Who? There's no one on the surface. It's uninhabited. You were sort of, trapped in the pattern buffer. But only for afew seconds. You insisted on going second. Cyrus who?"

487,ENT,episode 34,PHLOX,"Ensign. Something I can do for you? I was feeding my leeches. Are you all right? I'm right here, Ensign. Are you not feeling well? I heard about your ordeal on the surface. Those storms soundedterrifying. Come sit down. Let's take a look. It'lltake me a while to account for every molecule, but you appear to be inone piece. I don't think you're in danger of becoming the next CyrusRamsey. I spent nearly nine months on Earth, remember? Not a single bio-molecular anomaly. A subcutaneous pigmentation. Well, it looks lovely where it is now. I have a lot of animals to feed before bedtime. If I were you,I'd get a good night's sleep, hmm? Ensign? Is there something in particular you'd like me to look at? Well, I see you, Ensign, and the Sickbay doors responded whenyou came in. Transporter technology is very new. I'm surehumans were equally frightened when the automobile was introduced, orthe airplane. New forms of transport take a while to get used to. I'mnot at all surprised at your reaction. You wouldn't catch me using thatapparatus. But I can promise you one thing. You're in perfect health. You're neither transparent nor porous. As far as I'm concerned I didn't even see you come in here. I would like to give you a mild sedative. It'll help you get agood night's sleep. As you wish, but stop by in the morning, all right? She came to Sickbay after the incident withthe storm, then a second time early last night. She said she felt shaky. You're aware that was the first timeshe'd ever transported? I believed that was the source of her anxiety. She was convincedher molecules hadn't been reassembled properly. I should've taken hermore seriously. These are the biomolecular scans I took during each ofher two visits. Theyseemed perfectly normal at the time. When I heard she was missingsomething made me take a closer look. You see these protein filaments? Now look at this. Look how much her subcellular membranes have degraded. Thesescans were taken less than twenty four hours apart. It's virtuallyimpossible. If they're not perfectly synchronised? Captain, if there was a loss of molecular cohesion I'm afraid weshouldn't be looking for Hoshi, per se. Subcellular residue. There wouldn't be anything left by nowexcept for subcellular residue. There's no way to becertain this is her. It's difficult to tell. The amino acids have broken down. Try isolating the dipeptides. Now run a comparison with hergenetic profile. I doubt we'll ever know, Commander. Captain Archer will wantHoshi's parents to have this. They're both alive, aren't they? I understand. Actually, it probably happened in the last one or two seconds asyour matter stream was coalescing. She seems fine."
488,ENT,episode 34,MOORE,
489,ENT,episode 34,HOSHI,"These are at least three hundred years older than the ones inthe last chamber. No. How about you? You're a budding linguist. Let's get a shot of that one. I wonder what happened to them. Captain, these ruins have very thick walls. I'm sure we'll be safe inside. But sir, these buildings are Over four thousand years old. I'm surethey've survived hundreds of these storms. Couldn't we wait it out inside the shuttle? Polarise the hullplating. Have you ever done this? Your molecules get pulled apart. Do you know how many molecules you're made up of? All right, how many? That's a pretty big jigsaw puzzle. What if some other pieces getput in the wrong place? You know, I bet a lot of them look realsimilar. Okay, okay, but you go first and if you get to Enterprise in onepiece I'll be right behind you. Commander? I'm on my way, sir. Ensign Sato ready for transport. I'll let you know. Come in. I guess you could say that, sir. I'll be at my post in a fewminutes. I just want to clean up and change. Thank you. Sir? I'm sure Commander Tucker can find someone else to hold thesecond flash unit. I don't want to get lost. Too much excitement for one day. I could really use some rest,sir. Anyone sitting here? Is anyone sitting here? It was very unsettling. Didn't you find it unsettling? I don't know. I just don't feel right. Not the storms, it's the transporter. I don't feel like myselfsince I went through it. I need to check the medical database and findout what happened to people they used when they were testing thatthing. Cyrus Ramsey? Am I supposed to? What happened to him? What happened to him? I must have fallen asleep before the ghost stories. See you later. Doctor? Doctor Phlox. Hello? I just looked in there. Were you in there? Did you hear me comein? You didn't hear me? No, I'm not feeling well. I dematerialised, and then Irematerialised and, no, I'm not feeling well. Doctor, I'm not talking about the storms. I'm talking about mymolecules. Don't tell me they talk about him on Denobula. I just don't feel right. Ever since the transport, I've beenshaky, not myself. No? How about this? It's not where it used to be. It was a good centimetre lower. It's not a joke, Doctor. If that machine could move a birthmark,who knows what else it could do. I'm telling you, I don't feel right. Hello? What time is it? Eleven hundred hours, that's impossible. My shift starts at oheight hundred. I'm sorry, Captain, I don't know whathappened. Taken hostage by who? People? There wasn't a biosign on the planet. How could you possibly know that? It's Mayweather's communicator. I need more. I'm sorry, sir, it's not working. I'm going to need more. Ajas sukas. Tag zra uras turana. If I went back to the universal translator, maybe I could I can't. I know. I don't understand what he's saying. I'm, I'm sorry. I'msorry. Captain, I realise I overslept. I don't know how it happened,but please, I don't want to go back to my quarters. Anyone sitting here? Sub-commander? Thank you. I would've thought you'd be on the Bridge. Commander Tucker. Travis. It's only been an hour since I left the Bridge. What happened? I don't understand. How? That's impossible. I ran every linguistic algorithm. If we've decrypted their language, I should get back to theBridge. It sounds like the Captain might want to speak with them again. Alison. What? Can you see me? Can you see me? Something's wrong, Doctor. Something's very wrong. Ever since Iused that transporter nothing has been the way that it's supposed tobe. I couldn't translate a simple, bi-modal syntax, but Crewman Bairdcould. Crewman Baird doesn't know the first thing about our linguisticdatabase. And Captain Archer told me to stay in my quarters, but mymirror doesn't want to give me a solid reflection and my shower can'tdecide whether to bounce off me or go through me. Nobody wants to talkto me. Sometimes I think they don't even see that I'm there. Theturbolift control won't even respond to me. You won't put this on my medical record, will you? Not funny, Doctor. If it's all the same to you the last thing I need right now isto be medicated. First thing. Thank you, Doctor. I was taught never to contradict a superior officer. The Captaintold me what happened. Did they treat you all right? I'm sorry I wasn't more helpful trying to translate. I don'tknow what happened. I get motion sickness, remember? Have you felt okay since wewere transported yesterday? Ididn't think I was, but the doctor seems to feel my symptoms arepsychological. I just haven't been myself. Everything's a little off ,even thelaws of physics. It's okay. Phlox promises me I'll be fine. I hope it's just a question of beinganxious. I saw my reflection become transparent. I saw water pass rightthrough my hand. I'm not convinced that the transporter put me back theway it was supposed to. You men are all alike. Thank God you're here. I've been stuck in here for hours. Thedoor control is Commander. Yes, she is. It wasn't your fault. You're wrong, Doctor. I'm still in one piece. You just can't seeme. Don't waste your time. It's not me. If you spent a little more time trying to figure out whathappened to Lieutenant? You can see me? Captain, I need you to listen to me. There are aliens on boardfrom the surface. They're planting bombs on D deck. You've got to hearme. The ship is in danger. You don't have time for this. I'll find something that'll get your attention. We're all going to be dead if I don't get him to notice this. How about Morse code? You know Morse Code, don't you? Come on, listen. Can you hear it? Come on. That's right, show it to her. One of you will figure it out. Let's see how good your memory is. H, O, S, H, I. Come on. I'm not outside this room, I'm right here. Tomorrow's too late. They're going to blow up the ship. Captain! No, wait! What? Where are they? We've got to stop them. You heard me? You can hear me? Do you see me? It's not fine. They put a bomb on the warpreactor. The aliens from the surface. What are you talking about? They kidnapped you and Travis. We'vegot to stop them. Trouble? Are you saying that I was just on the surface? Do you have a mirror? Forget it. And I was sure I was going to be the next CyrusRamsey. So you're sayingall of that happened in eight seconds? Well, I hope you don't plan on beaming me anywhere for a longtime. I was trying to save Enterprise. It's all in my head, remember? If it's all the same to you, sir, I'd like to stick toshuttlepods for the time being. Captain, if you don't mind. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

They said they were having trouble with one of their lifesupport systems. Welcome aboard. This is Sub-Commander T'Pol and my Chief Engineer, CommanderTucker. Stasis? Is she injured? I understand. T'Pol will show you to guest quarters. Whenyou're done, I'll have my chef prepare you a meal. Come in. I'm sure we'll manage. Please. T'Pol tells me yourvessel can't do much better than warp two. I've been making some calculations. If I'm not mistaken, atwarp four point five Enterprise can have you at your destination inless than four days. It's no inconvenience. We're out here to meet new people. You're heading toward an inhabited world we've never seen. Firstcontacts tend to go more smoothly when a familiar face is making theintroductions. You could dock in our launch bay. You wouldn't have to worryabout that stasis pod. We have plenty of room for you and yourpassenger. Problem? Not at all. Archer to Commander Tucker. Trip, can you hear me? Archer to Lieutenant Reed. Secure the docking clamps. Report. Hail him. Phase cannons. Target his engines. Bring us into grappling range. Hail him again. T'Pol? Stay with him. I thought you took out one of his nacelles? He's your partner. You must have some ideawhere he's going. You don't even know what system you were heading for? If that's true, then we could work together to track him down. We've got pretty good long range sensors, but your ship couldbe anywhere within a half dozen light years. It'd be a lot easier if weknew your warp frequency. Take him back to Docking Port Two. Put him in the airlock andpost a security detail. We'll keep the outer hatch unlocked. If you decide to leave,you know the way out. Thank you. Not right now, Lieutenant. Dismissed. Have a seat. Sit down. We're not here to talk about your partner. We're here to talkabout you. You're facing some very serious charges, Mister Plinn. Where wecome from criminals are held accountable for their actions. If they'refound guilty, they're punished. This is where your tribunal is going totake place. That's not for me to decide. Starfleet asked the Vulcan High Command to assign a judicialadministrator to Enterprise. Someone who wouldn't be swayed by humanemotion. Someone objective, logical. From what I understand,Sub-commander T'Pol has already reviewed the evidence. This tribunal isnothing more than a formality. I thought you should be prepared. Herpunishments can be severe. If you're late for your shift you might receive a beating. Butfor more grievous offenses, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming anofficer. We started out with eighty three crewmen on board. We're downto seventy six. Accessory to kidnapping, resisting arrest, obstruction of aninvestigation, causing damage to a Starfleet vessel. When your partner fled he released a cloud of dilithiumhydroxls that clogged our plasma vents. As I said, I'm not the one you have to convince. Sub-commander. Yes, ma'am. He's got a point. We've never tried an alien before. Maybe weshould contact the High Command.Â T'POL As you wish. There's nothing I can do. She owes me a few favours. I can't promise anything but I, I'dbe willing to ask for leniency. Of course, I'd want something inreturn. We still haven't found a way to locate your vessel. If youcould remember that warp frequency. Trip? This a bad time? Captain's Star log, September 12th, 2152. We'verendezvoused with a Krios battle cruiser, which has taken thekidnappers into custody."

I've got some conduits that might do the trick. This would be a lot easier if I could read your language. Ifyou don't mind, I'd like to ask our Communications Officer to give me ahand. No. No, no problem. I'm going to need some tools fromEnterprise. With a little luck, Sleeping Beauty here will never knowthere was a problem. Is that the translation? Thanks. Hell of a way to travel, isn't it? I asked Plinn but he doesn't seem to know too much about her. He said something about studying medicine in a research colony. I suppose so. She must have a real passion for it if she'swilling to go through all this. Shame we'll never get to meet her. What's that supposed to mean? I wasn't staring. Hoshi? Are you all right? Help me open this thing! She's suffocating! The release is jammed. Don't bother. I'm sorry about this, but the O2 recycler went offline. You're going to be all right.

They claimed you were theirpassenger. Should I? Well, I'm afraid Earth isn't one of them. So I take it you'renot a doctor. Oh. Charles Tucker the third. Please to meet you. So what dothese guys want? Listen, my Captain'll be looking for me. All we have to do isget off this ship and let him know where we are. I saw a shuttlebay earlier. There were a couple of escape pods. I beg your pardon? Well, if it's all the same to you I'd rather take my chances inopen space. If I remember right this access tube leads to a junction nearthe shuttlebay. With all due respect, I'm not one of your subjects. Could you hand me that circuit probe? The one with the greenhandle? You must be one hell of a diplomat. No, just me. That's precisely why I'm getting out of here. I really doubtthey're going to keep me around once I fix their problem. You know, Irealise someone in your position isn't used to taking advice from a guylike me, but I strongly suggest you come along. I've been involved in a few hostage situations. They rarelyturn out the way you expect. You know, that stasis pod won't fix itself. Chances are you'regoing to spend the next five months tied up in this grimy little cargohold. Not exactly my idea of a royal voyage. When I get back to Enterprise I'll make sure we get a messageto your homeworld. Krios? Take care. I'm going to reroute their internal sensors. I'll be a millionkilometres away before they know I'm gone. I'm much better company. Just a few more metres. Keep your voice down. What am I supposed to call you, anyway? First Monarch? Your Highness? What is that? Some kind of a title? These lead to internal sensors. We don't have all day. We'll have to make do. Unless you know how to fly one of thesethings. We're crossing the subspace threshold. That wasn't so bad. To be honest, I hadn't really thought about it. I was only joking. They do have a sense of humour where youcome from? It's only a matter of time before they realise we're gone. Nodoubt they'll come about and look for us. We need a place to hide. If I'm translating this right, there's a system about ninetymillion kilometres from here. We should be able to reach it in a day orso. Only one way to find out. Permission to set a course, yourSovereignty? Look, this would be a whole lot easier if you'd stop movingaround. I'm afraid I don't have much choice. You're welcome to step outside until I'm done. Excuse me. There we go. Landing thrusters, No, wait, they're stabilisers. I'm working on it. Look, I've got less than twenty four hours to figure out how toscan a star system and programme a descent sequence in a language Idon't understand, and I'm not going to get it done with youinterrupting me every five seconds. So I'd appreciate it if you'd keepquiet until I'm finished. Now, lift your butt. Your behind, your rear end. I haven't checked that panel yet. You know, you were a lot more pleasant in stasis. I think I found the landing thrusters. I understand howdifficult this must be for someone of your upbringing, but we could bestuck out here for awhile. We should find a way to get along. I'mwilling to give it a try if you are. You might check that storage compartment above your head. I'm busy. If you find any water up there, I could use some. Thanks. Allow me. I'm not contagious. Depends how hungry you are. It reminds me of my first car. A four-wheeled vehicle. Wasn't much bigger than this. All we'remissing is the ocean breeze coming off the Gulf. I used to drive out toa place called Chatkin Point, park along the shoreline and stare at themoon with my girlfriend. Don't worry. I won't make a pass at you. You must be a fun date. You've never been on a date? Sounds kind of lonely. There's a chain of islands near the equator. Oxygen, nitrogen, a trace of methane. Nothing we can't handle. If I could figure out how to use the bio-sensors. It's the only one with an atmosphere. Let's hope I get this right. We're entering thethermosphere. The port stabiliser's down. No, but the starboard one should keep us on course. So far so good. Eight thousand metres. I think they're metres. Seven thousand. I'm pretty sure the braking thrusters are firing. Fivethousand metres. You might want to grab hold of something. Two thousand metres. One thousand. Hold on. You all right? Damned if I know. It's nothing compared to a summer in the Everglades. At leastthere aren't any mosquitoes. Over there. Looks like a good place to set up camp. Don't underestimate Captain Archer. It's just a scratch. I'll take care of it later. I said later. This one. It sounds like there's plenty of wildlife. I grew up in a placekind of like this. I don't think we're going to starve. And I can usethe thruster assembly from the pod to start a fire, boil some water. Thanks. That's the best you could do? Keep looking. What are you waiting for? What's that supposed to mean? In case you haven't noticed, we're not in a palace. You said ityourself. You won't survive without my help, so it seems to me that I'mthe one in charge. The king of the swamp. Now get your ass out thereand don't come back without an armful of dry wood. You should give me a medal. You'd be dead if it weren't for me. I doubt the commoners back home would complain. You're the one who took a swing at me. I'm just a petty commoner, remember? Raised on a primitive, A homing beacon. Unless I'm way off, someone just locked on toit. No way to tell.Â  Let's find his weapon. So, when do you ascend? It's a long shot, but maybe Enterprise will get the chance tovisit Krios Prime before then. Of course, from what you've told me Idoubt your family would let me see you. What kind of changes?"

791,ENT,episode 35,GOFF,"Gracious of you to help us, Captain. We were beginning to thinkour distress call would never be answered. We were hired to return a young woman to her home world. A fewdays ago her stasis pod began to malfunction. No, no. She's a passenger, but our ship is designed to haulcargo, not people and it's a very long journey. Putting her insuspended animation was our only choice. You've been very accommodating. If it's not too much trouble I'dlike to make another request. It's been a long time since we've enjoyedthe luxury of a bath. I hope I didn't deplete your water supply. Warp two point two. That's a generous offer, but I've already inconvenienced you fartoo much. I'm sure you'll do fine on your own. It's not that simple, Captain. This has all been carefullyprearranged. Her family's not expecting her for another five months. They're not even on her home world at the moment. But I will acceptyour offer of a meal, if it's not too late. The stasis pod. It's malfunctioning. If you'll excuse me, Captain. I know the way.Â  What are you doing? We can't bring her out of stasis."
792,ENT,episode 35,GOSS,There's a minor problem. I'm going to need your assistance. The malfunction is more complicated than I expected. Is it repaired? The stasis pod. Your ship is a long way from here. Repair the pod so we can put her back in stasis. Work quickly.
793,ENT,episode 35,PLINN,"Our salvation. We have another five months ahead of us. If she wakes up therewon't be enough food, air to breathe. If we're forced to abort themission we won't get paid. Please. This regulates power flow to the biopod. These relays are from an old Ardanan shuttle. They weren'tdesigned to carry this much current. By all means. Is there a problem? Yes? What kind of problem? I'll be there in a moment. I don't mean to be rude. That's right. That won't be necessary. Have I done something wrong? I never realised leaving the Captain's table would cause so muchconcern. Obviously, I'm his victim as well. Why else would he leave mehere? Goff had the coordinates. It wasn't my responsibility. He was piloting the ship, not me. Ispent most of my time looking after the cargo. Believe me, Captain I'mas eager to find my partner as you are. I don't see how. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I know very littleabout warp engines. I'm telling you the truth! Why have I been brought here? I already told you everything I know. What about me? Tribunal? I am not subject to your laws. How severe? But I haven't done anything wrong. What damage? I had nothing to do with that. What? Seventy two kilograms. One point eight metres. Why are you asking these questions? This is not fair. I demand to speak with someone from mygovernment. You can't allow this. But you're the Captain."

Explain yourself. What do you know about my abductors? I am their prisoner. I was returning from a diplomaticmission when they attacked my transport, murdered my guards. You don'tknow who I am, do you? My family is known on hundreds of worlds. I am First Monarch of the Sovereign Dynasty of Krios Prime. Ransom. No doubt they'll demand a high price for my safereturn. And how do you propose we do that? You're not going anywhere. We'll remain here until they contact the Sovereign Guard. Once the ransom has been paid, we'll be released. It's too dangerous. If you leave, it would provoke them. You are not to leave this chamber. Is your entire species so ill-mannered? You know, if you were thinking rationally you'd be repairingthat stasis pod. He did threaten to kill you. He'd never harm me. I'm too valuable to them. You're correct, Mister Tucker. I don't take advice frompeople like you. I'll be fine. Krios Prime. Once you launch an escape pod what makes you think they won'tdestroy it? How much farther? Are you sure this is the right direction? Kaitaama. It's my name. What are you doing? This is meant for one person. What was that? What do you propose we do next? I assumed you had a plan. Among the commoners. Only joking. Where? What makes you think any of those planets are habitable? Proceed. You're touching me. It's inappropriate to touch the First Monarch. You have no idea how to control this vehicle. Even if we do find a breathable atmosphere and you manage toland without killing us, what will we do about food? Water? There couldbe hostile lifeforms on the surface. How will we protect ourselves? My what? Quickly. My hand. You're sitting on my hand. I'll try. Are there any provisions? I'm hungry. You do it. Is it edible? Car? The Sovereign Guard would cut off one of your hands. The First Monarch doesn't socialise with the opposite sex. Four years ago, before I was selected to ascend to FirstMonarch, I was courted by young men from many noble families. Now Ispend my personal time in the company of my father's advisors. You haven't finished your work. It's all water. Will we be able to breathe? Do you detect any lifeforms? Are you certain we have the correct planet? You may begin our descent. Can you repair it? Mister Tucker! What is that? This heat is unbearable. Where are we going? Your vessel will never find us here. You're bleeding. Remove your uniform. We have no idea what microbes live in this environment. Itcould become infected. You're my only hope of surviving here, Mister Tucker. I don'tintend to let you die. Hold still. The provisions won't last for more than a day. You're welcome. There's very little dry wood. I'm not your servant. You're the one who was raised in aprimitive environment. You find the wood. You're obviously better suited to physical labour. I should have you imprisoned for speaking to me that way. I'm beginning to think that would be preferable. How dare you! You insulted the First Monarch! What's wrong? Your vessel? Leave him. There's someone else here. Two hundred and forty six days. I doubt they would, but once I've been made First MonarchI'll have the authority to change the rules. Come visit me. Perhaps you'll find out. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Put them through to Shuttlepod One. Captain Archer of the Starship Enterprise. Something we can dofor you? What circumstances? Our top speed is warp five. How long until it hits? We can't fit eighty three people into Sickbay, and I'm notabout to draw lots. They are heavily shielded. Some kind of osmium alloy, if Iremember. Doctor? I don't see that we have any choice. We'll use the Catwalk, andset up a command station in one of the compartments. Maybe we should open a window. Sorry to keep you in there so long. Please. My Science Officer tells me you're from the Takret system. That's a long way from here. Really? Once we get out of the storm maybe you can help usupdate our star charts. Come in. I didn't expect it to be beautiful. Toobad we don't have time to run some scans. I'm a little nervous about shutting down the power grid. I did a little research in the Vulcan database. That Class fivestorm a century ago involved the Starship T'Plana. Apparently, theycouldn't outrun the wavefront. It was lost with all hands. I thoughtyou said it was nearly destroyed. Bridge to Commander Tucker. Ready for the handoff? See you in a few minutes. Archer out. Let's close up shop. Done a head count? Maybe later. Where's the comm.? Allhands, this is the Captain. This catwalk is going to be our home for awhile. A week, maybe more. You may not be comfortable, but you'll bealive. We have the best crew in the fleet and the sturdiest ship. Ipromise you, we'll get through this. Time? Polarise the hull plating. Travis? All hands, brace for impact. You wouldn't know who was the first Vulcan ambassador toEarth. Six letters, ends with an R? Solkar, I think. Don't mention it. How're you holding up? Your quarters will probably feel like a ballroom after this. I'll see what I can do. How're they doing? Let's give them a little time to adjust. There'll be other canyons. Feeling all right, Malcolm? Any problems with the crew? I could see about moving some ofthis to the aft section. I didn't realise space was at a premium on Denobula. Let me know if you change your mind. Travis? Wake me if there's a problem. When we're past those eddies, try and get some rest yourself. Ensign Tanner can relieve you. Good night. Go on. Go to sleep. Does this bother you? Only slightly. You know, there's a bright side to all of this. It's bringing the crew closer together. If you forget about thestorm outside, this is almost like going on a camping trip. Haven't you ever gone camping? Sounds fun. You haven't left the command area much today. Youmight want to wander around, get to know the crew. There's a lot more to these people than just their names. It'dbe good for you to fraternise a little. Does it have to be? Here's a chance to learn. Archer to Tucker. I need you in the command area right away. We may have a problem in Engineering. Not happy with your bunk mates? Don't forget they're the ones who warned us about the storm. Weowe them. Be patient. Two sensor glitches? Can you shut them down? It'd be best not to take the scenic route. Captain's Starlog, February 9, 2152. The Vulcans haveallowed the Mazarites to leave. Ambassador V'Lar says there's a 2152. We've responded to a distress call from a vessel inthe Who are they? What are they doing here? They just happened to find Enterprise in the middle of a classfive neutronic storm? Where three members of their own species justhappened to be taking refuge? I get the feeling they must be looking for you. Answer me! What do they want with you? You're deserters. You're assuming these three are telling the truth. They'vealready lied to us. Even if we could get the suits, we only have twenty two minutesin the radiation. Hard to believe we could re-take the ship in that How long do we have? How long? Forget it, Trip. You've already been exposed. Tell Travis to wait for my signal. I'll see you back at the catwalk. Don't belate. You're in my chair. They're dead, killed by the storm. Thanks for your condolences. Now, why don't youget the hell off my ship. I've been watching you, I know you're trying totake Enterprise. I'm not going to let you. I don't recognise your authority. I answer toStarfleet Command, and I'm under orders to use any means necessary tokeep my ship from falling into enemy hands. You're leaving me no choice. I'll destroyEnterprise. You would be surprised. It's time to change course,Travis. Head straight for that plasma eddy. Try and keep us in one piece. I'm on my way back. Archerout. Travis, I hope you're not still heading for that eddy. Ourfriends are gone. All hands, this is the Captain. Thanks to some finepiloting by Travis Mayweather, we're going to be moving out of thestorm a little earlier than expected. We should be clear in a fewminutes. Where're you headed next? Good luck."

A Vulcan starship encountered a class five over a centuryago. The vessel was nearly destroyed. Approximately four hours. You're proposing we take refuge in a crawlspace? You're behind schedule. Do you need help? That's correct. Perhaps some of your creatures could share. All right. Twenty cubic metres. We'll be inside the phenomenon for nearly eight days. We can runall the scans we want. Lieutenant Reed has completed his modifications. A single neutronic surge could overload the grid and damagecritical systems. I must have remembered incorrectly. One minute, fiveseconds. Thirty seconds. Twenty seconds. Fifteen. Ten. Only slightly. Am I disturbing you? Really. Perhaps we can sing a few songs later. In a manner of speaking. I once participated in the kahswanritual. I was taken to the desert and left to survive for ten days. I'm familiar with every one of them. Is that an order? I'm not skilled at fraternising. The antimatter injectors have come online. A power surge could've triggered both circuits. We're more than twenty light years from your homeworld. It's anunlikely coincidence. They obviously don't realise we're in the catwalk. If they learnwe're here, it would undoubtedly endanger the crew. We may outnumber them, but we only havethree EV suits. Understood. We're in position. Stand by. We're having trouble with the dilithiumsequencers. It's taking longer than we expected. We're disabling The final sequencer. Report. Maintain your course. They could still be on board. Maintain your course. That's an order. Goahead. Ensign. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We seem to havepassed through the worst part of the storm, but it'll still be a whilebefore we can leave the catwalk. The crew's in relatively good spirits,considering they haven't had a change of uniform in eight days. The dead man was secretly working for Sheriff Boggs. Isn't it obvious?

809,ENT,episode 36,TUCKER,"There's a gorge on the southern continentfive times deeper than the Grand Canyon. How about a little river rafting? T'Pol says it only gets darkfour days a month because of the binary suns. We'll have plenty ofdaylight left after we're done working every night. New planet, new aliens. Banner day. Nothing on sensors. What about theCatwalk? You know, the maintenance shaft running the length of eachnacelle. It'll be a tight squeeze, but there's no reason we can't fiteighty three people in there, and whatever supplies we need. At least twenty thousand particles per micron. There's just one other problem. It gets kind of toasty in therewhen the warp coils are online. About three hundred degrees. We'd haveto shut down the main reactor. Aye, Captain. You'll be in charge of the evacuation. Take us out oforbit, Travis. You think it's stuffy now, wait till we get eighty three peoplein here. You ever been through a storm as bad as this? Six weeks? Oh, I never thought about that. There are some storage lockersin the aft compartment. We ought to be able to convert a couple ofthem. This'll be our Bridge. We're going to have to jury-rig thesepanels, tap them into command functions. That storm must've been pretty scary. I'm afraid these aren't first class accommodations. We're going to have a lot of time to get to know each other. Ifyou need anything, I'll be right over here. Go ahead. Give me a second. Standing by, Captain. We're in the driver's seat. Entire crew's accounted for, including one quadruped. Would youlike to try out the Captain's chair? Try them again. Your guess is as good as mine. One of them came out a few hoursago. Told us we were making too much noise. Now, I've been realfriendly. Even asked them to join the game. Doesn't seem like they wantanything to do with us. You know, I bet by now we'd have set up camp on the rim of thatcanyon, had a fire going. Would you like a sauna while I'm at it? I only had four hours, Malcolm. You're lucky we've got atoilet. You want to take a shower? Build one yourself. Thanks, Chef. The Day the Earth Stood Still. Captain's orders. I set up a monitor in Compartment Five. Thescreen's a little small, but Are you aware you're sitting on top of a plasma manifold? Yougot to turn that thing off! That might've been a good idea. Go ahead. I'll be right there. I'll talk to Chef. Maybe he can heat that up for you. That can't be right. Probably just a glitch. Think you've gotroom for one more sleeping bag in here? I caught them throwing a barbecue next to a plasma manifold. Now, I understand we're explorers. We're supposed to keep an open mindabout different cultures, but these guys are driving me crazy. Theyonly need to sleep once a week, so they've kept us up the last twonights with their strange rituals. Chanting, walking in circles. They've practically taken over the compartment. I'm trying. Looks like the matter injectors and the antimatterinjectors are online. Do you have any idea what the odds are of that happening? Not from here. Someone's going to have to go to Engineering. Funny, you didn't mention that. What're you suggesting? We just sit on our hands until theyfire up the engines? I doubt you'd get very far. The launch bay's crawling withthem. It'll take a while for the warp coils to charge. Twenty minutes, tops. Remember, junction forty two alpha. Third panel, starboard side. And be careful. There's a lot ofcurrent running through those circuits. I really ought to be the onedoing this, Captain. The Doc said I was only out there for thirteenminutes. T'Pol? All right. First, you're going to have to disrupt theantimatter stream. Do you see the blue conduit to the left of the powertransfer module? Start by locking down the flow regulators. Go ahead. What's the problem shutting down thereactor? I don't mean to rush you But it's getting pretty warm in here. The temperature just went up another sixdegrees. Sub-Commander, how's it coming? Another one like that'll split us in two. Did that guy shoot one of his own men? How do you know that? Glad you could join us, Sub-Commander. We have movie nightevery Tuesday, if you're interested."

Sickbay is the most heavily shieldedsection. It's possible that some of the crew could survive there. Do you know the absorption depth of this alloy? It should be adequate. This way. I understand you've allotted fifteen cubic metres for medicalsupplies? That means there's only enough room for two-thirds of thesecages. They'll eat each other. They're vital to my work and the healthof this crew. I'm not accustomed to making emotional appeals. Please,don't ask me to choose between them. My Edosian slugs thank you. PalantiI, are you passing through or is there something I canhelp you with? Yes? This wouldn't have anything to do with gastrointestinaldistress? Not at all. There's a notation in your medical file. Somethingabout an unfortunate incident during zero g training. Nothing to be embarrassed about. I've treated a number ofcrewmen this afternoon for motion sickness. That should last for about twelve hours. Oh, a few bumps and bruises from the turbulence. Nothing tooserious. Nonsense. I have plenty of room. I find the close quartersrather comforting. Reminds me of home. Twelve billion people sharing one continent. Remember, the suit will protect you for only twenty two minutes. They're immune to radiolytic isotopes.

I'll never forget that look in my father'seyes. He knew we were in trouble. Spatial turbulence. Aft stabilisers aren't engaging. Grav-shear's dropping. That should be theworst of it, sir, at least for now. Yours? Looks like you're almost finished. We've got a cluster of plasma eddies about eighty thousandkilometres ahead. I should be able to steer clear of them. Aye, Captain. Thank you, sir. Good night. Broccoli? Call. Anyone know what they're showing tonight? I think something's burning. It'll take a minute, sir. We're too close to the eddy. We've got to veer off. We've got no choice."

Your vessel has been impounded under the authority ofthe Takret Militia. When we return, you'll be charged with criminalconspiracy. I have soldiers searching every deck. It's only a matter oftime before they find you. Earth's first warp five starship? Your father's engine? I'vebeen reading about you, Captain, and I doubt very much if you'll doanything to damage this vessel. Can you trace his signal? You have men there. Alert them. Where's he taking us? How long?

963,ENT,episode 36,RENTH,"We're stellar cartographers. We've had trouble digesting your food. They're officers of the Takret Militia. They've been pursuing usfor weeks. We thought we could evade them by hiding aboard your ship. We used to be members of the militia, in the lower ranks, butafter a year we realised that the commanding officers were corrupt. They seize alien vessels without provocation. They murder the crews,take anything of value. If they find us, we'll be executed."
964,ENT,episode 36,TAGRIM,"We're very relieved to see you. I'm Rellus Tagrim. This is my crew. Considering the circumstances, we would likepermission to come aboard as soon as possible. The neutronic wavefront. It's almost here. You should detect the storm in a few minutes. It'stravelling at high warp. Once we're aboard, I suggest you go to warpseven immediately. We understand. Our work often takes us far from home. We'd be pleased. They'll be fine, Commander. We're grateful for yourhospitality. Guri. I apologise, Commander. We should've spoken with you first. We were in danger. Our ship is less durable than yours. Wewould've been destroyed by the storm. Captain, I assure you. We don't know these men. Guri. We tried to resign our commissions but they wouldn't allow it. We had no choice. We would've told you the truth, but weweren't sure that you would help us. Captain, I apologise for the difficult position that we've putyou in, but I know these men. Even if they found us, I doubt they'dsimply leave. They've captured vessels far less impressive than yours. We're not lying. These men are dangerous. I apologise for the trouble we've caused. The Gyrannan System. We should be safe there."
965,ENT,episode 36,PALANTI,We've searched every deck. There's no sign of the fugitives. It appears they have deserted the ship. I'm having difficulty with the dilithium matrix. Palanti to Captain. The dilithium matrix is active. We're ready to initialise the warpreactor. Acknowledged. We're being hailed. No. It's coming from within this vessel. He's somewhere on the fifth deck. It'll take me much longer than that. We should evacuate. You heard what he said. He's willing to destroy his own ship. Spatial disturbance. We're four minutes from the eddy. Unless you've found a way to turn this ship around I stronglysuggest we abort the mission.

Trip's a good pilot. If he was near one of those moons he mostlikely set down on it. How many are there? Then we'd better start looking. Travis. We'll scan every moon, even if we have to do it withbinoculars. Keep hailing him. Who are they? You've dealt with them? And you are? I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. Weweren't aware that this system was claimed by anyone. Sub-Commander T-Pol is my Science Officer. A member of my crew is missing. We believe he exchanged weaponsfire with a small vessel. Was it one of yours? Then maybe we can look for them together. Once we've recoveredour crewman we'll be more than happy to leave. Either way, we're not going anywhere until we know whathappened. Now it seems to me we have a similar problem. Two missingpeople and sixty two moons. It'll go a lot faster if we use both ourships to co-ordinate the search. The sooner we get started, the soonerwe'll be out of your territory. Any progress? And the Arkonians? This is their territory. They could have called for more shipsto help search. What's the bad blood? Well, maybe we'll have better luck with them. They agreed to work with us. What have you got? I'll need a little help here. Go on. Doesn't sound so bad. We'd better hope that Trip landed on the night side. Trip? It was transmitted on a Starfleet frequency. That's why I asked you here. The message was in a Starfleetfrequency, but we think the carrier wave was generated by yourtechnology. We weren't able to respond. If we can't isolate the wave wewon't be able to rescue either of them. My science officer believes shecan recalibrate your scanners to isolate our frequencies. Then you canpinpoint their location. Then send your science officer over here. T'Pol can show himwhat to do. It seems my engineer and your pilot have found a way towork together. We read you, Trip. We're getting a lock on your position now. it's selenium isotopes, but we don't think it willinterfere with the transporter. We know. The Arkonians helped us find you. How are you andtheir pilot getting along? Stand by, Trip. Prepare thetransporter. What's the problem? Meaning? Archer to Commander Tucker. Trip, we can bring you aboard but we can't transport theArkonian. Doctor Phlox says it will kill him. We'll try to find a wayto get him back to his ship. But in the meantime, I'm getting you outof there. Let's get you home. Then we'll worry about your friend. How? We'll talk to them, but I won't let youstay down there much longer. Archer out. Come in. I justgot a report from my doctor. Your pilot's responding well. He'll beready to go home in a few hours. He's tired and a bit sunburned, but he's doing fine. It was a misunderstanding. I hope we can avoid them in thefuture. I guess we won't be adding the Arkonians to our list offriends. Let's hope it stays that way."

No, but I'm aware of their reputation. If we're in theirterritory, we should proceed with extreme caution. We've searched five of the moons. No sign of Commander Tucker orthe Arkonian ship. It appears they've made no progress either. They're continuingto search the moons they agreed to. I'm afraid they don't trust us. Primarily because I'm a Vulcan. We made First Contact nearly a hundred years ago, not long afterthe Arkonians developed warp drive. But from the beginning, ourrelations were difficult. Your people accepted Vulcan guidance, openeddiplomatic and cultural exchanges. The Arkonians were suspicious anddeceitful. Eventually, the High Command withdrew its contingent. It doesn't appear promising. For now. I'd advise you to remain cautious. Arkonians areunpredictable. They're prone to hostility. I'll keep that in mind. Let me know when we reach the next moon. See for yourself. It's a thermo-kinetic analysis of e moons. Each of themundergoes extreme temperature variations during their orbits. At night, it can drop to five or even ten degrees below zero. During the day, the temperature can rise to as high as onehundred and seventy degrees. And that we find him before the sun rises. The surface temperature is rising quickly, Commander. I estimateit will reach one hundred thirty degrees within the next hour. The encounter was less volatile than I expected. You managed toestablish better relations in a single day than the Vulcans have in acentury."

It's like a gravitational jigsaw puzzle. Watch out, Travis. These modifications are working so well, pretty soon we won't needpilots anymore. Captain? Say again, Captain. I'm picking up a lot of interference. There's a small vessel approaching your position. This is Commander Charles Tucker. Tucker toEnterprise. Mayday. I'm losing power. Mayday!

Iwant you to see this. Here. Come here. It's like talking to Porthos. See this? I tried bypassing the induction coil, but it didn't work. See? In here. I can't fix this. I need to get back to my ship. My ship. Now, pick 'em up. Pick them up! Same to you. Now, let's get going. Don't give me that look. You started this. You want some food? Food. Nohkto. I couldn't agree more. You want food from your ship? V'dhoze, that means food? V'dhoze, ship. Yeah. Sorry, but breakfast is going to have to wait. I'vefigured out a way to get us out of here. I got a pretty good look atyour comm. configuration back there. I think I can cannibalise thepower supply from your transceiver and use it to get mine working. Maybe get a message off. Got it. Almost there. I think this is going to work. No, not nohkto. Good. That's right. We're getting out of here. Once we get back toEnterprise and we can finally understand each other, the first wordsout of your mouth had better be thank you. You thinkthat's funny? You going to laugh now? Tucker to Enterprise. Enterprise, do you read me? Come on, Hoshi. Tucker to Enterprise. Thisterrain, it's all volcanic. Igneous rock is heavy in diamagneticminerals. It's interfering with the transmission. I think I know whatwe need to do. The transceiver, the tsunsana. It's bad down here. Nohkto. But if we take it to higher ground we could avoid some of theinterference. I'm going to need help. You and me, together. See? I'm not going to hurt you, and you are notgoing to hurt me. We'll work together. Before we start, we'll get some food fromyour ship. Your v'dhoze. Easy. Is that the best you can do? We can fight some more if you want, or we can try to getthe hell out of here. What's it going to be? Comeon. Respond. Mayday. Enterprise. Anybody. Please respond. Chief Engineer's log, supplemental. It's been two hours sincewe started signaling the Enterprise. No response yet. The sun's noteven up yet and it's already hotter than hell. My sparring partnerdoesn't look too good. I can't be sure, but I don't think his speciescan sweat. For the record, I have learned one thing about him. Hisname's Zho'Kaan. Anything you want to say to the folks back home? That means bad. You'd be proud of me, Hoshi. I've picked upabout a dozen words in his language. A couple of them are realtongue-twisters. Hey. Zho'Kaan. I though I lost youthere. No. No Enterprise. Don't worry. I'll get Phlox to cook up a new batch for you oncewe're aboard Enterprise. He's great with that kind of thing. Stay withme, Zho'Kaan. Gan tak. Don't die on me now, understand? All right. See? I told you. Hoshi, is that you? Do you read me? You're just in time, Captain. It's starting to get alittle hot down here. Don't send a shuttlepod. There's something in this atmospherethat'll affect the engines. I'm not alone, Captain. Uh, just like old friends. I'm a little worried, though. He'sgotten very dehydrated. I'm still here, Captain. No way, Captain. I'm not leaving him here. I'm sorry, sir, but I can't do that. Maybe there's another way. We know our pods can't make it, but I gota good look at the circuitry inside the Arkonian shuttle. One of theirscould be modified. If they take a look at their intake manifolds I think they could realign them to filterout the isotopes. Understood. Tucker to Enterprise. Enterprise, respond. Some of these relayshave fused. Must be the heat. Hey. Gan tak. I don't suppose theCaptain'll trust me to go out on my own for a while. I wouldn't besurprised if he knocked me down to steward. Your orange juice, sir. Jamor marmalade, sir? But I tell you I wouldn't trade my time onEnterprise. Not for anything. I've seen things I could never imagineback home. I saw the Great Plume of Agosoria and I saw the ringed moonsof Matalas Prime. And I stood on an asteroid crater twice as high asEverest, and went diving in the ice caves of Etheenia. Rode in aSuliban cell ship. Spent the night, I spent the night with a princess. Oh, and I even got pregnant once. Now there's a story. I'm sure youhave stories, too. That's why we chose this life, right? See thingswe've never seen before. Hell of a ride, though. Hell of a ride. Zho'Kaan. V'dhoze. How's he doing? They told me another ten minutes of sunshine, and we'd havebeen cooked. I thought you said the UT was working. You mean the brown stuff you were drinking? Won't take aminute. Anything else while I'm at it? Our chef is making somethingcalled chicken Marsala tonight. Tarattaash. Got you. That makes two of us. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Well in that case, why don't we have some lunch while themicroscope's being unloaded? Have you spoken to Phlox since he got back? You must've not seen him yesterday morning. He was champing atthe bit to get down to that conference. Brought back a wish list ofmedical instruments. He said there was a Vulcan contingent. You might want to godown for a visit. You may know one of them. I would think you'd enjoy spending time with members of yourown species. Archer. Speak of the devil. Looks like you won't have to go anywhere. I'll meet them at Docking port two. Let him know, okay? You have any idea what this is about? You can bet they're not coming up for coffee and doughnuts. Can I get you something? Thanks to Sub-Commander T'Pol, ourchef has learned to make some pretty decent Plomeek soup. Absolutely. If you need anything, just let me know. Sub-Commander. Archer to Doctor Phlox. Could you report to my ready room? Come in. I wanted to see both of you. It's been a while since I wasembarrassed by a Vulcan dignitary. I just spoke to Doctor Oratt. It seems you requested somemedical data regarding a Vulcan illness for a colleague on Denobula. And both of you said that T'Pol had nothing to do with thatrequest. Are you both going to lie to me like you lied to them? And when were you going to tell me that you've contracted aserious illness? They handed you something. A PADD, I think. Does that ring abell? You left a fingerprint. It was enough for them to run tests. Whydid you lie to them? It sure as hell is if they can help you. How longhave you known about this? And you never thought that maybe you should come to me and letme know that one of my officers has a potentially fatal disease? You still haven't explained to me why you lied to the Vulcans. And why would you think they would be more apt to help you if you saidit was for a Denobulan colleague? For having a disease? Go on. Intimate? That ship of Vulcans who were experimenting with emotions. You belong to that minority? Then? Why would you take that risk? You were attacked. I remember. I'm sure the High Command willunderstand. Why not? How serious is it? Well, your request was accompanied by a lie, and whatever yourreasons might have been, you're no longer welcome at the conference. The Vulcans have seen to that. My number one priority here is the health of my first officer. If these doctors have data that can help her, I plan to get it. Actually, you did. Sub-Commander T'Pol and my doctor have explained the situationto me. Doctor Phlox assures me that he was only trying to protect herprivacy. He doesn't make a habit of lying. I'm having a little difficulty understanding why you won'tshare your research, especially now that you know it could help T'Pol'scondition. I can't believe you're withholding it to punish Doctor Phlox. Then what does it have to do with? And because you find them undesirable they're not entitled tomedical care? Intimate acts? You're talking about mind-melds. If you're not going to help her the least you could do is showa little discretion. The High Command doesn't need to know about this. You have her genetic profile. You must realise she's not amember of this minority. Come in. I was just aboutto call you. Sit down. I'm sorry. I didn't have much luck down there. They seemed pretty pig-headed when it comes to Pa'nar syndrome, and Igot the distinct feeling they're not going to keep this to themselves. Which one was he? Help? That seems like the last thing these doctors want to do. You know, it never dawned on me that it wascontagious. You said it wasn't contagious, that there was nothing I couldhave done. That doesn't mean you shouldn't have told me. You're damn straight I do. Every last one of them. You findthat strange? I guess all Vulcans find worrying strange. How useful is it? Have you figured out why Doctor Yuris gave it to you? A few minutes ago. They've decided to recall you. Doctor Oratt does. He's a ranking member of the Council ofPhysicians. They plan on taking you back to Vulcan when the conferenceis over. Not till you reach Vulcan. You've got to tell them, T'Pol. Tellthem what happened. They won't do a thing to you once they know itwasn't voluntary, that he did it against your will. Why the hell not? It makes a lot of difference. You're not a member of thisminority. He forced himself on you. You said it yourself. Where's Oratt? Perhaps you can't. I need to talk to you! You have no right to take my Science Officer. You can't dismiss someone just because you don't agree with theway they conduct their personal lives. Fit? You're saying a single mind-meld is enough to destroy hercareer? Or is it that she contracted the disease? That's why you're sohesitant to find a cure, isn't it? Why bother to help people you don'tapprove of? Not so fast. You know what this is, Doctor? My CommunicationsOfficer got it from the Vulcan database. It's the protocols of theCouncil of Physicians. It says that anyone accused of ethicalmisconduct is entitled to a hearing before the ranking medical officerin the province or territory where the accusation was first made. IfI'm not mistaken, that would be you. Where I come from, everything's open for debate. And if I readthese protocols correctly, so is the accusation you made against myScience Officer. It's mine to waste. Tomorrow afternoon. Fine. I spoke to Doctor Oratt. I didn't tell you because I didn'twant you to try and talk me out of it. Not exactly. Before I left, I got the medical protocols fromHoshi. It seems they owe you a hearing. They already did. If you're not going to defend yourself, the least you can do isspeak for this minority you're so eager to protect. You said you didn'twant to condone the attitude of these doctors. Your silence would dojust that. I'll go along with that. I promise. But you've got tounderstand, I'm not going to give you up without a fight. No. It has to do with how she got infected. A mind meld over ayear ago. So what you're saying is that if a Vulcan, even an officer inthe Science Directorate, engages in this exchange of thoughts andmemories, they're condemned for it? You humans are too volatile, too irrational, too narrow-minded. That's what I heard for years, from every Vulcan I met. But we don'thold a candle to you when it comes to narrow-minded. We got rid ofbigotry nearly a century ago. We're not afraid of diversity. We don'tpersecute it, we embrace it. If you call yourselves enlightened, youhave to accept people who are different than you are. Seems my Science Officer doesn't want to discuss it. That'sgood enough for me. Come in. Doctor Yuris hasbeen suspended. They offered him a hearing, but he refused. Oratt said he'lllose his standing with the Medical Exchange when they get back toVulcan. One good thing did come out of this. They believed him when hesaid you were forced. You're not going to be recalled. Permission granted. I know you must be very disappointed thathe broke his promise to you, but on a selfish note, I'm glad he did. Ididn't want to lose you. Let's hope so. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

1152,ENT,episode 38,T'POL,"The treatment's no longer effective? It's too great a risk. I'd be taken off Enterprise. It's too great a risk. I wasn't aware he was gone. It is the first I. M. E. conference he's attended in over a year. There are over one million physicians on Vulcan. I haven't spoken to anyone on the surface. Of course. You are physicians. Why would you need me to define an illness? It's an incurable degradation of the synaptic pathways. It alsoaffects the endocrine and immune systems. Through a telepathic practice. Mind-melds. They cause a disruption of neuroelectric impulses inthe mid-brain, which can lead to the early stages of the syndrome. I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me why you asked me here. They're Vulcan. I'm not familiar with any of them. Not well, but I've met a number of them. I don't understand what your questions have to do with theDoctor's request. You travelled up from the surface to tell Doctor Phlox youwouldn't help him? Sir? It's none of their concern. The disease is not contagious. If we had told you there'snothing you could have done. If the High Command was to learn that I was infected, I wouldmost likely lose my commission. It's not about the disease. It's about the people who arecapable of transmitting it. There are certain Vulcans, a small minority, who are born withthe ability to perform a very intimate form of telepathy. A melding of minds. They are part of the telepathic minority. One of the reasons whythey left Vulcan was to escape prejudice. Their behaviour is consideredunnatural. They're seen as a threat. No. It wasn't by choice. One of the men on that ship. I have no intention of telling them. I have my reasons. Yes. Transfer it here. I just received a message from Doctor Yuris. The youngest. He asked me to meet him in a northern section ofthe city. I believe he wants to help. He asked me to come alone. I beg your pardon? That's correct. There's a landing port about a kilometre south of the meetingplace. You worry about your crew. I didn't want you to worry about me. What is it? You've taken a great risk by bringing this to me. Why? Why jeopardise your career to help someone you despise? You know I'm not a member of the minority. What if I didn't choose? Are you infected? You can't jeopardise your position. Thank you for this. As we've seen, they're not very motivated to develop a cure. No, I haven't. You spoke with them. Have they notified the High Command? I won't do that. I have Pa'nar Syndrome. It doesn't make a difference how Icontracted it. He is not right. If I use that as a defence as a way to keepfrom being taken off Enterprise, I'd be condoning their prejudice, andin the process, indicting every member of the minority. I won't dothat. Come in. Lieutenant Reed told meyou went to the surface. I assume you were unsuccessful. They'll never agree. I have no interest in challenging their decision. You need to understand. I won't tell them how I got the disease. They haven't elected to do anything. They're born with thisability. There are no rules telling you to oppress minorities. No, I'm being recalled because you're afraid of anything thatdoesn't conform to your idea of acceptable behaviour. You gave me your word. Why? So you can perpetuate your double standard? Condemn theinfected when they meld by choice and sympathise with them when theydon't? I have nothing to say to them. That was to be expected. Also to be expected. With your permission, I'll be contacting the High Command. Idon't intend to let Yuris be dismissed without a fight. Maybe this incident will encourage others to speak out."
1153,ENT,episode 38,TUCKER,"What's the point of having three wives if you never get to seethem? Ma'am. I'd love to, but I think I should make sure your equipment getsup to Sickbay in one piece. You bet. If the reflectometer is supposed toamplify the neutron stream, shouldn't it be installed before theemitters? Oh, I've tried to read the instructions, and they are anythingbut clear. I don't want to brag, but I can take apart and put backtogether just about any piece of equipment I've ever met. It's one ofthe reasons Captain Archer picked me for this mission, because I'mreally good at following instructions. But these are in Here. Which one? You're going to have to help mewith this one. I think I'm getting the hang of it. Maybe if you explain thenext few steps, I could try and get through some of this on my own. I try to be. Amazing. Look at that. Are those? First I reinitialise the neutron stream. This is a bitch. Oh, not you. The microscope. Did I do this right? Why is there no image? There you go. Why isn't it sharp? Why not? Are you kidding? They're showing The Black Cat. Boris Karloffand Bela Lugosi. Me? What's the rush? You haven't even finished your dinner. You've got plenty of time. Try the cobbler. Chef outdid himself. I'm getting a little paranoid here. You're not talking aboutme, are you? It's okay, Hoshi. No, not exactly. Look, I'm very flattered, but aren't you amarried woman? I'm afraid I've got to go, too. Captain asked me to write asynopsis of tonight's movie. You probably wouldn't like it. It's very scary, and you've gotto. You've got to be human to appreciate horror films. I'll see you inthe morning. She's at it again. Come on, Malcolm, this is serious. What if Phlox finds out? Of course not. Maybe I should tell the Doc. I've got to spend the next two days with her working on themicroscope. I really think I should speak to Phlox. No, I'm fine. I just, er, I need to talk to you for a minute. Actually, I was kind of hoping to talk to you alone. See you, Travis. Malcolm said this was a bad idea, but I, Ithink it's the right thing to do. Feezal, I mean, Mrs. Phlox, is a lovely woman, and she's verysmart. She knows more about quantum optics than anyone I've ever met. Remarkable, yeah, she sure is. Yeah, there is. You got to understand, I've been a perfectgentleman. Absolutely nothing's happened. She's trying to. She's,she's, er, making advances, if you know what I mean? I'm afraid so. No, no, no. Nothing like that. Sure. I mean, no, she's your wife. She's your wife? Why, of course it is. But I was brought up believing you don'tplay around with another man's wife. I don't think I'm ever going tochange my mind about that. I think I've got it figured out. Just let me know when itstarts acting up. Have you got the activation sequence down? Well, I've got to get back to my warp engine. The plasma'srunning a little hot. Pleasure meeting you."

This conference is a perfect opportunity. Some of your finest physicians will be there. It's essential that Ispeak with them. I think I can question them without revealing that you'reinfected. I'm afraid we have no choice. Without further treatment, youcould very possibly die. Captain's Starlog Supplemental Oh, I haven't seen Feezal for nearly four years. Denobulans are renowned for their patience. Welcome, my beloved! Captain Archer, I'd like you to meet my second wife, Feezal. And this is our Chief Engineer, Commander Tucker. Nonsense, Captain. We've been apart for four years. Anotherhour, another day. As I said, we're very patient. One of my colleagues on Denobula has been studying Pa'narSyndrome for some time. Its pathology is quite similar to thymicsclerosis. It's a nonfatal illness which we've had very little successtreating. I promised him, my colleague back home, that I'd inquire aboutany recent advances in its treatment. My friend is well aware of that. Unfortunately, thymic sclerosisis found in all strata of Denobulan society. Developing a cure is ofparamount importance. As I told you, I'm currently serving on a Starfleet vessel. Humans are not susceptible to it. I could contact my colleague but itwould take at least five days before we'd receive a response. Anything you could provide me with would be instrumental inhelping the Denobulan people. Thank you for your time. Sub-Commander T'Pol is not aware of my request. I'm curious whyyou asked her to stay. That's correct. As far as I know, her expertise does not includemedicine. As would I. Your questions to T'Pol seem inappropriate. I believe I was very clear about that. What motive are you suggesting? Are you saying there is no additional research? Has Vesna forgiven Groznik yet? Well, at least he has his other wives. Which one was her third husband? Oh, was that Klaban? Forlisa. Forlisa. Oh, my, my. I thought aboutasking Forlisa to be my second wife. Turned out she already had threehusbands. Yes, Captain. Certainly. I'll be back as soon as I can, my beloved. Commander. Yes, Captain. Sir? Yes, sir. I have no intention of lying to you, Captain. Nearly a year. I believe your culture embraces the concept of doctor-patientconfidentiality. Pa'nar syndrome is an illness that carries a stigma on Vulcan. Only members of the minority can initiate a mind-meld, but anyVulcan can be the recipient. I've kept it in check, but the symptoms have progressed. That'swhy I requested the most current research. I understand. This is far from acure, but it should slow down the progression of the disease. It'ssurprising. I assumed your Science Directorate would've made moreprogress than this. With this research, I should be able to get closer than theyhave. Very. It will allow me to improve my course of treatment longbefore her symptoms get worse. Do they have the authority to do that? He's right, T'Pol. You should tell them. Just because they asked you to participate, doesn't mean you hadto. You're lucky this creature didn't strike a bit lower. If I mayask, what is the purpose of this sport? I don't believe so. Are you not feeling well, Commander? By all means. What's on your mind? I think we're about done here. It would be best if you avoidedfargans for a few days. What's that? She is remarkable. Was there something else? Sexual advances? Has she offered to give you a rose petal bath? Oh, any man would be a fool to ignore the romantic overtures ofa healthy Denobulan woman. Don't you find her attractive? What does that have to do with it? Oh, nonsense. Nonsense. You're too concerned with humanmorality. I thought you wanted to learn about new cultures. Isn't thatwhy you joined Starfleet? As you wish. Your loss. Feezal tells me it can be quite temperamental. My beloved. I certainly hope it's not anotherfour years until I see you again. Commander Tucker assures me he'll keep your beautiful microscopein perfect running order. It's a shame you two didn't get to know each other better. Humans."

Do you condone these acts, Sub-Commander? These mind-melds? Yes, your colleague on Denobula. Forgive us Doctor, but sincethere's a Vulcan serving on your ship, a fact that you neglected tomention to us, we had to consider other possible motives for youinquiry. Are you familiar with any of thesenames? They're melders. Vulcans with the ability to transfer thoughtsand memories to each other. Do you know any melders, Sub-Commander? Then I'll ask you again. Do you condone their behaviour? Unmistakably. She's suffering from the syndrome. I'm sorry, did we keep you waiting? What can we do for you, Captain? It's unfortunate that T'Pol is ill. I certainly hope not. Our decision has nothing to do with that. Pa'nar syndrome is a disease that's unique to an undesirablesegment of our population. Thankfully, there are very few of them. We don't condone the intimate acts that these people engage in. They defy everything our society stands for. We take great pride in our ability to contain emotions. Sharingthem is offensive. Now if you'll excuse me, we have a great deal ofwork to do before the conference ends. It's not for us to decide what the High Command needs to know. Nonetheless, there's only one way to contract Pa'nar syndrome. Good day. The fact that she has Pa'nar Syndrome is not the reason she'sbeing recalled. When it took place is not pertinent. Exactly. They're genetic aberrations who prey on people likeyou. People foolish enough to experiment with abhorrent behaviour. This is pointless. Our culture is governed by rules. We're notabout to ignore them. You'd rather let them spread their infections. That's exactlywhy you're being recalled. Unfortunately, you don't know what you're talking about. Thedecision's been made. We should end this inquiry. We?"
1313,ENT,episode 38,FEEZAL,"My beloved. Thank you. I look forward to helping you install the microscope. I'd be honoured. Won't you be joining us,Commander? Then I'll see you after lunch? It's collimating the neutrons, not amplifying them. If you readthe instructions, you'll find it's all very clear. Denobulan. I understand. That's why I'm here. So let's gothrough it slowly. Do you see the threads on the aperture ring? Exactly. Take the smaller condenser lens and screw it on. Nowremodulate the emitter frequency. That'll initiate the neutron stream. It's very simple. Insert the thick end into this opening. It'llautomatically programme the frequency. You can pull it out now. Thestream should be initiated. By all means. You're a very confident young man, aren't you? You're going to need to come a little closer to see this. Now watch. A simple strand of protein molecules can be enlargedand enhanced to where we can clearly see a single nucleotide. Carbon atoms. Now you try it. Precisely. Very good. Now align the quantum filters. Excuse me? Absolutely not. Groznik has only apologised twice. I doubthe'll be forgiven for another two years. Not wives, wife. Kessil moved to Teerza Prime to be with herthird husband. You forgot to enter the frequency parameters. Bogga. Klaban was Forlisa's husband. Her first, I think. You forgot to stabilise the aperture. That's just a reflectionof the imaging filament. That's all right. We'll reinitialise the neutron stream and start again. May I join you? Feezal Phlox. You're the language wizard. My husband speaksvery fondly of you. I'm impressed. Ensign Sato barely has anaccent. She was telling me how attractive she thinks you are. I wasn't exactly pulling your leg, was I? I'm a woman. That's all that matters, isn't it? Save me a seat. So do I. But remember, your other wives are anxious to see youtoo. As his doctor, I hope you'll keep Commander Tucker in perfectrunning order. Perhaps that'll motivate me to visit more often. I know how it feels."
1314,ENT,episode 38,ORATT,"We're hesitant to discuss Pa'nar Syndrome, Doctor. This illnessis unique to a subculture, a small percentage of our population. Theirbehaviour is neither tolerated nor sanctioned. We'll have to discuss your request, Doctor. When we've reached adecision, we'll contact you aboard your ship. We appreciate your hospitality, Captain, but we've come to speakto your doctor, with your permission. We would appreciate it if T'Pol would remain. We've discussed your request. Unfortunately, we are stillhesitant to share data regarding Pa'nar Syndrome. Are you familiar with Pa'nar Syndrome, Sub-Commander? Would you mind describing it? Please, indulge us. And what practice would that be? Doctor Phlox has asked for data regarding the treatment ofPa'nar Syndrome. Did you have anything to do with that request? We find their behaviour unacceptable, and since Pa'nar Syndromeis transmitted by these people, its cure is not a priority. None that we'd care to disseminate. I'm sorry. If you'll please show us to the airlock. What can I do for you, Captain? You're mistaken. I have every right. I am not dismissing T'Pol. I'm simply returning her to Vulcan. The High Command will decide whether she is fit for duty. I'm sorry you don't understand the complexities of our culture,Captain. Please have the Sub-Commander ready to depart in thirty sixhours. The accusation against T'Pol stands. It's not open for debate. You're wasting your time. Very well. But I will not delay our departure. The hearing willtake place tomorrow afternoon. As you've been told, Captain, mind melds are practiced by asubculture. Vulcans who have elected to conduct themselves in anunacceptable manner. Are you questioning our judgement? You realise that you are jeopardising your reputation, yourcareer? The High Command will determine whether you should be punished. Both of you. Can you verify this? What do you know of this, Captain?"
1315,ENT,episode 38,YURIS,"It seems odd, doesn't it, that a Denobulanphysician would be interested in a Vulcan disease. Do you have any literature on this disease? You're requesting information about a Vulcan disease, and youdidn't discuss it with your Vulcan Science Officer? Is it definitive? Sub-Commander. This may be of use to you. The research your doctor asked for. One that I'm more than willing to take. There's more intolerance today than there was a thousand yearsago. It has to stop. If I despised you, I'd be despising myself. I'm part of theminority. As far as my colleagues are concerned, you might as well be. Anyone who chooses to perform a mind-meld is worthy of contempt. You were coerced. You should tell them. They'll be far moresympathetic. No. Only a small percentage are. If they ask my opinion, I won'tbe able to condone what you did. I hope you understand. I have to return. Tell them what happened. Tell them before theycontact the High Command. She knows exactly what she's talking about. There is nothing abhorrent about the way we lead our lives. There is no simple definition of intimacy. Those of us capableof mind-melds are no different than you are. We share our thoughts differently. We shouldn't be punished forthat. She's not guilty of anything. She was violated. The mind-meld was performed against her will. She told me herself. She made me promise to stay silent. I'msorry. I had to tell them the truth. You should do the same."

We'll get there as fast as we can. I think we'll make it in one piece, Trip. I've been readingabout Paan Mokar in the Vulcan database. It doesn't say a lot. Class D,not much bigger than Earth's moon, claimed by the Vulcans in 2097. If it was unclaimed at the time, why would there be a problem? They were setting up a military base? What happened to the Andorian colonists? Until now. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. In the three daysit's taken us to reach Paan Mokar, the situation has grown considerablymore tense. Welcome aboard, Ambassador. T'Pol has been filling me in on the situation here, but I stillhave a lot of questions. I don't understand. I was told you asked for me. If that's how you feel, we'll gladly continue with our mission. Shran. You're asking for my help? I'll see what I can do. Obviously, I'm here at the request of the Andorians. Shranbelieves he can trust me. I don't intend to prove him wrong by goingdown there with a Vulcan officer in tow. If you insist I bring a Vulcanalong, I'll take the one I know I can trust. You wanted to see me, Doc? Bombard. What about T'Pol? Warm and friendly as ever. It's crucial to ours, too. Maybe we're not out here to justscan comets and meet new species. Maybe we're out here to prove thathumanity is ready to join a much larger community. I intend to do that,whether the Vulcans like it or not. We've lost the navigational sensors, and the comm. Let's hope they're accurate. I glanced at it. It's twelve hundred pages long. I got all of it. V'Lar's treatise, the Revised IntersystemAgreement, the High Command briefing on the Border Incursions of 2112. I was up till two a. m. Are you trying to tell me something? That maybe I'm notprepared for this? Thanks, but I doubt I'm going to impress Shran by quotingVulcan treaties. The first thing is to convince Shran that he can trust me. We're just going to have to play it by ear. Are you sure these are the coordinates? We're not armed. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer. I'm here to see Commander Shran. I wasn't told to come alone. This is my Science Officer. Shehelped expose the Vulcan listening post at P'Jem. I thought Shran mightenjoy seeing her again. I imagined my first diplomatic mission would involve sittingaround a big table, toasting with champagne, signing things with lotsof pens. They say the same thing about you. Prove them wrong. I hope I can help again, but the first thing I need is to seethe hostages. The Vulcans want to know they're all right. Are you all right? You don't expect them to agree to all that. For the record, the Vulcan High Command doesn't like me verymuch, and, frankly, the feeling is mutual. If all you need is someoneto deliver your list of demands, find somebody else. I've got otherthings to do. I'll see what I can do. That might be a little difficult. But not impossible. The thing is, he's going to want somethingin return. I'm talking about a gesture, something to show you're serious. I came down here to see about the hostages. Why don't you let them go? Release two of them, then. Keep the other one until afteryou've met with Soval. You're being awfullyquiet. You don't seem too happy with the way I handled things downthere. Thank you. You got one of your men back. They want to talk to you, not kidnap you. And if you don't, these negotiations end before they begin. Both sides are responsible for what happens here. With all due respect, Ambassador, why did you agree to let mego down there if you won't listen to my advice? You claim the Andorians are inflexible. At least they'rewilling to sit down and talk. The ball's in your court now. They're expecting us. We'll be fine. I plan on being back long before then. I'll try to speed things up this time. They'll send some soldiers tomeet us. I'm afraid they'll want to blindfold you. It's just a securityprecaution. Of course. T'Pol? Archer to Enterprise. For once we're in full agreement. If you don't mind, Ambassador. I'm going to bring us in on thrusters. The ground is going to do that for us. Brace yourselves. Any idea where we are? I appreciate your help, Ambassador but we're looking for theAndorians. I gave my word to Shran. I intend to keep it. We don't know that. Sensors and communications are offline. There's weapons fireflying all over the place. We don't know what happened. This is a man who couldn't sleep because he thought he owed mesomething. I don't believe he asked me to come a dozen light years justso I could lead you into a trap. And right now it seems like the bestthing to do is to get a cease-fire in place. The Andorians won't agreeto that until they talk to you in person. I managed to keep us oncourse most of the way in. We can't be more than a kilometre fromShran's landing coordinates. You've been here before. I don't suppose you'd care to help? I thought Vulcans had exceptional memories. If we keep moving this way, we should be Down! They're not shooting at us. I don't recommend sticking your neck out right now. I'll take a look. Stay here. That's an order. No offence, but my ears are less likely todraw fire than yours. No. They're pulling back. Let's keep moving. Get down! Go. Over there. Hold your fire! How is he? We've brought the Vulcan ambassador to meet with CommanderShran! It looks like two of them. One on top ofthat structure And the other on theground. If I can work my way around I might be ableto come up from behind them. Make sure they don't see me. You don't have to hit anything, just keep them occupied. Reallyoccupied or I'm not going to get very far. Hey. Drop your weapon. I've never fired one of these before. I'm not sure if it's set on stun. T'Pol, cease fire! You fired on my shuttle. You're trying to kill Soval, undermineeverything that Shran is trying to do here. Why? Do you want a war withthe Vulcans? You can take that up with him. Let's go. Are you all right? I suppose I shot the Ambassador to make mystory more convincing. She's not the only one who risked their life. I said I'd bringSoval to meet you and we damn near got killed getting him here. I camebecause you asked me. Because you thought I could be trusted. CheckSoval's wound. Check our shuttle. You'll find Andorian weaponssignatures. Nice to hear your voice, Trip. T'Pol and I are fine. We're at the Andorian command post. Ambassador Soval's been injured, but Shran's medics are treating him. He's just being a good host. The Andorians are allowingthe Vulcan ships to move in and pick up their people. Did you run into any problems up there? We had a pretty rough landing. We'll need a ride back tothe ship. Acknowledged. Archer out. I believe someone once defined a compromise as a solution thatneither side is happy with. Of course. I wouldn't go that far. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

1326,ENT,episode 39,REED,"And our officers? I think the Vulcans see them, too. They're breaking orbit. Probably giving themselves room to manoeuvre. The Vulcans are charging weapons. The Andorians as well. If you don't mind me asking, what do you have in mind? Locked and ready. The Vulcan ships are breaking formation. They're heading for the planet."

1328,ENT,episode 39,SOVAL,"Thank you, Captain. This is Sub-commander Muroc. If you don't mind, Captain, I have a question of myown. Why would an officer of the Andorian Imperial Guard personallyrequest your involvement? I'm involved in extremely difficult and dangerous negotiations. I don't consider your presence here an asset. Six days ago, an Andorian regimental commander named Shranlanded a force on Paan Mokar and occupied the settlement. Naturally, we attempted to enforce the Treaty of 2097. Shran has agreed to discuss terms for their safe return, butonly if you act as mediator. For some reason, he finds you trustworthy. Yes, Captain, I'm asking for your help. Forgive my candor, but that's hardly reassuring. The last timeyou dealt with the Andorians, a Vulcan intelligence site wascompromised and a priceless monastery destroyed. Sub-commander Murocwill accompany you to represent our interests. Unacceptable. And in exchange, you'll deliver me into their hands? I'm surethe Andorians were impressed with your negotiating skills. If I agree to a meeting, it's simply legitimises their position. They probably intend to re-supply their troops on the surface. We won't allow that. That will be their decision. You don't understand the complexities of this situation. I didn't request your help, Captain, and I don't feel obliged toaccept it. Didn't you hear the Captain? The ball is in our court. Thank you for the reassurance. Now if you don't mind, I'll needa few moments of silence to prepare myself. I suggest we cancel the negotiations and return to your ship. Now you see who you're dealing with, Captain? The southeast quadrant, near the old spaceport. I told you Inegotiated the last accord. I also served here. As an intelligence officer, a long time ago. Our currentdeployment has a base of operations that way, about two and a halfkilometres. Circumstances have altered our plans. Shran just tried to kill us. I suppose you think our troops are responsible for this? Are you that naive? Shran is using you. Perhaps you were farther off course thanyou thought. It's been almost a hundred years. This is the old residential quarter. According to our latestintelligence, the Andorians control the settlement west of here. Not quite the warm welcome you expected, Captain? We should try to make contact with them. What do you recommend? Wandering through these ruins until wefind an Andorian soldier, and trust he's been informed not to shoot uson sight? What is their fixation with our ears? Do you realise you've picked up a slight human accent? You wereone of the most promising members of my staff, T'Pol. If you'd stayedin San Francisco, you'd be the Assistant Counsel by now. You might evenhave a diplomatic posting of your own. Then why have you remained on Enterprise? Captain Archer's record is evidence of that, but there areothers who can assist them. Gratification is an emotional indulgence. You disagreed with ourrecommendation that Archer's mission be cancelled after the tragedy atParaaga Two. Why? You believed you knew better than the High Command? That soundsa great deal like another emotion, arrogance. Perhaps it's time for youto consider another assignment. What do you expect me to do with this? I haven't fired a weapon in fifty years. Commander, it seems you're willing to resolve this situationthrough peaceful means. Do all your officers feel the same? I consider any negotiation that averts war to be a success. Vulcans don't drink. But this occasion merits an exception. And to the successful continuation of these talks on Andoria. Captain, your presence here has not been overly meddlesome."
1329,ENT,episode 39,T'POL,"They're rated for one hundred and twenty. When the Andorians first arrived a century ago, they began toterraform the planet. Once an atmosphere was developed, theyestablished a settlement. Its sole value is its strategic location near Vulcan space. It was the only logical conclusion. How much evidence would you need if the Klingons decided to setup a colony on Pluto? The Andorians refused to let the High Command inspect thecolony. So, they annexed Paan Mokar to protect their territory. They were removed. They left the High Command little choice. A surveillancesatellite was put into orbit to monitor the agreement. The planet'sbeen deserted for nearly a century. It's the Andorian jamming signal. I'm entering the landingcoordinates they gave us. Did you have a chance to read the Territorial Compromise? The Compromise is at the heart of this dispute. It's worth yourattention. Did you glance at any of the other materials I sent to yourquarters? V'Lar's treatise on negotiating tactics is the definitivetext on the subject. Glancing. Ambassador Soval clearly believes you'll fail. I was hoping someadvance preparation would help you prove him wrong. I assume you have a strategy? And then? Yes. Captain. You provoked this situation when you violated the TerritorialCompromise. After you set up a military outpost here. Is there something you'd like to discuss? As Shran said, this is a provocative issue. However, I think youdid well. But my opinion often differs from the High Command's. Engaging an Andorian vessel could be construed as an act of war. It's a human expression. It means the next move is yours. Weapons fire. I can't pinpoint the source. We're still within their jamming range. Direct hit to our starboard engine. Main power is offline. We're losing altitude. Two hundred metres. One hundred metres. Fifty. We need to reduce our speed. You were with the occupation force? The Vulcan units must be advancing their positions. Captain. I believe they're envious. I am aware of that. We believed they needed our help when they first developed warpdrive. That hasn't changed. I find the work gratifying. I was onboard Enterprise at the time. I felt my opinion would bewelcomed. Just because Captain Archer has earned my respect doesn't mean Ihave been contaminated by his emotions. Didyou make contact? Those are Andorian weapons. It isn't life-threatening but he needs medical attention. Have you considered there might be Andorians who would want awar with Vulcan? With your permission, I'll escort Ambassador Soval to theairlock."
1330,ENT,episode 39,TUCKER,"I don't like pushing the engines thishard. The injectors arerunning at a hundred and ten percent. And my underwear is flame-retardant. That doesn't mean I'mgoing to light myself on fire to prove it. Class D? That's uninhabitable. Why are you fighting over it? Was there any evidence? That's not the same thing. By force. Unbelievable. I damn near burn up the warp reactor gettinghere, and they make us wait. Naturally. I don't like this. With all the interference, you won't be ableto contact the ship if something goes wrong. Those Andorian ships'll be here in four hours. T'Pol said that Territorial Compromise they were talking abouttook eight years to work out. How would you know? We can't pick upanything through the interference. Where? We want to be involved in any rescue operation. I know. I once saw one of your commando units blast the hellout of a rebel compound during a rescue mission. You don't even know where they are. Do you really think it's agood idea to go down there guns blazing? Any luck? See what you can do. How far away are those Andorian ships? You have something? That's the Captain? At least we know he's alive. Where is he? What's the status on those Andorian ships? Put the ship on Tactical Alert. Range. Travis, lay in a new course. I want you to put us right betweenthem. Put 'em both on. This is Commander Tucker. That includes yours, Sub-commander. Don't. I'll open fire on any ship that makes an aggressivemove. Phase-cannons? As long as my Captain is stuck in the middle of your war zone,it is. Don't count him out so fast. We've managed to isolate hisbio-signature. Now, why don't you both give him and Ambassador Soval achance to do their jobs before we start a war up here? Arm the forward phase-cannons. See if you can target theirweapons. Hold off, Malcolm. Put him through. Captain. What's going on down there? Are you okay? Did you say Shran's medics? Glad you let us know. Nothing we couldn't handle. I'll fill you in later. I'll send Travis down in Shuttlepod Two. Put us back into orbit, Travis, and cancel the tactical alert. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Ambassador Sovalhas begun talks with the Andorians. They've been difficult, butproductive."

They weren't overly enthusiastic about you takingcommand of Enterprise in the first place, and now your presence iscrucial to their interests. All finished.

The Vulcans want to discuss termsfor a cease fire. There is another option. Someone I've dealt with. A pinkskin. He's proven to be quite even-handed in dealing with Vulcans. His nameis Archer. The pinkskin sense of humour. My apologies for the securityprecautions. I'm sure they do. We're aggressive, illogical. That's why you're here, Captain. To help us do just that. I'vedealt with the Vulcans twice before, where you were involved. Bothtimes you handled the situation without prejudice. They haven't been harmed. As you can see, Captain, even after a hundred years, thissituation still evokes anger on both sides. We will release ourprisoners on the following conditions. Immediate withdrawal of allVulcan military forces, the so-called compromise is to be rescinded,and the Vulcans must concede irrevocable sovereignty of Weytahn toAndoria. The Vulcans always say they're ready to talk, but it amounts tonothing. Treaty negotiations that drag on for years. I want to speak toSoval. Somebody who can deal with the situation without having to checkwith his superiors. Here. On my terms. Haven't they already taken enough? No. One, as a show of our good faith. Bring them here as soon asthey land, and treat the Vulcan with respect. You don't have to. I know what you're going to say. Wediscovered this planet. We made it livable. It belongs to us. Don'tworry, it'll be ours again. I'm willing to give Archer another chance. Not always. I've seen that for myself. Your recommendation is noted. Enough. I value your opinion, Tarah, but that does not allow youto question my commands. Dismissed. That shuttle was to be left alone. I gavespecific orders. Then who fired those shots? The Vulcans, I suppose, trying tokill their own Ambassador? They are devious, but I doubt even they would go that far. You're not happy with the way I've handled this situation? Put our positions on alert. I want Soval and the pinkskinbrought to me alive. If they're looking for an excuse to attack, wewon't give it to them. Why would my lieutenant, a loyal member of the Imperial Guard,lie to me? Is this true? Answer me! Follow my orders! I intend to. Take her. See to the Ambassador's wounds. We have a lot to discuss. The Imperial Council will not be satisfieduntil Vulcan recognises our claim to Weytahn. In that case, these talks have been extremely successful. Join me in a drink tocelebrate our mutual dissatisfaction. To the ceaseÂ fire. It wouldn't have been possible without thehelp of our human friends. I trust there'll be more accomplished than just talk. I think he likes you, pinkskin."

We've taken more casualties. Have you ever known a Vulcan who wouldn't lie to get what hewanted? Don't move, Vulcan. He's expecting you, without a Vulcan escort. We can never be too vigilant when it comes to Vulcans. Hostages? Criminals take hostages. Kidnappers looking for aransom take hostages. I assume you're referring to the enemy soldierswe captured. When they attacked us, two of my men were badly wounded. They're lucky we didn't kill them. Only a Vulcan could call a hundred years ofoppression a compromise. You annexed a planet that belongs to us,herded our people into refugee camps. I told you. He's a puppet of the Vulcans. This is pointless. And give away our only advantage? If I may speak. How? By talking? We've been trying that for a hundred years, andit's gotten us nowhere. They stall and lie and make promises they neverintend to keep. We came here to fight. Why back down now? You put too much faith in these pinkskins. We don't knowanything about them except that they're friends of the Vulcans. If we attack now, we can have the Vulcans on the defensivebefore our ships arrive. Our troops are ready. There's no reason to wait. And they were followed. Is that so unlikely? Some of my men saw weapons fire coming fromtheir positions. It's Vulcan subterfuge, I'm sure of it. What betterway for them to justify an invasion than to blame us for killing theirenvoy? You act as if they have some moral code. They have noconscience, only their precious logic. They'll do anything to drive usoff this planet. We should never have agreed to negotiate. Of course I am, sir. I'll see to it myself. Empty. No. The pinkskin will want to keep his part of the bargain. They'll be looking for Shran. It doesn't have a stun setting. All we want is a chance to fight for what's ours before cowardslike Shran negotiate it away. He was ready to kill me. You saw foryourself. Apparently, these pinkskins aren't as honourable as youthought. How long have I served with you? Followed your orders when itcould have meant my life? What did you expect me to do? Orders to do nothing while you betray us? It's not too late toredeem yourself, to make a stand. There are others who feel this way. You'll see."
1494,ENT,episode 39,MUROC,"We've regained control of half the colony, but two dozen Vulcanshave been wounded and three have been taken hostage. That may happen sooner than you realise. While you were on thesurface, we detected three Andorian vessels approaching. They'll behere in less than five hours. This isn't wise. The colony hasn't beensecured. Our scanners are more sophisticated than yours. We detected weapons fire coming from the surface. Then your shuttleappeared to make an emergency landing somewhere in the colony. We haven't been able to pinpoint their landingsite, but our units on the ground are already searching. The HighCommand instructed me to take steps to recover Ambassador Soval. Of course. We have more experience in these matters. We won't allow this provocation to continue. Our response will be appropriate. I'll keep youinformed, Commander. Commander, I strongly recommend you withdraw toa safe distance. We will not allow the Andorians to landadditional troops on Paan Mokar. Any vessel attempting to enter orbit will befired upon. This is not a Starfleet matter. The Andorians have made it impossible for us torecover Captain Archer. By now, he's most likely a casualty."

1498,ENT,episode 40,ARCHER,"Biosigns? Any idea what happened? Bring it into Launch bay two. Whoever this is, he's rewritten our history books. Can you geta sample? If he's a member of Starfleet, his genetic profile is probablyin our database. Run a comparison as soon as you can. I wonder if this could be Zephram Cochrane. They say he waspiloting a one-man vessel when he disappeared. There were a lot of rumours after he was lost. One of them saidhe was testing some kind of experimental warp ship. Any markings on thehull or control panels? Any new mission you haven't told us about? Phlox has sent a request to Doctor Cochrane's family. They'retransmitting his genetic profile. If we haven't, we've discovered an even bigger mystery. Let's see it. I don't believe I've had the pleasure That ship's an Earth vessel. The pilot's human. I'm curious. What's your interest in that ship? There's notmuch left. You might want to contact your superiors. Ask for a man namedSilik. He'll tell you I don't respond well to threats. Bring us about, Travis. Power the phase-cannons. See what youcan do about their weapons. Lock them out. Archer to Trip. Send a security team down there. Return fire. Target their engines, and bring the grappler on line. They wanted that ship pretty badly. I'd like to know why. Stay with them. What's your guess? Bigger on the inside? Archer. Is there a match in the Starfleet Database? How did a human end up with Vulcan DNA? That's not possible. We haven't known the Vulcans long enough. Thank you, Doctor. T'Pol. {Daniel's quarters] Our time-travelling friend Daniels left it in his quarters. We'll keep it to ourselves. That's because it hasn't been built yet. Worried about contaminating your genome with a little humanDNA? That could be it. If a human and a Vulcan did havea child, I wonder if he'd have pointed ears. There. I think that's it. Look at the commission date. That's almost nine hundred years from now. Daniels talked about historians from the future. People who traveledback to study the past. That could be what this pilot was doing. If the Suliban get their hands on this, they'll take it apart, maybe learn how the engines work. That couldchange the course of the Temporal Cold War. Archer. Suliban? T'Pol? Open a channel. This is Captain Archer of the Starship Is there something we can do for you? I'd like to know how you heard about that ship. Thanks for the warning, but we can't give it to you. Hull plating. Arm the aft torpedoes. Release us, or I'll destroy the ship in our launch bay. Do you hear me? What did he say? I wonder if there's anyone else who thinks they have a claim onthat ship. This may be the temporal radiation the Tholians warned usabout. Or maybe they really were reliving the same moment. Seal offLaunch bay two and evacuate the surrounding sections. I don't want totake any chances. How are you coming with the black box? Let me know as soon as you find anything. Dismissed. We'll keep an eye on it. The Vulcans are only a few hours away. I'm pretty sure we can steer clear of them. I'm not going to do that. I'm tired of these factionsinterfering with our century. It's time we took a more active interestin this war, gathered some intelligence ourselves. Like it or not, we've been involved since we left Spacedock. Daniel's hinted that there were other factions in this conflict. Maybethe Tholians are working for one of them. This is the first chance we've had to get some answers. I'm notgoing to pass it up. The Vulcans can get that ship back to Earth in afew weeks. Starfleet'll take it from there. I told you. I've made my decision. What do you have? On my way. Go to maximum warp. How long to the rendezvous point? Contact the Tal'Kir. Let them know we're bringing company. I see you brought some friends with you. Or what? You're not going to risk any more damage to that ship. Take a look at your long-range sensors. There's a Vulcan combatcruiser a few million kilometres from here. Unless you want to upsetthem, I suggest you turn around. Aft cannon, return fire. The Vulcans? Hold your course and speed. Take us out of warp. Biosigns? Take us back to warp. Weapons? Trip, we could use warp engines Right about now. How about weapons? Then forget everything else. Get that beacon working. Whoever built that ship might be able tosend help. How long would it take to remove one of the torpedo warheads,arm it manually? Then we'll bring the torpedo to the launch bay, work on itthere. You have the bridge. I'm going to hold you to that fourminutes. They don't make this easy, do they? Go ahead. We're working as fast as we can. Stand by. I'm going to hold you to that four minutes. You're right. How far do you think we got last time? I think we may have removed the warhead. We'd better hurry. The red and blue conduits, right? Get to the control room. I'll take it fromhere. I'm going to hold you to that four minutes. How many times do you think we've done this? Let's hope we've got it down by now. Control room. Let's get those doors open. Now. Now! On our way. Gone? Why didn't they fire on us? The Vulcans? Let's see if we can give them a hand. Prep ashuttlepod. Have Doctor Phlox meet us in Launch bay one. You're forgetting that time is irrelevant to these people. If that vessel was from the future, whoever sent it had plentyof time to locate the signal and then travel back to any point in timeto retrieve it. I'm going to contact the High Command, apologise for thetrouble we caused them. I also need to thank them for helping us out. By all means. I wonder if they'll believe that humans andVulcans will be swapping chromosomes one day?"

If it is, it's been fused shut. With your permission, sir? The hull seems to absorb EM radiation. Without all this damage, it never would have shown up on our sensors. Maybe he got a ride from someone. Could be an escape pod. Commander. Registers as some kind of bio-matter. Maybe we should get Phlox to come down and take a look. I see it. It could be a hologram. You're not going down there? We should call the Bridge first. Let them know This gives space exploration a whole new meaning. You're the engineer. I'm picking up an energy signature. It's very faint. Commander! I'm getting unusual thermal readings. It's awfully warm insidethat ship, more than two hundred degrees. That beam's interfering with our targeting scanners. Assuming that is the power grid. It boggles the mind, if youthink about it. That ship could be from the thirty first century. When I wasyoung, I always wanted to build a time machine, see the future. Don't tell me you've never wondered what it would be like. Howour mission will turn out. If Daniels came here and offered you a chance to go to the thirtyfirst century, you wouldn't take it? And you call yourself an explorer. Absolutely. Think of all the awkward first dates I could avoid. Sounds perfect. If we're happily ever after, what difference does it make? They're similar to the ones in the cockpit. He'd probably make a quick meal of you. If I could travel back in time, I know exactly what year I'dpick. 1588. England defeated the Spanish Armada. He'd probably make a quick meal of you. It seems like we were just in here. If I could travel back, Iknow exactly what year I'd pick. I think we're spending far too much time together. I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus. The stegosaurus was a herbivore. We didn't imagine what happened. We've spent a fair amount of time around that ship. They're charging weapons. We're losing ventral plating. Direct hit to the launch bay doors. They're trying to blast themopen. They're offline, too. The hull plating's depolarising. I never thought I'd be glad to see the Suliban. Four minutes. Less if I had some help. I recommend moving thewarhead as little as possible once we remove it. It was only an estimate, sir. I'm going to release the couplings. You'll need to disconnect thepower conduits. The blue and red ones first. Turn the releasecounterclockwise until you feel it detach. Sir, if you'll hold it by the locking brace. It was only an estimate, sir. It's happening again. We've hadthis conversation before. I'm not certain. If time's not repeating outside the launch bay, the Tholianscould be close. Aye, Captain. It was only an estimate, sir. At least twice, maybe more. I'd recommend putting more distance between us and that ship. Good question."

There aren't any ships or inhabited systems for several lightyears. How could he have travelled this far? We haven't found any. It's Suliban. Minimal weapons. I don't believe it's a combat ship. They're charging weapons. Forward plating is holding. Their weapons have been disabled. Sir? It could it tell us what happened, maybe even who built thevessel. A database from the future? I'm not certain Daniels would approve of this. A Vulcan cruiser. I don't recognise the configuration. Few Vulcans have ever chosen to mate with another species. There are significant biological differences between thespecies. It's unlikely we could reproduce. Humans and Vulcans. The dorsal section is the wrong shape. This says it's powered by a temporal displacement drive. Assuming the vessel is from the future, why haven't theyretrieved it? The vessel's Tholian. They're extremely xenophobic. The HighCommand has had limited contact with them. Captain, it's unusual forTholians to travel this far from their system. They're believe to be a non-humanoid species. They've locked on to us with a tractor beam. Please. The Captain asked me to perform a metallurgical analysis of thevessel's hull. I've discovered several unusual alloys. One of them is in asemi-fluidic state. To say the least. That's his theory. Perhaps. It's not an opinion. It's simple logic. Are you saying you believe time travel is possible? I prefer to embrace logic. If you'll excuse me, Doctor. Captain, the craft is emitting some type of high-energyparticles. The radiation could have affected your perception of time. Can I speak with you? The radiation could spread to othersections, affect more systems. I'm not certain we'll survive that long. We've attracted theattention of two hostile species. It's logical to assume they'researching for us. Perhaps you should destroy the vessel. Assuming for the moment the Temporal Cold War exists, I believewe shouldn't get involved. Your curiosity is placing Enterprise in unnecessary danger. Captain. If the Suliban return, they may be cloaked. I recommend we go toTactical Alert. Bridge to Captain Archer. Several Suliban vessels areapproaching. Acknowledged. The ships will be within weapons range intwenty seconds. They're matching our speed. Less than three minutes. Six hundred thousand kilometres. Two hundred thousand kilometres. The crew's alive. The vessel is disabled. The cell ships have dropped out of warp. Even if you're correct, it's unlikely helpwill arrive in time. Bridge to Captain Archer. The Suliban have lost more than half of their ships. You don't have much time. How many? We're prepared to surrender it to you, but our launch bay doorstook heavy damage. We're going to need more time. I have a repair teamworking on it, but they estimate it will take Seal the hatches and send security teams. T'Pol to Captain Archer. They've neutralised the warhead. It dematerialised, and it's not aboard the Tholian ships. They may have only wanted the vessel. Their warp drive is damaged, but life support is stable. There's no evidence to support that. As the captain of the Tal'Kir pointed out, a ship can bereplaced. I'm sure the gesture would be appreciated. The High Command hasasked me to prepare a report on this incident, with your permission. They're more likely to believe in time travel. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

1510,ENT,episode 40,TUCKER,"Some kind of stealth ship. So what do you think, Travis? Couldthis pilot have been a cargo hauler? That's got to be a world record for hitchhiking. I still can'tfind any plasma exhaust ports. Not even a thruster quad. How did this thing make it into deep space without an engine? Even an escape pod would need some kind of propulsion system. Organic circuitry? Not a bad idea. What's this? Malcolm? Good. Means I'm not hallucinating. How can a ship be bigger onthe inside than the outside? Hand me that hyperspanner. Got to get my spanner back. Say again, Malcolm? I've read a few papers on spatial geometry. I never heard atheory that would explain this. The Captain'll never believe us. He'sgoing to have to see this for himself. What do you think, a warp reactor? Looks like a breach, overload of some kind. This could be a release pin. Let's getit to Engineering. Tucker to the Bridge. The comm.'s down. It was heavily shielded. Whatever this thing is, it must bepretty important. Might be the black box. That's assuming we can get it working. It seems to use the sameorganic circuitry as the rest of the ship. Captain, I got to take youdown into that chamber. You're not going to believe your eyes. All right, let's start reinitialising thepower grid. What does? You're probably the kind of person that jumps to the end of abook before you read it. Wondering about the future and knowing it are two differentthings. Some things are better left a mystery. Where's the fun in exploring if you know how it all turns out? Hand me that micro-caliper. Suppose you could look into some futurebook and find out the name of the woman you're going to marry. Wouldyou want to know it? Fine. So one day you meet Jane Doe. You go out a few times, andyou pop the question. She says I do, and the two you live happily everafter. Now, did you marry her for love, or because some book told youto? Well, we've got power. Now we've got to figure out how to tapinto these organic circuits. We might be able to salvage some of them, build an interface. Now if I had a chance to see the past, I'djump at it. I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus. The stegosaurus was an herbivore. What happened in 1588? I'm sure some named Reed had a lot to do with that. Now if I had a chance to see the past, I'djump at it. I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus. The stegosaurus was an herbivore. How'd I know you were going to say that? Now, if I had a chance to see the past, I'djump at it. He'd probably make a quick meal of you. It was the weirdest thing. When we werestanding next to the ship, it felt like we were having the sameconversation over and over again. How do you explain what happened? The power's online, but we still can't access the data. It's what we don't have. This isn't a black box. We thought itwas a data storage matrix, but after we got the power running itstarted generating a subspace signature. I think it's amicro-transmitter, some kind of emergency beacon. The antimatter injectors are fused. I'll need a few hours toreplace them. Every power relay on the ship's been scrambled. Sir? Aye, Captain. I need that power module. All right, hand me a micro-caliper. I wish we'd had more time to explore thatship. Who knows how many other rooms were down there? Looks like theysent the whole kit and caboodle back to the thirty first century. Well, there's no evidence to contradict it, either. What Idon't understand is how quickly everything disappeared. That beacon wasonline for less than a minute. Irrelevant? Unfortunately, time isn't irrelevant in my engine room. I'vegot repairs to finish. See you later. Sub-Commander."

The tissue damage is extensive, but I should be able to isolatea few fragments. Absolutely. Sickbay to Captain Archer. I need to see you immediately. I managed to find only a few undamagedcells, but they were enough to complete a genetic analysis. No, but I did discover that our guest is no ordinary human. Ifound an unusual deviation in this nucleotide sequence. At first Ithought I was looking at some kind of mutation, but there was somethingfamiliar about the chromosome structure, so I widened my search toinclude the interspecies database. This nucleotide sequence is Vulcan. The likeliest explanation is that he had at least one Vulcanancestor further back than a great-grandparent. I also found genetic material belonging to several otherspecies. This sequence is Terrelian. There's another I can't identify. I believe this individual is the result of several generations ofinterspecies breeding. May I join you? I found another nucleotide sequence in the pilot's genome. Itappears to be Rigelian. That corpse is full of surprises. I didn't realise how late it was until my stomach reminded me itwas time to eat. You seem to be engrossed in your work as well. Anything noteworthy? More mysteries. I understand Captain Archer believes that the vessel travelledhere from the future. Genetic anomalies, unexplainable alloys, the evidence seems tobe mounting. The Vulcan Science Directorate. They've always been ratherreluctant to embrace unorthodox ideas. After they review our findings,I have a feeling they might reconsider their opinion of time travel. There was a time when Denobulans believed they were the onlyintelligent species in the galaxy. Needless to say, it was quite asurprise when the B'Saari made First Contact. Many refused to acceptthe truth even with the evidence standing right in front of them. Ittook some time, and it wasn't easy, but eventually we were forced toreevaluate our beliefs. Surprises, Sub-Commander. I believe in embracing surprises. Good night. I can't find anything wrong with either of you. The particle density's quite low. It's unlikely to have anylasting effects."

1679,ENT,episode 41,ARCHER,"Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Trip and I have left Keto-Enol, where we had a successful first contact with the Enolians. We also found time to squeeze in a little R + R. You in charge here? If you're not, I need to speak to your superior officer. I'm okay. Do you know where they're taking us? I heard something about Canamar. I assume that's where we're going. They think we're smugglers. Hopefully, there'll be a judge or someone on that processing station we can talk to. You might want to make friends with that Nausicaan. You ever fly a warp ship before? It's harder than you think. You hit the wrong control, you could overload the plasma manifolds or shut down the antimatter containment field. We'd all end up a cloud of ionised gas. A damn good one. I'm a smuggler, remember? My partner's an engineer. I could use his help. Every ship's different. Give me some time. These look like landing thrusters, attitude control, warp stabilizers. Navigation. This one? Which planet? We're not going to get very far in a stolen Because we're innocent. I have friends who wanted to keep doing business with me. They made a few discreet payments and now I'm innocent. I would have been off this ship by now if you hadn't staged your little revolt. I hope you've thought this through. I'm curious. How'd you get out of those restraints? You couldn't have a lock pick, the guards would have found it. How did you know you were going to need them? I don't know what you have in mind, but I'm involved now. I don't want to go to Canamar any more than you do. If we run into trouble, my partner could help. Subspace transceiver. I'm taking it offline. It leaves a subspace signature. Even when it's not transmitting, someone could track us. We're new to this region. We used to work mostly in the Sol system. That's our sun. Our homeworld is called Earth. Two vessels approaching from aft. They've found us. You think I sent a distress call? I told you we should have gotten rid of this ship. It's too easy to track. They're charging weapons. Those are heavily armed patrol ships. We're only a transport. We're outgunned. I'd rather take my chances on Canamar. They're targeting our engines. No. We don't have the firepower. If we attack those ships, they'll destroy us. I think I can get us out of this, but I'll need Tucker's help. Trip, what's your status? Now. They've taken damage. Propulsion is down on both ships. We should get out of here while we can. There's no need. Do you think the Enolians are just going to give up if we destroy two of their ships? All I'm wanted for is smuggling. I don't need to add murder charges to it. Let me get us out of here. I used it once before, outrunning a customs vessel near Coridan. Every ship leaving Keto-Enol was being boarded and searched. To get through the checkpoint, I said I was a starship captain and Tucker was my engineer. I made quite a point about how I was on a peaceful mission of exploration. What do you think? They turned our shuttle inside out, found my cargo, and we wound up here. Doing what? I'm a smuggler. I'm not good at much else. It's not as if I have a lot of options right now. Before we're going to work together, I'd like to know where we're headed. And then? This thruster assembly took a lot of damage. We should have Tucker take a look at it. You're not the one who has to fly this thing. It's better than nothing. Sounds like you started your career early. No? That sounds pretty severe. Welcome to Tamaal. Where are your friends? Do you have landing coordinates? What about the others? Are you going to let them go to prison? It'll be incinerated. Why kill all these people? Just leave them. The docking hatch was damaged by the patrol ships. Kuroda wants Tucker to see if he can repair it. Your guess is as good as mine. He's taking us off on a shuttle. Then he plans to crash the ship. We can't wait for Enterprise. We've got to try to take control. Think you can handle him? Their ship might be big enough to hold everyone here. Why don't we take them along? Trip. How's that docking port coming? Do your best. Do you know how to repair that docking hatch? It's not easy. We're in a decaying orbit. Shoot me and you'll die with the others. You don't have to kill these people. They've docked. I see my message got through. This will open the restraints. Get everyone on that shuttle. Not unless you have a spare thruster assembly. Is everyone off? I'll be right there. He won't have to. Let's go. Â  It's too late. We've lost thrusters. We've got to get out! Kuroda. It's over. We've got some men in there who could use your help. I'll be fine. Trip. I'll give you one right now. Kuroda's dead, the other eleven prisoners are under guard. As you're aware, my Engineer and I were falsely arrested. We almost wound up in Canamar. Makes me wonder how many others don't belong there. You wanted a report? You've got one.<Back to the episode listingStar Trek Â® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Perhaps you could find out if any of your officers have seen them. Where are they? I trust you'll accompany us to ensure there are no further mistakes. Your transport vessel? Try hailing them.

He's my Captain. What if Enterprise doesn't find the shuttlepod? And if not? We're not criminals. He's right. What? Sounds terrific. Ask him. I'll take my chances with my own face. Can't say I have. Imagine that. Excuse me. Can I change seats? Let us go! I don't want to die tied up like an animal! Ready when you are. The plasma vents are open. Is this really necessary? I just saved your skin and you still don't trust me. Do you know how much power flows through those plasma conduits? A lot. I could have been electrocuted. The least you could do is say thanks. Shut up! Enough. No. I love hearing how delicious Melvaran mud fleas are or about the time you spent two hours with an Orion slave girl or the miracles doctors can perform these days, getting rid of Fluvian fungus! I haven't told you any. You won't let me get a word in edgewise. I can't even put my fingers in my ears. Ten minutes, that's all I'm asking. Just ten minutes of silence. Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you, but this isn't exactly the best place to socialise. Nice of you to visit. I hope you've got something else in mind. Yeah, piece of cake. I need a minute. It's a big job. Listen, I know we kind of got off on the wrong foot. No hard feelings. But now that we're friends, I could use a hand. True. But I'm having trouble getting the intake valve open. I guess I don't have the muscle for it. Unless I'm mistaken, Kuroda wants this hatch repaired. That one. If you could turn it counter-clockwise. Yeah, a little more. It's got to go at least ninety degrees. That's it. You almost got it. They lied. They're planning to kill you. All of you. Keep it down. What? Where's Archer? Captain, would you mind?

Unfortunately, that attracts just as many thieves and smugglers. As you might imagine, my officers are kept quite busy. I wish I could help you. A patrol ship intercepted their shuttle as it was leaving orbit. On board one of our transports. They were carrying what appeared to be contraband, so they were taken into custody. Smuggling is rampant in this system. My men have orders to board unfamiliar vessels. Mistakes can be made. I've contacted the transport. They're expecting you. These are the co-ordinates. That's one of our frequencies. We have hundreds of ships. I don't know the signatures for every one. We're still several hours away but we have patrol ships in that area. Pressurize your docking port and prepare to be boarded, or our next shot will breach your hull. Both our ships were disabled before the transport escaped. My superiors don't want our patrols taking any more chances. They've issued orders to destroy the prison transport. They're more concerned with the man who planned this escape. They were able to match his voice-print to a prisoner named Kuroda Lor-ehn. He was responsible for many crimes, some of them brutal. They're determined to stop him. Then I suggest you find them before our patrols do. Tamaal. It's a large trading outpost with over two million inhabitants. You're forgetting that's a prison ship. It's heavily shielded. It's not one of our ships. On behalf of the Enolian government, I'd like to extend our apologies for this inconvenience. My superiors will want Er, Captain? Captain, my superiors will want a report on"
1859,ENT,episode 41,ZOUMAS,"It's a penal colony. There's a processing station in orbit. You'll be tried, sentenced, and sent down to the surface. We're all guilty as far as they're concerned. Why did they take you? I wouldn't want to be accused of smuggling. They'll probably make an example of you. You should be careful with the Nausicaans. Nasty tempers. What were you smuggling? Latinum, Enolian spice wine? Captain of a starship? Interesting. I should have tried that when they took me. It might have helped. Captain Zoumas. I'm sure we're all grateful for your courageous effort, but we've been in these restraints for three days. Couldn't you Have you ever tried Tojal? There's nothing like it, but you have to eat it before it cools, otherwise it'll congeal. It's the first thing I'm going to have when we're off this ship. Where do you think they're taking us? I'll just wait and see. The Enolians won't stop looking for us. We'll be fugitives. I was thinking of having my face reconfigured. There's a surgeon on Burala Prime who can do it. He could help you as well. Have you ever been to Burala Prime? If you ever go, avoid the polar islands. The people are friendly, but the cold is unbearable. Nothing but ice and glaciers. I was stranded there for three months when some colleagues of mine decided to leave without me. The day I got lost, that was the worst. Fourteen hours. It took me fourteen hours to find my way back to the outpost. I lost three toes to frostbite. I've walked with a slight limp ever since, not that you'd notice. I'm going to get that surgeon to do some work on my foot as well. Maybe he can replace the missing toes. What's happening? Shouldn't we be getting to the escape pods? Let us go! I don't want to die tied up like an animal! How much? That was nice. It reminds me of the time I was on Once you get past the texture, they really don't taste that bad. The fun part is keeping them in your mouth. They jump around until you crunch down on them. Is something wrong? Well, what makes you think I want to hear your stories? I didn't realise I was being so annoying. We seemed to begetting along so well. I just thought it might be nice to have apleasant conversation before I spend the next ten years in a penalcolony. They said they were going to let us go! You're going to get us sent to Canamar. Watch out! You should thank me. He's with them, repairing the docking hatch. They said there's a shuttle coming for us. I'm sorry I had to intervene, but you didn't give me much choice. You're lucky they didn't kill you. Kuroda was furious, but everything's fine now. They're going to set us free. You're welcome. Who are these people?"
1860,ENT,episode 41,KURODA,"I'd stay quiet if I were you. The guards don't like questions. Keep still, all of you, if you want to get out of here. I told you we needed the pilot. Does he look like he's in any condition to fly this ship? Just watch them! You'll be released soon enough. Be patient. You'll find out. Quiet! I'll see if I can access navigation. You're a pilot? Come with me. Just you. I thought you were a pilot. Navigation? There's a binary system four light years from here. Set a course. I'll tell you that when we get there. Just get me to that system. The guard said you were going to be released. Why? Every detail. Would they? Subdermal implants. They depolarise triburnium alloys. I served seven years on Canamar before I escaped. I don't intend to go back. So, I left prepared. What is that? I hope you're not trying to send a message. Now it's offline. I'm surprised we haven't crossed paths before. Sol? What is it? Let me see them. Enolian patrol ships. More quickly than I expected. When you were taking the transceiver offline, you didn't activate it accidentally? Do the same. We have weapons. use them. And I'd rather not. Now charge the weapons. Return fire! I'm warning you. Cease fire, cease fire. We surrender. 2 Acknowledged. Lock weapons. Target their warp reactors. As soon as they repair the damage they'll come after us again. All right. That was a clever trick, igniting the plasma. You obviously ran out of clever tricks, otherwise you wouldn't be here. What happened? They didn't believe you? My good fortune. You should consider coming with us. Your partner, too. I have some business I wasn't able to finish before I was arrested. It could be profitable. Trust me, you'll be very interested when you find out what I have in mind. The fourth planet. There's a trading outpost called Tamaal. A ship's going to meet us there. This transport draws too much attention. Don't bother. It won't be flying much longer. I'm not hungry. I can wait. I said I'm not hungry. Prison rations! You've obviously never spent time on a penal colony. I was fourteen when I first tasted those rations. I've had enough for one lifetime. I was young, but I was no criminal. My father and I were working at a transport yard on Keto-Enol. A supervisor accused me of stealing a brace of latinum. I had nothing to do with it, but they couldn't find anyone else to blame. I was sentenced to five years at Duronom. Enolian Guards are known for their severity. Haven't you seen that by now? I learned far more in prison than my father could have ever taught me. After I was released, I chose to put my new skills to use. I suppose I should be grateful. If it wasn't for the Enolian Guard, my life would have been quite dull. They'll be here. We're not landing. They're going to dock with us. No. Before we leave, you're going to set this ship on a decaying orbit. As far as anyone will be able to tell, we crashed trying to land. No one will be looking for us if they think we're dead. If you don't like it, you can always go back to your seat. I may not know how to fly this ship, but I'm sure I can figure out how to crash it. My friends will be here soon. Lay in a descent course. We have already discussed this! Stay here. Get to work. Move! We need to break orbit. You're lying! I won't go back!"

1864,ENT,episode 42,ARCHER,"How big is it? Put it up. Lookfamiliar? Try hailing them. Tactical alert. Go ahead. Warp or impulse? Hold on, Trip. Have they dropped out ofwarp? What about our life support? That's one piece of good news. Any biosigns out there? Rotate the dorsal camera. Hold it there. Tilt up about thirty degrees. Get closer. Any atmosphere? Prep a shuttlepod. Trip, meet me and Malcolm in Launch bay one. You're in charge. Keep a channel open. What's the temperature? Let's see what we can find. I doubt it's a coincidence. We may not be detecting any bio-signs, but those things surelook alive to me. Are you okay? Trip? That's what I was about to ask you. We should get him back to the ship. We're a hundred and fifty light years from Earth, Trip. He said he had some kind of out-of-body experience. You sure you're all right? I'd prefer to keep you in Sickbay for a few days, but I can'tafford to. I need you to get those engines back online. Let me know if you take another trip to Tarpon Beach. I want those weapons back online, too. Come in. It's like we're inthe belly of the beast. They're holding my ship hostage. We don't? Look out there. Do you see any stars? Our engines areoffline, our weapons. Seems kind of hostile to me. Is there something you wanted to see me about? And? I've got to get them out of here. Go ahead. What do you mean, wrong? I'll be right down. Did he say where he was going? Archer to Commander Tucker. Find him. Commander. Hungry? It's called bread. You've never eaten it before? Where's the man who used to be Charles Tucker? I want him back now. Where is he? Where do you come from? Why did you take Commander Tucker? I want my crewman, and I want my ship released. What about Tucker? Wow what? Who told you? I thought you were with Hopalong Cassidy and your girlfriend. Take him to Sickbay. We'll let the Doctor decide how fine you are. Something smells funny. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Now thatthe Doctor's given Trip a clean bill of health, my primary concern isto get Enterprise out of here. But Trip tells me it'll be awhile beforehe can get the engines online. From what we can tell, these life formshave no mass. Non-corporeal beings. that's got to be a first forStarfleet. T'Pol thinks they just want to get to know us. Maybe she'sright. Maybe I don't trust them because they're so different. I'd hateto think that was the case. Computer, pause. Come in. Everything all right? Are you sure you're all right? Go ahead. We're on our way. Enough! Humans don't like doing things without their consent. When are you planning to return Malcolm Reed? Oh, does it? Let's see how much you enjoy experiencing thehuman condition locked in Reed's quarters. They've got Malcolm. I need the ship Ready to go on my command. We'll see. A security detail locked him in Malcolm'squarters. Get it down, Trip. Go ahead, Trip. Hoshi, get a security team to Engineering. Have them put Crewman Rostov in his quarters. Then we're going to need more than one security team. Find outwho's acting strange and have them confined to their quarters. For the moment, we're going to have to hope they are. Start working on a way to figure out who's themselves and who'snot. Maybe Phlox can help you. Archer. Thanks, Trip. Hold our position. They've got Malcolm, and God knows how many others. Until wefind a way to get them back, we're not going anywhere. What's the big secret? What have you got? Doctor, whatever you've got, we need to put it to work. Get to work as soon as you're ready. Go ahead. Then you'd better stay where you are. Archer to Commander Tucker. Is there some kind of shielding In the nacelles that might keep thesealiens from getting in? Travis thinks it will. I need you to stop whatever you're doingand transfer all command functions To the starboard catwalk. We're goingto have to get everybody in there. I want you and T'Pol to get the crew upthere as quickly as you can. Hoshi. What? Security to the Bridge. You're taking over my crew. Why? We're kind of fond of our substance. We're not very anxious togive it up. Are you doing this for our benefit or for yours? Escort Ensign Sato to her quarters. How many? And outside? You okay, Travis? Trip? Thanks. What we need is to get our people back. Do you have something in mind? You wouldn't have a chance. One of those things would take youbefore you got back to the saucer section. What makes you think that? Even if you're right, what would you accomplish? It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it. And if you're wrong? Well, I'm not. They've already taken twenty four people. I'mnot going to give them another one. Is everything going all right, Doc? Good. T'Pol and I are going to need your help. Did you find her? Doesn't sound like that's the outcome sheexpected. Damn it. You'd better take her to her quarters. So they are doing this to save themselves. And lose a third of the crew? Unacceptable. We're going to find a way to get them back. Can they survive in a host that's dead? Archer to Phlox. That'll give you enough time toresuscitate them? Understood. Has anyone opened either of the ventral hatches? You must've missed him. All right. Does it have an ID tag? Good. Do you see the releases on either side? Open them. The silver ones first. Now pull the panel off. Whatever you want. Lay it down on the floor. Find the control panel. Each of them should have a switch next toit. Now, before we can release the gas into central ventilation,you're going to have to reroute the transfer lines to the carbondioxide tanks. Good. Now pull off the panel. It'll come off. You just need to use alittle muscle. Try using your foot For leverage. Okay. Now, the next part's a piece of cake. Stand by, Doc. What happened? What? We're going to have to speed things up, Doc. Trip's been taken. He left the catwalk a few minutes ago. If he tries to let his buddies out oftheir quarters we don't have any guards down there to stop him. You'll have to purge the osmotic filters. The valves are right behind thecontrol circuit. You're going to have to get two fingers through theupper holes in the support plate. Normally, that wouldn't be a problem, butwearing those gloves Could make it difficult. About three centimetres apart. You should be looking at two rotary valves and a lever. Open both valves all the way, then turn the lever to thethree o'clock position. That should do it. Go ahead. Good job. Vent the gas. Ready, Travis? Full impulse."

Weapons aren't charging, sir. They're offline. Phase cannons,torpedoes. Captain, look at this. The atmosphere's changing. Seventy six percent nitrogen, twenty onepercent oxygen. Eighteen degrees. I'm not reading anything. It's like they're not there. If there aren't any life-forms here, then who modified theatmosphere? It sounds like you were dreaming, Commander. I'll see what I can do. When we were outside, we saw a wisp of vapour penetrate him. Didyou have anything to do with that? Captain. Sir. Commander. B deck is fine. Are you a female? Your gender. You are a female, correct? I am a male. There seem to be a number of anatomical differences. Sub-Commander. You are very beautiful. Are you aware that you are the mostattractive woman on board this ship? Would you mind taking off your clothing? I'd like to learn moreabout your anatomy. If we are to engage in mating, it would be easier if youdisrobed. Are you afraid of me? You shouldn't be. What is it like being a female? Is it much different? If you'd allow the crossing, you'd find out. If you came to us, you could experience what it's like to bemale. Wouldn't that be helpful to you? You should. We're capable of letting you experience anything youwish for. It would be a shame not to take advantage of that. That depends."

1875,ENT,episode 42,T'POL,"It's approaching at warp six. It's not in the Vulcan database. There's no way to tell. Our sensors can't penetrate their hull. Fully operational. None that I can detect. The vapour doesn't contain any elements our sensors canidentify. Mostly helium, trace amounts of xenon. We have no reason to believe their motives are hostile. We don't know that. I suppose it depends on how you look at it. Ensign Sato is trying to communicate with the life forms. Nothing yet. I've spoken to a number of officers. They say thecrew is concerned, but remaining calm. Where's Commander Tucker? They've released the ship and Commander Tucker. They've doneeverything you've asked. Have you considered they may have been tellingthe truth when they said they were just curious about us? Come in. Is there something I can do for you? Do you think it's appropriate for you to be here at this hour? Have you been drinking? T'Pol to Captain Archer. Would you please come to my quarters with a security team. I'm capable of defending myself. I wouldn't know. I don't understand. I've never thought about it. This isn't Lieutenant Reed. We thought it best not to discuss this over the comm. We don'tknow who's been taken. There are two here. Fifty eight, including us. Twenty four locked in their quarters, and Doctor Phlox. We need to learn more about these life forms. It's illogical to believe we can do that without learning moreabout the aliens' intentions. I'd like your permission to leave the catwalk. Not necessarily. If a lifeform attempts to exchange itsconsciousness with mine, I believe I can prevent it. No offence, Captain, but the Vulcan mind is far more disciplinedthat yours. It can resist temptations, emotions, and I believe,invasions by these lifeforms. If an alien attempts this transfer, there may be a brief periodwhen our minds are conjoined. It's possible I can ascertain theirmotives. There's no other choice. It's a risk I'm willing to take. You told me you trust my judgment. Trust it now, unless you haveanother suggestion. They're lying to us. We don't have time for this, Phlox. I have to get to theCaptain. Their ship is deteriorating, and they haveno way to repair it. They can't survive in space. Eighty two of them are. One for every crewman on Enterprise. Hundreds. The rest will try to find another vessel of corporealbeings. Where's Commander Tucker? Please find him. If the Commander can find a wayto shield Enterprise, we can leave the catwalk and go to warp. Two thirds will survive. That may be difficult. It would be no different than being exposed to space. They'ddie. Not since we sealed them. Those six switches control the feed. You'regoing to have to recalibrate them in sequence for CO2. I'll guide you through it. If he knows what we're doing. There are two solenoids behind the openings. When you tap themsimultaneously, the plate should retract.  The nine o'clock position will vent the gas when we'refinished. They're in pursuit. Standby. Now."
1876,ENT,episode 42,TUCKER,"Tucker to the Bridge! What's going on, Captain? The engines just went down. Both. Aye, sir. Somebody seems to know what we like to breathe. Florida in November. Look at that. They sure look there to me. Captain. What the hell happened? I think I was up on the ceiling with those things. I waslooking down at the three of us, but not with my eyes. I can't explainit. I was in Tarpon Springs, too, swimming with Lisa. She wasafraid it was getting too dark. I know the difference between a dream and something reallyhappening. I'm telling you, I was there. I don't forget Florida, Captain. I don't care how far away itis. I was there. What happened to the comm.? You three talking about me? Thanks, Doc. I'm fine. I can't believe how amazing it was. I'll see what I can do. Tarpon Springs. I'll keep you posted. I'm fine. Goodbye, sir. Commander Charles Tucker III. Yes. It's all very good. Have you ever tried this? I've never eaten anything before. I'm here. Charles Tucker III. He's exploring another realm. My realm. But he'll be back. Please trust me. He's experiencing things he never thought hecould. It's not a question of where. He's no longer corporeal. But hewill be again, I assure you. Wisp. Interesting word. Wisp. Wisp. Yes, I suppose you couldcall us that. Wisp. We live in subspace. We travel through it. We're explorers,like you. It's been a long time since we've encountered corporeal beings. After we performed the first crossing with your commander, we realisedwe were compatible. You're very interesting. Trapped in bodies thatneed maintenance. You have gender. You require mates to reproduce. Youeat food. We were like you once, but we evolved. Now we can learn howour ancestors lived. Your crewman will be returned. You claim to be an explorer,Captain. Open your mind to new possibilities. I've enjoyed my time with you. Wow. I was riding right alongside Hopalong Cassidy chasing some badguys. Then I was with Lisa again, except this time we were snow sailingin New Zealand. Then I was eight years old, maybe nine, picking upleaves with my dad. But it wasn't a dream, Captain. It was as real asI'm sitting here. They told me you can try it. Anyone on the crew. They did. The ones I was with. I was, but it's hard to explain. You should try it. You'llunderstand what I'm talking about. You all should try it. Captain, I'm fine. Tucker. They're going to give him back, aren't they? What did you do with the, er? Right away, sir. You heard him. Let's try to prime the deuterium pumps and fire up theinjectors. Tucker to Ensign Cook. I need you and two other engineers down here right away. Quickly please. Tucker out. Something wrong? Run into a problem? Did you have any luck priming the pumps? Stay here. I'll be right back. Tucker to the Captain. It's Rostov, sir. I think you need to get Malcolm. I mean, whoever's running Security, downhere right away. Run into a problem? Great. Wait till I give you the signal. You've got impulse engines back, Captain. Tucker to Ensign Mayweather. I'm a little short-handed, Travis. Think I could get you to go back to thestarboard nacelle and re-polarise the warp coils? Call me when you get to the catwalk. Yes, Captain? The catwalk's reinforced with osmiumalloy, but it's hard to say if that would do it. I'm on it. I'm fine. What's going on, Doc? I was just at a barbecue. I've never seen so many ribs."

But myphysiology must not have been compatible. It left almost immediately. I'm fine. But it was disturbing. The lifeform was trying veryhard to reach me. It was simpler than I thought.

Everything will be all right. I'm afraid Ihave to insist. I promise you T'Pol! What is my name? Sub-Commander! My name. Yes, Captain. We'll have to purge the carbon dioxide within twenty seconds ofrespiratory failure. Oh, yes. It's enough time. Don't forget to close offthe ventilation to the starboard nacelle. We wouldn't want the gas to affect youand the others. Four, five, six, seven. Junction four one alpha. Atmospheric Recycling manifold. Yes. There are four of them. Two blue. Two silver. Done. What should I do with it? Very well. Right where you said it was, Captain. It's right here. It has six green lights. About five centimetres to the left. And how do I go about doing that? I've reached the access tube, Captain. It's not coming off. I've used every muscle I've got. it won'tbudge. Good suggestion. Tell me what to do. Back home, I'm known for my fine motor skills. I doubt a pair ofEV gloves Will deter me. Did you say there were two? Got it. I see them. Phlox to Captain Archer. Mission accomplished. I'm monitoring Commander Tucker. It's left Commander Tucker. In a moment, Captain. I need to be certain the CO2 levels areconsistent throughout the ship, that all the lifeforms are gone. It's done. Just breathe deeply. You'll be fine.

Enemies of the state aren't allowed visitors. Very thoughtful of her. Are they having any luck? When this is over, whatever the outcome, I'm counting on themto get Enterprise safely out of Klingon territory. Not so bad. Can't say I'm a big fan of Klingon cuisine. Thanks for the house call, Doc. Jonathan Archer. We haven't even discussed what happened. Well, I'm not familiar with your justice system. What can Iexpect out there? Do I get a chance to testify? How can you do that when you haven't heard what reallyhappened? What are they saying? I hope they're not the jury. Who's that? What about you? What's your success rate? Captain Archer of the battle cruiserEnterprise. By whose authority? I don't know your Chancellor, and I don't givea damn what he wants. I've formed an alliance with these people, andI'm going to support their revolt. Fire one shot, and you'll be joining yourancestors in the afterlife. I didn't say any of those things. Can't you object? They weren't traitors. Death to the Empire. You're not going to question him? I'd like a chance to defend myself. He's distorting the truth. Those people weren't rebels, and I wasn't trying to start arebellion. I am not your enemy! What is this? It's a little underdone. Sorry if I interfered with your legal strategy. How? I told you, they're not rebels. I haven't been able to say anything. I've a pretty good idea. Let's say I did co-operate. What would happen to these people? And end up in a court like this one? Tell the magistrate I'mgoing to pass on his offer. I know them well enough. They're good people, and I won't turnthem over. If you'd let me testify, tell my side of the story, it mightbecome clear why I helped them. But from what I've seen, you're allperfectly happy to ignore what you don't want to hear. No? What's your interpretation? Better or worse? Then maybe you should remind them of those different times. Nothing like a good history lesson. Even if your client's life depends on it? I get the feelingyou're as frustrated as I am. That you want to stand up to them. Butyou've given up. You're afraid of them. Then prove it. Challenge them. Show them what a real trial islike. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Earth Starship Enterprise. We answered a distress call. They were starving. Their lifesupport was failing. As I said, we had received a distress call. Magnify. Biosigns? Any response? Malcolm? Can you dock with them? Do your best. How long ago was that? What brought you out here? We knew that their colony had been abandoned. They were starving. They wouldn't have lasted another week. Apparently it wasn't yours, either. My Chief Engineer had determined that their vessel was beyondrepair. Some of the crew will have to double up, but I think we can accommodateall of them. They were headed for a system a few light years from here. Thatshould keep them safe from the Klingons. Looks like they didn't abandon the colonists after all. How long before they get here? Are all the refugees aboard? Cut their ship loose and go to tactical alert. I was preparing to defend my ship. They may have been subjects of the Empire, but it sure as helllooked like you had abandoned them. What's the composition of those rings? When we pulled that Klingon ship out of the gas giant, did youget a look at their sensor array? If we could ignite the plasma in those rings, would it disrupttheir sensors? A few seconds will have to do. Can you modify a torpedo? How long? Get moving. We had no intention of firing first. The Bortas had dropped out of warp with their weapons charged. Hail them. I'm Jonathan Archer, captain of the Starship Enterprise. I wasn't aware they'd committed any crime. From what I can tell, they are in no condition to inciteanything. Apparently their colony was abandoned by What do you intend to do with them? I'm sorry, but I'm not prepared to hand them over without alittle more information. If I could speak to someone in yourgovernment. Fair enough. Let's sit down and try to Head into the rings. Put us behind it. Stand by. Fire! Let's hope theirs are, too. Get us out of here. Yes. He refused. Yes. We left the system and took the refugees with us. Because Captain Duras is not my enemy. How long should it take for a verdict? Thanks for what you've done for me. What is it? What's it the blood of? I didn't say that. How many cases have you won? There are other classes? I guess I did. For thousands of years, my people had similar problems. Wefought three world wars that almost destroyed us. Whole generationswere nearly wiped out. A few courageous people began to realise they could make adifference. You all right? Not all Klingons are warriors. Remember? Leave him alone. You're welcome. We have a saying on Earth. You don't kick a man when he's down. Like what? Fair? It's in our nature. New arrivals? It's all right. He's from my ship. You, too. Lieutenant Reed, this is Kolos, my Advocate. How'd you get here? Is there room for one more? Come on. Why not? You realise what that means. You said most prisoners here don'tsurvive a year. Thank you. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Seventeen minutes. Yes, sir. Idon't suppose there's any chance of outrunning them. Sustained fire from our phase-cannons should be able to penetratetheir armour, but I doubt they'd sit still long enough to give us thechance. Pretty standard multi-spectral sensors, not too different fromours. For a few seconds. I believe so. How long do I have? Hull plating's at eighty percent. No damage to the Klingon ship. They're closing, sir. Four thousand metres. Three thousand metres. Two thousand. Eight hundred metres. Our sensors are down. And abandon the Captain? They're going to have to get there. Captain. It's good to see you, sir. Pleasure. T'Pol knows a few Klingon officials from her days in the Ministryof Security. One of them put us in touch with a corrections officer whowas willing to look the other way for the right price. I came on one ofthe dilithium barges. We bribed the captain to bring us here and takeus back to Enterprise. I imagine so, but we have to hurry. Captain?"
2060,ENT,episode 43,ALIEN,"Our warp drive failed three weeks after we left. We tried to set acourse for the nearest system at impulse, but main power went down. I don't know. Six weeks, maybe more. We diverted auxiliary powerto life support, but it wasn't enough. Food processors failed, waterrecyclers. When we left there were fifty four aboard. Several years ago, our colony was annexed by a species we hadnever seen before. They said they'd provide for us in exchange for ourallegiance, that we'd become a part of their Empire. But they strippedus of our resources, left us with nothing. We waited for them toreturn. They said they'd bring food, fuel. They never came back."

2062,ENT,episode 43,T'POL,"Twenty seven. I've already given the order. Considering the alternative was toset the ship adrift, I anticipated your decision. Where do you plan totake them? Empires tend to expand. They may eventually discover theyhaven't travelled far enough. It's a D5 battle cruiser. I doubt it's bringing supplies. Their maximum speed is warp six. Nothing unusual. Methaneice, isolytic plasma. Diamagnetic dust. The Klingon ship will be here in less than eleven minutes. They're pursuing. Ten thousand metres. We're approaching a large fragment, six hundredmetres in diameter, bearing two two seven mark four. The Vulcan High Command will continue to lobby for the Captain'srelease. The Klingons have only allowed us to remain here during thetrial. We're to leave immediately. We don't have a choice. It's quite inhospitable. We're deep inside Klingon territory. A rescue attempt is out ofthe question. The Captain isn't. He made it clear he didn't want us toendanger the crew on his behalf. I'm saying a rescue isn't an option, but there are diplomaticchannels. Not all of them. I've dealt with several Klingon bureaucrats inthe past. Some of them can be persuaded. Mister Mayweather, take us outof orbit."

She sends her regards, and she wanted me to assure you thatStarfleet, and the Vulcan High Command are doing everything possible toget you released. Not yet, but she and Commander Tucker have begun exploring otheroptions for regaining your freedom. I'll let them know. How are your accommodations? It may not appear appetising, but it seems like a good source ofprotein. I suggest you eat it. I don't believe so. I'd like to run some more tests. I'm sure I'll see you soon.

A group of rebels had fled the Klingon Protectorate atRaatooras. I was commanded to bring these traitors to justice. We'dfollowed their warp trail to a system just outside Klingon territory. Show me. What kind of ship is that? Armaments. Intercept. Viewer. Identify yourself. The people aboard your ship are wanted for treason. Surrenderthem immediately. The Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. Give them to me now, or I'll destroy your vessel. Yes. I pitied him. He was about to die in defence of these wretchedtraitors. I showed him more patience than he deserved, but obviously hewanted blood to be spilt. Don't be a fool. Your ship is inferior. You won't survive a battle withus. Return fire! The coward thinks he can hide. Pursue them! Where are they? Answer me! There. Target their engines! All weapons! Manual targeting! Fire! Follow them! It took us three hours to repair our warp drive. Identify yourself. You're harbouring fugitives. Surrender them. They're wanted for inciting rebellion. Turn over the rebels, now! That's none of your concern. I speak for the Empire."
2237,ENT,episode 43,MAGISTRATE,"Bring in the prisoner. You stand accused of conspiring against the Klingon Empire. How do you respond? When this tribunal convenes tomorrow, you will be given achance to prove your innocence. If you cannot, there is only onepunishment. This tribunal is convened. Strength to the Empire. Prosecutor Orak, you may proceed. Advocate, haven't you informed the prisoner of the rules ofthis tribunal? Do you have any further evidence to present? Do you have a response? Then I will consider the evidence and deliver my verdict. You have been warned. Be silent! This tribunal is in recess. Strength to the Empire. Have you informed the accused ofour offer? And does he wish to address this tribunal? Call your witness. Prosecutor, you will show the Advocate the same respect hehas shown you. Continue. I will hear what the accused has to say. I have weighed the evidence carefully. Advocate Kolos hasmade an impressive case, much to the surprise of this tribunal. Basedupon his arguments I am inclined to believe that the accused was avictim of his own foolishness. He was not fomenting rebellion. But, asProsecutor Orak has made clear, the laws of the Empire have beenviolated and Captain Archer must be held accountable for his actionsregardless of his intent. I therefore find the accused guilty ascharged. However! However thistribunal cannot ignore his actions assisting the Klingon people. Therefore the sentence of death is commuted. Silence! Jonathan Archer,you are condemned to the dilithium mines on the penal colony of RuraPente for the remainder of your life. Remove the prisoner. I wouldn't protest too loudly, Prosecutor. You've won yourcase. This court has shown you a great deal of patience,Advocate. Don't test my limits any further. Watch your words. You insult the honour of this tribunal. Enough! You are in contempt of this tribunal. Since you have suchadmiration for the prisoner, you will join him on Rura Pente for aperiod of one year. Remove them both."
2238,ENT,episode 43,KOLOS,"Is he infectious? Then return to your ship. You're not here to treat him. I'm Kolos, your advocate. The tribunal's about to begin. I'm familiar with the charges. Now that you've been charged, the evidence against you will bepresented. I will conduct your defence. I know what happened. You mustn't speak during the tribunal. I'll speak for you. Enemy. There is no jury. Prosecutor Orak. His success is well known. I've performed my duty. It's not important. My apologies, Magistrate. Be silent, or you will be removed. He'd say nothing that would help you. No, Magistrate. Targ. I told you to remain silent. You should have listened to me. My strategy may yet spare your life. I've spoken with theMagistrate. He's willing to show you mercy if you co-operate. Tell him where to find the rebels. It doesn't matter what you believe. They're subject to the lawsof the Empire. There's nothing you can say that will change that. Where did you take them? Another ship? A planet? Do youunderstand what will happen if you don't tell them? I'm offering you a way to save your life. They would be charged with treason. Only a fool would sacrifice himself for people he barely knows. Don't be so quick to accuse me of sharing their interpretationof the law. I became an Advocate many years ago. They were different times. The courts were more willing to listen. I'm an old man. Too old to challenge the rules. I'm not afraid. I have. He does. He wishes to testify in his own defence. With respect, Magistrate, no verdict has been reached. I am within my rights to present further testimony. Surely I don't need to remind the Magistrate, the judicialcharter of Koloth states an advocate is entitled to challenge thecharges at any point during the tribunal. To my knowledge, that charterhas not been cast aside. From the time of Kahless, our courts havestood as a forum where justice is dispensed with honour. Now, will mycase be heard, or will it not? Identify yourself. Will my client be allowed to testify, or not? Recount for this tribunal your recollection of the events. You knew they were fleeing the Empire. And you chose to show them compassion. And Prosecutor Orak has yet to prove that he has. Continue. As any good Klingon Commander would be. I was assured the accused would be allowed to speak withoutinterruption. You say the Bortas fired first. And you tried to reach an accommodation with Captain Duras? So you were simply defending your ship when you attacked theBortas? And then what happened? You could have destroyed the Bortas. Why didn't you? Not your enemy. I submit to this tribunal that Captain Archer isguilty. Guilty of meddling in Klingon affairs on more than oneoccasion. In fact, I've discovered his name is well known to the HighCouncil. The accused once stood before the Chancellor himself andexposed a Suliban plot that would have thrown the Empire into civilwar. The facts are on record. Perhaps the Prosecutor has growncomplacent with his research. The records of the Imperial Fleet alsomention this man. His ship was instrumental in the rescue of theKlingon Raptor, the Somraw, from the dense atmosphere of a gas giant. It has everything to do with this case. It shows a pattern inArcher's behaviour that was repeated in his encounter with CaptainDuras. Yes, he may be self-righteous, but his meddling has saved aKlingon ship and perhaps the fate of the Empire itself. If CaptainArcher is guilty, he is guilty of nothing more than being a nuisance,and hardly worth the attention of this tribunal. And if he must bepunished, let the punishment fit that crime. It usually doesn't take long at all. I must have been morepersuasive than I thought. Don't thank me yet. The odds are still very much against us. Bloodwine. It should help make the wait more pleasant. Don't feel badly if you can't stomach it. Oh, I'm not sure. Over two hundred. But that was a long timeago, when the tribunal was a forum for the truth and not a tool for thewarrior class. You didn't believe all Klingons were soldiers? My father was a teacher. My mother, a biologist at theuniversity. They encouraged me to take up the law. Now all young peoplewant to do is take up weapons as soon as they can hold them. They'retold there's honour in victory, any victory. What honour is there in avictory over a weaker opponent? Had Duras destroyed that ship he wouldhave been lauded as a hero of the Empire for murdering helplessrefugees. We were a great society not so long ago, when honour wasearned through integrity and acts of true courage, not senselessbloodshed. What changed? The sentence is death. You condemn this man to Rura Pente. Whatis the life expectancy of a prisoner there? Six months, a year at themost? And you expect us to believe that this is an act of mercy. I ask for no special treatment. Only that my client be judgedfairly, as any Klingon would be judged. But it has been many yearssince anyone stood in this chamber and received justice. Honour? You acknowledged that Captain Archer acted withconviction and integrity, and how do you reward him? With this grandpublic display of compassion before sending him to his death in afrozen cave. Forgive me if I fail to see the honour in that. Perhaps I spent too much time in the law library and not enoughin the battlefield. You're a fool. Haven't you learned your lesson? This is why you were sent herein the first place. For interfering in affairs that have nothing to dowith you. So, are all humans like this? Stupid. Stand up. We have work to do, unless you want to sleep on thesurface. Prosecutor Orak has been busy. Stay away from us. We have nothing you want. I can't go with you. I've been an advocate for fifty years, and I spent the lasttwenty of them standing in that tribunal playing my part, holding mytongue, and all the while honourable men were being sent to places likethis without the benefit of a defence. And then I was assigned yourcase. You told me that on your world a few courageous people made adifference. I'm not sure I have the courage, but I know I'll never beable to restore honour to my people living as a fugitive. Most prisoners here have very little to live for. Go. Go!"
2239,ENT,episode 43,OFFICER,"They're near the fifth planet. Another vesselis docked with them. Unknown, but they've taken the rebels aboard. Torpedo launchers fore and aft. Low-yield particle cannons. Wecan defeat them easily. They're signalling us. They're heading for the ring system. Debris is interfering with sensors. We've lost sensors. Shields are down! They're leaving orbit. Our engines are down."
2240,ENT,episode 43,ORAK,"I call Duras, son of Toral. Captain Duras, tellthe tribunal about your encounter with the accused. Explain. The Duras I called to testify is Commander of the battle cruiserBortas. A distinguished Klingon warrior, stripped of his command. Did theaccused have anything to do with your disgrace? Go on, Weapons Officer Duras. He refused to surrender the rebels. And how did you respond to Archer's defiance? Continue. But of course, by that time, they were gone. You're fortunateyour First Officer didn't kill you for such a failure. You'redismissed. No, Magistrate. Duras' testimony is clear. He was attempting tocarry out his mission to bring enemies of the Empire to justice. Butthis aggressor, this human, conspired with them to disgrace a proudwarrior and foment rebellion. There can be no doubt that he is ourenemy as well. Captain Archer claims to be innocent. Innocent of what? This tribunal has already been far too lenient. We haven't accused hiscrew, or his government. He's fortunate we haven't dispatched a fleetof warships to his homeworld, but we do demand that he be heldresponsible for the crimes he has committed. We demand that he receivethe most severe punishment our laws decree! I object. The time for testimony is over. Irrelevant! I urge you to end these proceedings. You're speaking of archaic rights. Do you admit, Captain Archer, that you gave aid and comfort to avessel fleeing the Empire? Their health isn't at issue here. You helped them to escape! They were subjects of the Empire. Their welfare was not yourconcern. You see the contempt these humans have for us. He still believeshe did nothing wrong. He aided these rebels, and now he refuses to help us bring themto justice! So, you were preparing for battle. The accused has already admitted that he knew the rebels weresubjects of the Empire. And he knew the Bortas was coming to retrieve them, yet helaunched a deliberate attack against an Imperial vessel. This human isguilty of more than inciting rebellion, he has committed an act of war! So, you've laid a trap for the Bortas. Such a noble human. By all means. I find his version of events extremelyentertaining. Duras was under no obligation to accommodate this human. That is absurd. Even if this is true, it has nothing to do with this case. I protest. And I compliment the magistrate on his just ruling. But thesentence for these crimes must be death."

Several, actually. Please. What's on your mind? Of course. I think we can manage without you for a few days. Your folks'll be surprised to see you. Nothing serious, I hope. I thought you told me your mother was the chief engineer. I guess they have to wear a lot of hats to keep those old shipsrunning. There was a time when I gave serious thought to serving on acargo ship. It was a few years before Starfleet was chartered. Long story. I'll tell you the next time we have breakfast. After we dock, I'll have Phlox go over with you, have him take a lookat your father. Mind if I join you? I haven't been up here since we launched. Come here a lot? Commander Tucker told me what happened. I'm sorry. The civilian channels can be pretty slow. I'm sure it wasn't easy for him when you left, but I know for afact that he was proud of you. Did he ever tell you about the letter he sent me? It was almosttwo and a half years ago. There were a few candidates I was looking atfor helm officer. I was having a little trouble deciding, so Icontacted their former COs hoping for a more personal evaluation. He wrote the shortest recommendation. Just one sentence. Hesaid he'd never met a more natural stick and rudder man in his life andI'd be a fool if I didn't choose you. When I saw how you handledyourself at the helm, I knew he was right. How long until the show begins? Get started. I'd like to share our pictures with Starfleet,give Admiral Forrest a front-row seat. Wouldn't miss it. Might be a good idea for you to go, too. It might be fun, and alittle fraternising couldn't hurt. It's a communal experience. Tell you what, let's make a nightof it. Dinner in the Captain's Mess eighteen hundred, movie at nineteenthirty. You'll be my date. I'll be a perfect gentleman. And if you don't like the movie,I'll never ask you to sit through another one. What are you doing? I thought you were going to give this a chance. F They try and scare you to see how well you suppress youremotions. Gets the heart pumping. You never did give us your opinion of the movie. I don't recall anyone greeting a Vulcan ambassador with torchesand pitchforks. They didn't know what to expect. Maybe inviting her to movie night wasn't such a great idea. Go ahead. Take us up another five thousand kilometres. I thought it was uninhabited. See what you can learn about them. Welcome back. How's your family? We spotted some damage on their port cargo modules.

You should have plenty of time to practice your harmonica. I have no interest in horror movies. I was hoping for something more serious. I've been coerced into watching tonight's movie. Don't be surprised if you see me here again afterwards. I havelittle doubt my headache will return. I've deployed the imaging relays. Approximately thirty hours. The holometric camera still need tobe calibrated. If the sensors are calibrated by then. According to the database, Frankenstein is also a work ofliterature. Perhaps a dramatic reading would be more illuminating. They'd be more likely to appreciate the author's true intent. I don't understand how sitting silently in a darkened roomconstitutes fraternising. I beg your pardon? I'm reviewing this morning's sensor data. We can stop the film if it's disturbing yourconversation. F There is something similar. a discipline known as tarul-etek. Ituses disturbing imagery to provoke an emotional response. I don't understand why humans would feel compelled to frightenthemselves. Cardiovascular activity would be more efficient. There were many medical inaccuracies. I thought the protagonist was interesting. No, his creation. From my perspective, this was the story of anindividual persecuted by humans because he was different. In many ways, the film seemed quite prophetic. The reaction ofthe villagers, for example. It was similar to the reception Vulcansreceived after landing on Earth. Nevertheless, many humans reacted with fear and anger. I'm going to recommend that Ambassador Soval watch the film. I believe it would help Vulcans who've recently arrived onEarth. On the contrary. I'm looking forward to Bride of Frankenstein. Captain. I'm reading biosigns on the planet. To quote DoctorFrankenstein, it's alive. It appears that several microbial species which live undergroundare being unearthed by the volcanic activity."
2255,ENT,episode 44,TUCKER,"Some geologic fireworks. Could be fun. You'll be glad to hear the thermal scanners are up and running. Yep. We'll drop six of them in high orbit.

Just a quick tour of the engine room. That's all I'm asking. Zephram Cochrane designed that engine himself. I've heardrumours that he personally signed the inside of each reactor casing. Oh, almost forgot. A few family photos. I downloaded every picture I've takensince we left Spacedock. Thought your mom might like to see what herboy's been up to. You bet. I can help with that. So, you coming tonight? Well, you'd better make up your mind. Seats are going to fillup fast. Mary Shelley wrote it, the wife of a famous poet. You expect a Mess hall full of crewmen to sit still whilesomeone reads to them? You want to start a book club, go right ahead. You're going tobe there tonight, aren't you, sir? I'll save you some popcorn. Really. I find it hard to believe that no one on Vulcan's ever heard of ahorror movie. What did you think of the story? Doctor Frankenstein.

This system's almost thirty light years behind us. Aye, sir. Do you have a minute, sir? I was wondering if I could make a personal request. My family's ship, the Horizon, we're going to be passing closeto it. I wouldn't mind going by for a visit. It's about ten hours offour flight path. Enterprise can still get to the planet with time tospare. You could pick me up on the way back. Thank you, sir. My father's been ill for a few months. My mother said he'll be fine. She's the ship's medic. She's both. My grandfather held the record. Five jobs at one time, two ofthem on the bridge. You, sir? Why didn't you sign up? I'd appreciate that, sir. Starfleet really ought to think about putting families onstarships. No one would ever get homesick. On a cargo ship, you can't walk ten metres without running intoyour baby-sitter or a great-aunt. Go ahead. Thanks, Hoshi. Put it through to my quarters. Captain's personal log, January 10, 2153. We're on course for ourrendezvous with the Horizon. Unfortunately, I've just received wordthat Ensign Mayweather's family is facing an unexpected tragedy. Of course not. Every now and then. My mother sent a message to Starfleet six weeks ago, but Inever got it. I should have called him. We were in comm. range a few monthsago. I guess I wasn't ready to talk to him yet. He wasn't very happywith me when I joined Starfleet. He'd been grooming me for his jobsince I was kid. With all respect, sir, I'm not so sure he was. What did he say? I wish he would have told me that. The Horizon's fifty years old. I'm sure you've seen far moreimpressive warp reactors. What's this? Thank you, sir. I wouldn't call it a dangerous mission. We've gotten into a fewskirmishes, but nothing we couldn't handle. We ran into a small wavefront a few months ago. The crew had tosqueeze into one of the nacelles for a couple of days. She probablymade it sound worse than it was. It was really just a misunderstanding. They thought Enterprisehad been abandoned. Captain Archer convinced them to leave. How'd you know about that? Charlie must be at the helm. His warp jumps were always a little rough. Where are we headed? Hey! Do you always have to bring that up? I will. Guest quarters are over here. I thought my room had been reassigned. I can't believe you kept this. I've still got a ways to go. Me, too. We're going to get through this, Mom. Are you sure you're old enough to drive that thing? Acting captain. Don't let it go to your head. The jacket looks good on you. Business must be good. I've never seen this module so full. If you need me to help out with anything. See you at dinner? All right, try it now. I've increased the range of thenavigation sensors. The helm will make course corrections a lotquicker. I'm just working on a few upgrades. You were busy. I didn't want to bother you. You're going tolove this. You know those port stabilisers that were always acting up? Before I left, I spoke with Commander Tucker. Our Chief Engineer, on Enterprise. He showed me how toreconfigure the spatial discriminators. Shouldn't give you any moretrouble. Whatever you say, sir. Come in. Word travels fast. Thanks. I don't know. I thought it might be fun to regress for a while. What do you say we turn off the grav-plating and jump on the bed? Keeps us busy. We've gone a hundred and fifty light years, seentwenty two inhabited worlds. You can't believe what's out there. Just a few days. I'm afraid not. I doubt Magellan got much time off, either. What's wrong? What do you mean? He's always on edge. My mother hasn't mentioned any of this. He's only been in command a few weeks. Give him a chance. He'llgrow into it. Thanks. Charlie at the helm? That's no turbulence. What's going on? By who? You're hauling thirty thousand metric tons. You're not going tobe able to outrun them. They're still closing. They attached something to the hull. I wouldn't recommend that. This is a dicobalt signature, ahigh-yield explosive. If anyone gets too close, it might decide to gooff. What kind of weapons does the Constellation have? What happens if they come back before we arrive? I've seen this kind of engine configuration before. It's not thatdifferent from a Mazarite ship. We had some trouble with them. We managed to knock out theirengines with our phase cannons. I can tie the plasma turrets directly into the impulse engines. Lieutenant Reed did that and it increased our yield by eighty percent. If there's one thing I've learned from Captain Archer, it'sthat you don't give in to people like this. You're only going toencourage more attacks, not just against you, but other cargo ships. If those aliens come back, you'll thank me. You may not have a choice. Paul. I didn't mean to undermine your authority. But you're being unreasonable. I just want us to be prepared. It's still my home. Is that what this is about? Me leaving? If you want to be aneffective captain, you've got to set your personal feelings aside,listen to what other people have to say. No, your father. He said that to me a long time ago. If he washere now, he'd tell you the same thing. That isn't fair. You want to stand around feeling sorry for yourself, go ahead. I've got better things to do. I'm just trying to help you, Paul. In case you haven't noticed,you could use a little help right now. You want to take them offline? Do it yourself.Â  I knew how Paul would react. I didn't want to drag you into it. Never thought I'd actually miss these. Not just any Nutri-pak, strawberry shortcake. The first time Itasted real shortcake was in San Francisco. It just wasn't the same. I wouldn't mind eating like this again. I'm thinking aboutasking for an extended leave. I'm sure Captain Archer would approve,considering. As long as I'm needed. I'm not the only helm officer. There's a lot for me to do here. I can help upgrade theguidance and warp systems. With a little luck, we could make Horizonthe fastest J-class in the fleet. My career's the last thing on my mind right now. He's not ready, Mum. You don't think I should stay. A lot has changed in four years, Mum. I'll try to keep that in mind. Good night. They're charging weapons. If I can get a clear shot, but I can't do that as long asthey're behind us. It's going to be tough to manoeuvre with thirty kilotons ofcargo. We've got to cut it loose. I'm sure it'll come back to me. They're closing. Forty metres, thirty. Ten metres. I'm coming around again. Aye, Captain. Come in. Wouldn't want to wear out my welcome. If you like, I'll speak with Lieutenant Reed. I'm sure he canhelp you remove that alien beacon. What? We haven't travelled quite that far. You can count on it. Maybe sooner. Thank you, sir. They're okay. Probably an old meteorite impact. Never better, sir. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

2433,ENT,episode 44,RIANNA,"I got a letter from your sister. She said you mentioned a closecall with some kind of storm. She also mentioned something about alien soldiers forcing theirway aboard. I guess there's no point in asking you about the Romulanminefield. I've been serving on cargo ships for a long time. I've made afew contacts here and there. What makes you say that? Deneva station. Just a quick run to pick up supplies. We'llhave you back in plenty of time. Did you forget your way? You're not assigned to guest quarters. It was, but they didn't mind giving it up for a few days. Wedon't get VIPs very often. I found some of your old things. Thought youmight feel more at home. You stayed up all night for a month, mapping every system youplanned to visit when you grew up. I'm glad you're home. Those plasma injectors aren't going to align themselves. Ishould go. After you've settled in, come by the Engine room. Somepeople want to say hello. I wouldn't risk it. If it detonates, you could lose thenacelle. I don't see why not. Mazarite? Even your father had to make compromises. Thesafest thing to do is give them what they want. Cargo can be replaced. F I understand you made a few modifications to the impulse relays. Nexttime, you might want to check with me. I am the Chief Engineer. I've played referee between you and your brother for a longtime. Nutri-paks? I think they've ruined your taste buds. How long would you stay? But you're needed on your ship. Even if your captain agrees, it could be a long time beforeEnterprise is back this way again. You're going to give up your career, move back home and takeorders from your brother? Congratulations. Now you know what it's like to be a parent. Icould spend every waking minute worrying about you two, but I'd neverget any work done. You should've seen your father when he took over. He was a yearyounger than Paul is now. He was an engineer. He didn't know the firstthing about running a Bridge. We fell so far behind schedule, he almostlost his license. He wanted to quit. I wouldn't let him. Yourbrother just needs some time. Didn't we have this conversation? It was right here in thisroom, four years ago, when you first thought about joining Starfleet. That's true, and a lot more's going to change. Will we betalking about this again in another four years? You're the helmsman ofthe first warp five starship. I'm proud of you. Everyone here is. EvenPaul, though he won't admit it. If you'll indulge a little motherlyadvice, don't let your guilt over leaving guide your decision. Night. Engineering, stand by to release the primary clamps. Just a few more clamps. Starboard plating's down. Hull plating's gone."
2434,ENT,episode 44,PAUL,"Transfer these canisters over to Module Four. An ensign ought to salute before addressing a captain. I'll catch up with you in a few minutes. Thanks. Didn't think I'd be wearing it this soon. The biggest problem these days is keeping track of everything. Dad kept a lot of the inventory in his head. I'm trying to reconstructthe database. We still can't find the stromatopod larvae we're supposedto be delivering to the Demerians. I only hope they didn't end up incold storage. Thanks, but we can handle it. You're on leave. I'm not going toput you to work. Travis. You might want to change into something a little lessconspicuous. What's wrong? I don't remember asking for any upgrades. Commander Tucker. What's going to happen if these improvements of yours go offline? You'll be back on your Starfleet ship, out of comm. range. Who's goingto fix it? I'd prefer it if you didn't modify any more systems withoutdiscussing it with me. Maybe you can stop by Engineering, build us a warp five engine. Seal it off. Try hailing them again. We're under attack. I don't know. No. Transfer reserve power to the hull plating. We need to getout of their weapons range. Go to maximum warp. You heard me. A little more. Reduce speed to one point five. Show me. Call Engineering. Tell them to get someone out there to pry itoff. There has to be a way to remove that beacon. If we jettison a few tons of that ore, can we increase to warptwo? That should allow us to reach Deneva Station ahead of schedule. It's well-armed, we should be safe there. There's no other choice. We can't shoot our way out of this. We don't have phase cannons. I'm not going to risk all of our lives by getting into a fight wecan't win. If they reach us before we make it to Deneva, we'll givethem what they want. I appreciate the advice, but this isn't your problem. You're notpart of this crew anymore. Jettison that ore and increase our speed. Where? You have the Bridge. I thought I made myself clear. I told you, I'm not going to take this ship into battle. I didn't ask for your opinion, and I didn't approve yourmodifications. Stop what you're doing. You heard me. Really. Us? You keep talking as if you're a part of this crew. You turned your back on us a long time ago. More words of wisdom from Starfleet? You quoting Dad? You never listened to him. If you had, youwouldn't have abandoned your family. You barely spoke to him for thelast four years. You weren't even here when he died. You knew he was sick, but you didn't really care. You onlydecided to stop by because it was convenient for you. Hostile aliensaren't our problem, it's Starfleet and people like you. Do you have anyidea how hard it is to find new crewmen? No one wants to run freightanymore. They all want to be explorers cruising around on state of theart ships with their personal chefs. Take those upgrades offline. I'll confine you to quarters if Ihave to. I don't want your help. Full power to the hull plating. This is Captain Mayweather of the Horizon. I'll give you our cargo, but not our ship. We're dozens of light years from our homeworld. There has to besome compromise we can Bring the weapon upgrades online. Still think you can disabletheir engines? You do remember how to fly this ship. Take us out of warp. Release the clamps. Travis. Keep our turrets locked on them. Open a channel. This is CaptainMayweather. I'd think twice before attacking any of our ships again. Re-dock with the cargo section, then get us out of here. All packed? I got a message from Enterprise. They're running ahead ofschedule. We'll be docking in about twenty minutes. Thanks. So, did you ever make it to Trelkis Three? Trelkis Three, the planet with the multi-centric rings. You usedto talk about it when we were growing up. When you do, how about sending me a subspace postcard. Well, I'd better get back to the Bridge. See you in another fouryears? I'd like that."
2435,ENT,episode 44,NORA,"I heard we had a visitor. I still can't believe he's gone. I'm so sorry, Travis. Aren't you a little old for this? And get grounded again? That wouldn't look too good on yourStarfleet record. How's Enterprise? In eighteen months? Columbus, Magellan, Travis Mayweather. How long are you home for? Any chance of getting an extended leave? I don't mean to spoil your visit, but things haven't exactly beenrunning like clockwork since your father died. We missed a rendezvous with an Orion freighter two weeks ago. TheCargo Authority wasn't too pleased. We're also low on deuterium. We'vehad to dip into the reserves twice this month. Morale's been better,Travis. Horizon's lost its captain, and some of the crew are startingto wonder if Paul's ready for the job. You might have noticed he's beena little on edge. More than usual. I guess she didn't want to worry you. I hope you're right. I'm sure this is the last thing you wantedto hear right now, but I thought you should know. Just a little spatial turbulence. You've gotten spoiled onEnterprise."
2436,ENT,episode 44,JUAN,"Hull fracture in Module three. We're venting atmosphere. They're still not responding. Should I arm the plasma turrets? Yes, sir. Warp one point six, one point seven, warp one pointeight One point eight five. They're moving off. It's emitting a subspace signal. Could be some kind of beacon. The Constellation sent us this. This ship attacked them eightweeks ago and it planted a beacon on their hull. A day later, thiscruiser showed up and demanded their cargo. The Constellation tried todrive them off, but the aliens got aboard and killed three of theircrew. Then they took the entire shipment. Two plasma turrets, same as us. Captain? Looks like someone's rerouting the impulse relays. Module five. We're being hailed. They've hit Module five. Their weapons are going down."

2441,ENT,episode 45,ARCHER,"They've been underground for six months. The Denobulan ScienceAcademy lost contact with them three weeks ago. The planet's calledXantoras. The government's been politically unstable for several years. In the last few weeks a militant faction has taken control. They can't get here in time. Enterprise is less than a dayaway. We've been asked to pick them up. First we have to find them. You've had some caving experience. What about you and Malcolm? Get some gear together. Happy to help, Doctor. I just spoke to the Xantoras Regional Governor. He'sissued a general order. You have to get them out of there in threedays. The military's preparing search patrols to arrest any strayoff-worlders when the deadline arrives. If you haven't found them in aday and a half, I want you to turn around and head back. What's the problem? Can you put it on speaker? Where are they? Set a course. Open a channel. I want to speak to their Captain. How's it going? What are his chances? You're on my ship, Enterprise. I'm Captain Archer. There was an accident on your transport. He's our doctor. You need his help. Recently? And there's still bad blood between you? If you explain to him that he won't survive without your help,maybe he'd set the past aside for a few hours. You could always sedate him and perform the treatment. Even if he wishes to die? Don't you believe if you can help someone your ethically boundto do so? This is an Earth ship, Doctor. I won't let that man die in mySickbay if it can be prevented. I'm giving you an order. How are you feeling? Your ship was damaged by the reactor leak. It'll be a few daysbefore you can go back aboard. You were exposed to high levels ofradiation. You need treatment. If you don't let Phlox operate, you won't survive more than twodays. I understand there's a troubled history between your peoples, butI can assure you Phlox is an excellent doctor. He wasn't that specific. Do you want to become a casualty of a war that ended threehundred years ago? Phlox has been my Chief Medical Officer for nearlytwo years. I've never questioned his skill or his integrity. You'd rather die? If you spent some time with him, it might change yourperception of them. I prefer to make my judgments based on firsthand experience. Irespect your history and the sacrifice your people made, but I can tellyou that the Denobulans you're describing are not the people I've met. Don't sacrifice your life based on preconceptions. Why haven't you ever mentioned this? It wasn't our proudest moment, but we've done our best to put itbehind us. Do you know you're the first Denobulan he's ever met? Doesn't that seem odd to you? That in three hundred yearsneither side has tried to reconcile. Maybe you put it behind you tooquickly. This is your chance to prove them wrong. Set aside your preconceptions. I made some headway with him,but I won't be the one holding the scalpel. Show him that he can trustyou. All I'm asking is that you try. Your ethics might keep you fromtreating him against his will, but nothing's stopping you from talkingto him. You're a doctor. He's your patient. Find a way to help him. Is that the Governor? So is mine. You did, which makes me wonder why you're attacking my people. One of your patrols has opened fire in the vicinity of thecaves. Your general order doesn't go into affect for another hour and ahalf. Then who are they shooting at? That's not my concern. You're endangering my people. You've gotto wait until they're in the clear. It's what we agreed to. Target the patrol that's firing at those caves. Charge weapons. The question is do you want to be at war with us. It soundslike you've got your hands full already. Stick to our originalagreement and you won't find yourself fighting on two fronts. Try them again. Prep Shuttlepod one. Have a security team meet me in the Launchbay. Noted. You're cutting it pretty close, Trip. The deadline passed twohours ago. The Denobulans? You've got company, Trip. Do you need assistance? How is he? I'm glad you didn't defy my orders. I wasn't looking forward tothrowing you in irons. How did you convince him? Doctor Phlox wanted to see you off, but he's busy treating one of mycrewmen who was injured on the surface. It's too bad your research on Xantoras was cut short. You do know we came here to rescue three Denobulan geologists? I understand they'll be heading home on your transport. I hopethat won't be a problem. I had a talk with them. They're willing, if you are."

You don't suppose Denobulans carry out everything they bring in? Looks like we're on the right track. They went that way. Well, look at those. If I was a geologist, that's the way I'd go. I don't have much choice. It's getting steeper. We're already behind schedule, Ensign. We can't have you slowingus down. Thanks for getting us this far. More of the same. I didn't see any other passage. Three biosigns. Denobulan. About fifty metres. The Denobulan Science Academy asked us to find you. Not quite. Your Science Academy will hold us responsible if wecome back alone. You can't stay here forever. What's the problem? Feels like weapons fire to me. Pretty high yield by the sound ofit. You mean to tell us that you climbed down that rock face withoutany ropes, any safety equipment at all? I'm fine. We need to get out of here before it starts up again. Isee them.

We're locked onto the co-ordinates. The Xantoras have mobilized their military patrols. They'lldetect a shuttle launch. Captain, there's a small craft closing on the shuttlepod. It's a patrolship."

That's not much time. No arguments here. What have you got? Make that two. The last cave I was in had handrails, a gift shop, a snack bar. Isn't there a beginners' cliff we can start on? Thanks. Just testing the rope. I think it's Denobulan. I've seencharacters like these in Phlox's medical books. Rock samples. Toss a coin? How can you tell? I can't reach it. Almost! Stand by. We'll try again. Let's swing together. You ready? Onthree. One, two, three! We're all right! Yes. You tore a couple of ligaments, too. Sorry, Travis. You're not going anywhere. You'll be all right. Give me some light on this. Can you see anything? Are you sure this is the way they came? We'll give it another half hour, then we're turning back. How far? Commander Tucker of the Starship Enterprise. This is LieutenantReed. We're not geologists. The Xantoras. They've given all the off-worlders three days toleave and that was two days ago. You don't understand. We've been ordered to take you out ofhere. We've got a lot of hard climbing ahead of us, so you'd betterdecide how much of this gear you can do without. Were not leaving without you. You don't get it. When the Xantoras get their hands on you,they'll throw you in prison. They may even execute you. I realise your work is important, but you can't risk your livesfor these rocks. How much longer do you need? Three weeks? I've spent the last two days falling down cliffsand getting stuck in lava tubes all just to find you. Now, I've got aninjured man waiting for us and we have just enough time to get out ofhere before we end up in front of a Xantoras firing squad. My ordersare to bring you back, and I promise you that's what I'm going to do. Want to bet? We didn't risk our lives to hear you say, thanks,but no thanks. So pack up whatever you need because I swear, I'll tieyou up and drag you out by your ankles if that's how you want it. Fine. Â  What's wrong? Then keep moving. I don't know. Come on. Let's go. We don't have a moment. What are you doing up there? Are thoserock samples? We can't carry any more. If you don't start moving in the next five seconds, I'm goingto take my phase pistol and shoot you in the ass. One, two. Go! Could be some kind of seismic activity. We still got two hours until the deadline. You better get your climbing gear on. Well, in that case, after you. Get against the wall! Everyone allright? Let's keep moving before we get trapped down here. Forget about them. Tucker to Enterprise. Better late than never. All aboard. Along with some very rare speleothems. Stand by.

All it's capable of doing, really, is eatingand breeding. The problem is they breed quite prodigiously. The only thing that keeps their population in check is the abundance ofreptiles on their homeworld. Are you feeling all right, Ensign? Thank you. They've mapped fifty kilometres. No one knows exactly how farthey extend. This cave system is known for its mineral formations. Thespeleothems are supposed to be particularly unusual. They're demanding that all off-worlders leave. Anyone who failsto comply could face imprisonment, or possibly worse. I realise this was an unusual request, Captain. I want to thankyou. There could be internal bleeding. Run a haemostatic scan. Treat these with dermalin gel and give himtwo cc's of anaprovaline for the pain. You're going to be fine. Get him into the Imaging Chamber. These two are doing well. His injuries were more extensive. Hisbody absorbed a heavy dose of radiation. I've stabilised him for now,but he's going to need intra-cellular regeneration. It's a complex procedure, but I'd say the odds are in hisfavour. Our two species have a complicated history. We've gone to warwith the Antarans on several occasions. On the contrary. It's been three hundred years since our lastconflict. They've been particularly bitter disputes. I seriously doubt it. He insisted I leave the room. I don'tthink you realise how much bad blood there is. I have to respect his wishes. The will of the patient is the cornerstone of Denobulan medicalethics. Hippocrates wasn't Denobulan. Without his consent, there is nothing I can do. I'm sorry, Captain, but I'm afraid I can't follow it. Do you know you're the first Denobulan he's ever met? And he is the first Antaran I've ever met. As I said before, the situation is complicated. From childhood,every Antaran is taught that Denobulans are enemies to be feared,reviled. I doubt I could. Do you believe I can earn his trust in less than thirty sixhours? Checking your biosigns. Nothing else. You're a long way from home. What brought you here? I enjoy a good challenge. You haven't answered my question. Well, I imagine the diverse population on this planet made itideal for your research. Enterprise is here to pick up three Denobulanscientists. They also found this world uniquely suited to theirfieldwork. I'm a doctor. I haven't killed anyone. I assure you, the regeneration procedure is quite safe. Ifyou'll allow me to proceed I could ask you the same question about my people. Why? My children have nothing to do with this. Enough! I have tried to treat you with respect, but I refuse to listento these insults. You're the reason we haven't been able to put thepast behind us. You have kept this hatred alive. No Denobulan wouldwant to be in the same room with you! Actually, I'm not in the mood for company, Sub-Commander. Wait. I'm sorry. Sit down. Sit. Please. Please. How are the repairs to transport coming? Dying, but that seems to be his wish. I've had patients refuse treatment before, but usually in thefinal stages of an illness. But this man seems determined to die justto prove a point. It's painful to admit, but I understand why. When Iwas quite young, I wanted to take a trip to an arboreal planet near oursystem. It was a park of sorts with a great variety of exotic animallife. Some friends and I had planned the journey for months, but theweek before I was supposed to leave one of my grandmothers took measide and told me I couldn't go. She said the planet was tainted. Antarans had lived there once. Even though they'd been gone for years, she believed the place had beenspoiled by their presence. No, but when I had children of my own I took them there. I wasdetermined not to raise them as I was raised. I certainly tried. Thanks for your company. Good night. That's your decision, but if my knowledge of Antaran lifespansis correct, your last days won't come for about sixty years. Once the intra-cellular regeneration is complete, you should beable to I need to take you off the pain medication before I begin theprocedure. I did have nightmares. You asked me if I had heard stories as a child about theAntarans. My grandmother lived through the last war. I would lay in mybed at night thinking about her stories, terrified that one of thoseevil Antarans would climb through my window. You also asked me if I have children. I have five. And no, Inever told them my grandmother's stories. When they asked me about theAntarans, I told them the truth, as best as I knew it. I told themabout our military campaigns against your people. About how we haddemonised you, turned you into a faceless enemy. I wanted them to learnto judge people for what they really are, not what the propaganda tellsthem. I don't. But I'm proud to say that my children would consider mygrandmother's attitude archaic. All of them but one. We have grown moreopen-minded since the last war, but there are still Denobulans who fearAntarans, even hate them. My youngest son, Mettus, was seduced by thosepeople. I did my best to convince him he was mistaken. I told him Iwouldn't tolerate the values he was embracing. It created a riftbetween us. Maybe I didn't do enough to reach him. Last time we spokewas nearly ten years ago. You wanted to know what my children wouldthink if they were here now. I can tell you what Mettus would think. Hewould be happy to have me grant your request and let you die. But thatis not the example I tried to set for my children. Why not live and setan example for yours? You wanted to see me? Many do. Perhaps if you met more of us. Is that all you wanted to say to me? He'll be a bit groggy when he comes out of the anesthesia, butthe procedure was successful. Neither was I. You must be familiar with the principle of doctor patientconfidentiality. Of course, you could always order me to tell you. Computer, begin recording. Dear Mettus, I know it's been timesince I've written, and I know chances are slim that you'll respond tothis letter. However, something has happened that compels me to try toreach you again. I've had an experience that has opened many oldwounds. As painful as it's been, it's also changed something in me. Ihope, if you're willing to listen, it might begin to change somethingin you. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

2639,ENT,episode 45,GOVERNOR,"Captain Archer, I thought I made myself clear. What do you mean? I assure you, they're not targeting your crewmen or theDenobulans. Soldiers from the previous regime. They've refused toaccept the shift in power. I'm afraid that's impossible. We agreed to give you three days, nothing more. If you attack us, we'll retaliate. Do you really want to be at war with us, Captain?"
2640,ENT,episode 45,TREVIX,"If the Academy knew the progress we were making,they'd never have sent you. Two weeks, maybe three. Yes."
2641,ENT,episode 45,YOLEN,"Who are you? I hope you won't think I'm rude but there are many other cavernshere to explore. Why? We're sorry you came all this way, but we're not leaving. You've warned us about the situation, Commander. You'veaccomplished your mission. All the more reason for us to stay down here where we're safe. Rocks? This is the most remarkable collection of speleothemswe've ever seen. There's calcite, aragonite, botyroidal flowstone. I'vespent fourteen years searching for tractosites this perfect. Thesesamples can provide clues to prevent seismic disasters on Denobula. You can't force us to leave. We have a lot of samples. We'll need your help. Nothing. I just need a moment. It took us six weeks to extract these from the rock bed. These are priceless. We don't have any climbing gear. Commander, the bombing seems to havestopped. My speleothems! Fortunately, I have some other samples in my case."
2642,ENT,episode 45,HUDAK,"here am I? What happened? What's he doing here? Keep him away from me. I'd rather die than be treated by him. I'd like to return to my ship. I prefer to be treated by another physician. Our history is much more than troubled. Did your doctor tell youthat their battle tactics resulted in twenty million Antarancasualties? I imagine not. They've been very successful at putting it behindthem. It's quite possible he's a proficient surgeon, but I don'tintend to find out. I'm the first Antaran to even see a Denobulan in sixgenerations. A few hours in our historical archives might change yours. What are you doing? Very diligent. What a dedicated healer you must be. Practicing your bedside manner? I'm a teacher of xenomythology. I study the legends of alienspecies. How delightful that we have so much in common. Why do you wantto save my life? Do you believe that saving one Antaran will assuage your guiltfor killing millions? Now you finally have your chance. You must know a great deal about our anatomy after what yourdoctors did to us. Tell me, were you raisedlistening to stories about my people? The evil Antarans. Did they giveyou nightmares? Do you have children, Doctor? Did you tell those stories to them? Did you teach them to hateAntarans just like you were taught? Don't they? If they were here right now, what would they thinkabout their father talking to an Antaran? Would you even let them in the same room with me? I'd prefer to spend my last few days alone. What are you talking about? I refused your treatment. Get away from me. I was told your principles prevented you fromtreating me against my will. Or don't your ethics apply to Antarans? What? I hope your confession makes you feel better, Doctor, but itdoesn't change a thing. How would you know who we really are? What you said about your son. You seem sincere in your desire toset an example for your children. I wish more Denobulans felt that way. That seems unlikely. You made me think about my own family. I have children as well. I've decided to accept your treatment. That's all right, Captain. The Doctor and I spent more thanenough time together. The time I spent on your ship was an education in itself. Thankyou for your help. Phlox told me. Have they been informed that I'll be travelling with them? And what was their response?"

2645,ENT,episode 46,ARCHER,"Too bad we won't be around. It's going to be one hell of anexplosion. No earth ship has ever been within ten light years of ahypergiant. How much farther can we move in? Then we'll have to run our scans from here. Tell Astrometricsto get going. I'm sure they're champing at the bit. You found a ship? Let's see her. Recogniseit? Hail them. Then try audio. This is Captain Archer of the starshipEnterprise. I assume you've detected us. The Sol system. And you? My species has never seen one up close. I'm afraid we haven't developed the technology to do that. Thank you. I'm not sure we have anything to offer you inreturn. It's one of ours as well. We'd be honoured to have you join usfor dinner. Tell Chef we're going to have some visitors. You must be able to get down into the photosphere of mostG-type stars. Flying into stars is a long way off for us. We have gone farther than any other humans. I am an explorer. Where'd you hear that? Absolutely, but I didn't think you'd be quoting it the nextday. And you obviously read pretty quickly. Seems like you're picking the good ones all by yourself. That'sgot to be ionised hydrogen. I've got friends back at home who are not going to believethis. Close to three days. The circumference is nearly a billionkilometres. We'll be scanning surface features that are undetectable fromhigher altitudes. I think I'll survive. These people are fascinating, T'Pol. Theyhave a lot to offer us. This could be the beginning of a beautifulrelationship. Which reminds me. They've asked us for a sampling offilms. I've put together a few suggestions. You're in charge. I'm surprised your ancestors never made it to Earth. Well, maybe now you have a reason to visit us. It's not thatfar. Fine with me. I wouldn't mind taking a turn at the helm. I've been watching you. I think I can handle it. A little. There's a pretty big flare forming below us. I thinkI can loop around it, let you get a better scan. I'll keep an eye on it. I'm starting to get the hang of this. I could take us down a littlecloser if you'd like. Aye, aye, Captain. Ten thousand metres it is. Absolutely. No problem. I don't see it. It's too big. We're not going to make it. It won't be enough. If you can't get over a wave, you got to dive through it. North shore of Oahu, body surfing. I think it's time you tookthe helm back. Archer to Enterprise. That was one hell of a ride. I'll tell you about it in a coupleof hours. We've got a lot of data to download into their computers. Where is she? Where? How long ago did this happen? Will you excuse us, Sub-commander? I might have expected something like this from a first-yearrecruit. But not you. You did exactly what I'd do? If that's true, thenI've done a pretty lousy job setting an example around here. You're asenior officer on this ship. You're privy to the moral challenges I'vehad to face. You know I've wrestled with the fine line between doingwhat I think is right and interfering with other species. So don't tellme you know what I would have done when I don't even know what I wouldhave done! Then you didn't think hard enough. We're out here to meet newspecies, not tell them what to do. Giving them books is a lot different than suggesting they defytheir culture. And they asked me for the books. Did she ask you toteach her how to read? And sneaking into her quarters, bringing her on Enterprise,lying about where you were going, why? Come with me. Just until we resolve this. It's not our place to tell you what rights you have. I'm sorry. I'm afraid it may not be that simple. On my world, when someoneasks for asylum it has to be given serious consideration. I've been told this person is just as capable of understandingas any of you are. I've been asked to give sanctuary to someone who believes she'sbeen treated unfairly. I can't ignore that. Given? You sound like you're talking about some inanimateobject. They're not forced to do anything. You can't expect me to ignore someone when they ask for myprotection. I'm afraid Shakespeare only wrote thirty six plays. So it mightbe best if you take your time memorising them. You sure you don't have an extra stratopod you could spare? Safe journey. Time to say goodbye to thehypergiant. Prepare to get underway, Travis. Go ahead. Put him through. Come in. I was just told that the Vissian cogenitor died. Suicide, Trip. She killed herself. You're damn right you are. And it's not just her. There's achild who won't be conceived because of this, at least not for a longwhile. It's time you learned to weigh the possible repercussions ofyour actions. You've always been impulsive. Maybe this will teach you alesson. Do you? I'm not so sure you do. You knew you had no businessinterfering with those people, but you just couldn't let it alone. Youthought you were doing the right thing. I might agree if this wasFlorida, or Singapore, but it's not, is it. We're in deep space and aperson is dead. A person who'd still be alive if we hadn't made FirstContact. I guess I haven't been very successful at getting through toyou. If I had, you would have thought a lot harder before doing whatyou did. Dismissed."

Maybe you should say hello. Fruit and cheese compliment each other. Actually there are hundreds, maybe thousands. They have the strongest smells of anything we have on board. Yousaid our food was aromatically bland. I thought this might change yourmind. Try some. How about this one? Stilton. Chef says it's pretty pungent. Not for a long time. I'd say that's more than alittle spicy. Alsatian Muenster. Very. There's an old Earth expression. I'll show you mine if you showme yours. Photonic? I'm not familiar with that. This technology must seem pretty antiquated to you. Is that how you see us? Quaint? Sarium micro-cells. I suppose that's very quaint, too. Maybe you'd like to see the phase-cannon assembly.

Our hull temperature is approaching eleven hundred degrees. Itwould be unsafe to get any closer. No. How long will you be gone? Three days is a long time to be confined to such a small craft,especially with a person you've just met. I'll see to it. Of the ship or the movies? Commander. He'll be gone for three days. He asked thatyou download these films and transfer them to the Vissians' database. Briefly. How interesting. A third gender. Why do you call it her? It's not our place to judge the customs of other cultures. Tri-gender reproduction is not uncommon. They're not human. Captain Archer hopes to develop a productiverelationship with this species. It might be best you kept your opinionsto yourself. I've been told you're no longer welcome aboard the Vissian ship. Why? No, you weren't. You told them you were going to theAstrometrics Lab. They tried to contact you, but you weren't there. Then they tried their mess hall. You weren't there either. Where? Why were you there? Her education is not your concern. Where else did you go? It appears you're doing everything you can to undermine theCaptain's wishes. First Contacts are important to the Captain. You may very wellhave damaged this one irreparably. Go ahead. I think it would be best if you come back immediately, sir. There's been an incident. They demanded that she be returned immediately. You shouldn't have misgivings. You've made the right choice."
2657,ENT,episode 46,TUCKER,"Can't forget Vulcan longevity, Captain. A hundred years fromnow? How old would that make you? It'll be nice to have a First Contact where no one's thinkingabout charging weapons. This is called vanilla and this is chocolate. Give it a try. Oh no, wait. You've got to eat the cherryfirst. This. Well, you just do. Exactly. This is Malcolm Reed, our Armoury officer. This is Traistana, axenobiologist, and Veylo is a tactical officer. Why don't you sit down? The Captain did ask us to mingle. See you later. I'm told you're the Chief Engineer. Thank you. Are you enjoying your food? I look forward to it. I'd also like to get a peek at yourengine room. Trip Tucker. Welcome aboard. Cogenitor? Ah. Sure thing. So, you've heard of these cogenitors. So you're saying that this man or woman or whatever, is a thirdsex? And she, it, is part of the impregnation process. I'm pretty familiar with how it works with two sexes, but What do you mean by provides? No, no, no, don't tell me. I don't think I want to know. I think I'll pass. So how long is this going to last? I mightwant to stay there for a while. That should be enough. Thanks, Doc. So you don't need magnetic confinement. Where we come from, Earth, there are only two genders. I don't mean to pry but, does every family have a cogenitor? And when they're not? Is the one I met the only one on your ship? I would. Thanks. So, does it live with you and your wife? What does it do when you're not What about school? Humans are very curious. That's impossible. A lot of things around here do, but I'm trying to keep an openmind. Captain left yet? Did you meet their Engineer? He and his wife are trying to have a baby. There was someone else with them. They called her a cogenitor. You know what that is? Well, she looks more like a her than a him. They treat her likea pet, kept in her room, not taught to read or write, no name. Porthoshas a name. We're not talking about taking your shoes off when you walkinto someone's house. This cogenitor's treated like one of Phlox'sleeches. You pull it out of its tank when you need it, then you throwit back in. That's not what I'm talking about. This is a question of humanrights. I'm not interested in discussing their habits. I'm concernedwith the way they treat this cogenitor. Yeah, well, that doesn't make it right. You scanned them when they came on board. Don't you always dothat? Is there anything you can tell me about the mental capacity ofthis cogenitor? Is it any different than the males and females? Is that something I could do? Just curious. The efficiency is up over thirtypercent. Pretty impressive. We'd be very grateful. We don't have any married couples onEnterprise. Do they give you special quarters? I wish ours was. I've got a room not half the size of this one. I'd love to get a look at your quarters sometime. If I could describeit to Captain Archer, he might consider expanding my living space. Are you telling me you have a dining room? It's pretty mild, considering the smell. This must have taken you all day. Will your cogenitor be joining us? Oh, so in our mess hall Too bad. I was hoping to say hello. Which one's the cogenitor? So, by rotating the quantum inverters, you've tripled the antimatterflux? I haven't eaten anything since this morning. If you don't mind,I'll go to your mess hall, see what they're serving. I'll be all right. I'm sure I can find the way. See you in alittle while? I came to see you. I brought you this. It'll teach you how to read. Now you try it. You just touch the word, then you'll hear it pronounced. Goahead, try it. That's right. Now go to the next one. Good. Again. Who told you that? You're as capable as they are. As smart as they are. It's not a question of what they need. You have the samerights, to learn, to choose how you're going to live, to have a name. When Calla gives birth, who's going to raise the baby? Who'sgoing to take care of it? Why? You're just as crucial in creating the child as they are. Okay, maybe. But we took scans. My doctor says you have thesame potential as they do. The only thing that sets you apart is yourgender. You're no more different than they are from each other. Haven'tyou ever wished you could read? It won't hurt you, you know. There'snothing to be afraid of. Amazing. I don't mean the mountains, I mean your reading. Look how much you've accomplished in a single day. Andreading's just the tip of the iceberg. You could study all sorts ofthings. History, science. Engineering's not bad. You don't have to sitin this room all day. Then you've got to convince them. It's not just learning. It'sexperiencing things. Music, swimming in the ocean. You do have oceanson your planet? And how about those Didiron Mountains? Reading about them isone thing, climbing them is another. There you go. That's the right attitude. You keep at it. I'vegot to get back. They think I'm at the Astrometrics lab. But I'll seeyou as soon as I can. Yeah? Actually, my name's Charles. I'm flattered. Punished? No, but they might get a little angry. Maybe I should take you back. Okay. We'll just have to be sure no one spots us. This is our transporter. It turns things into a matter streamthat can be sent just about anywhere, within two thousand kilometres orso. Then it gets reassembled. I don't see why not. I don't think that would be a good idea. Sure. Follow me. Coast is clear. That's our main engine. Fastest one inStarfleet. I've had it up to warp five point one. Your ship has an engine that's a lot more sophisticated thanthis one. No. My quarters are on B deck. Have you ever seen a movie? It's not easy picking a movie for somebody who's never seen onebefore. What would you think about a Western? No, not a Western. Idon't think a musical would be right, either. Got it. The Day the EarthStood Still. Nothing like a little science fiction to break you in. Yeah, but it's fiction. The Earth never really stood still. Sitdown. You're going to love this. Well, before we made first contact with the Vulcans, the peopleof Earth were pretty violent. They had a hard time trusting things theydidn't understand. The characters in the film knew nothing aboutKlaatu. Who he was, where he came from. So, they tried to kill him. No one's beaten me at this in the last two years. It's getting late. We'd better get you back before they realiseyou're gone. I wasn't exactly where I was supposed to be. I was with the cogenitor. At first, in her quarters. Actually, they're not her quarters. They belong to the Chief Engineer and his wife. She gets a room tosleep in, and if she's real good she can use their living space. I'm teaching her how to read. What education? I brought her here, gave her a little tour, showed her a movie. One day, that's all it took her. In one day she was reading ageography text. You're not listening to a word I'm saying. I didn't see you. How you doing? You all right? Don't worry, they will. Give it time. It's not exactly a she, sir. In my quarters. Last night after supper. I did exactly what you'd do, Captain. It's not like I had muchchoice. I wasn't going to just I didn't think it would hurt to teach her how to read. Teaching her to read is no different than you giving them booksor movies. No, sir. Come in. You wanted to see me, Captain? What? How? That can't be. Why? It's my fault. I'm responsible. I understand. You're not responsible.

That's exactly what I'm saying. Precisely. Multi-gendered techniques aren't always the same, but in thiscase I imagine the cogenitor provides an enzyme which facilitatesconception. Well, first, the female has to Oh, well. I have pictures. It should protect you from omicron radiation for about twelveyears. Keep an open mind, Commander. You came on this mission to meetother species, no matter how many genders they may have. It's good advice. Mating habits are often quite personal. Some speciesaren't comfortable discussing them. They're most likely one and the same. It's not a question of right or wrong. They weren't carrying any pathogens that would be dangerous toour crew. I'm afraid I didn't take any neural scans. Why would you want to? I suppose you could. Right here. Her synaptic density and neural mass are almostidentical to the other two. Your cogenitor appears to be no more orless intelligent than the male and female."

2847,ENT,episode 46,DRENNIK,"Captain Drennik. Where have you travelled from? We come from a system called Vissia, more than twentyfive light years from here. We saw you arrive yesterday. I assumeyou're here to study the hypergiant. It is quite a sight. Have you measured its rate ofnucleosynthesis? If you don't mind eliminating the development stage, I'dbe more than happy to help you modify your sensors. You could invite us to visit your ship. Meeting newspecies is one of our primary goals. We'll be there within the hour. I look forward to it. Trinesium can withstand temperatures up to eighteen thousanddegrees. We've been using it to construct our hulls for over a century. We can get even deeper with our stratopod. It's got twice theshielding. Your technology will evolve. What's important is that you'reexplorers. You might enjoy going even farther. I'm taking the stratopodinto the hydrogen layer tomorrow. I'd be pleased to have you join me. There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt ofin your philosophy. Hamlet, Act One, Scene Five. Your Communications Officer waskind enough to provide us with some of your literature. I assumed youapproved. We retain most of what we read. After I finished Shakespeare last night, I began reading theplays of Sophocles. What do you recommend after that? It's generating magnetic currents. I have friends who'll be equally impressed with Macbeth. We'realmost into the chromosphere. Your father. That's hard to imagine. The man who developedwarp drive on my world lived nearly a thousand years ago. We don't believe in travelling great distances. There's fartoo much to see close to home. I'm sure we can make an exception. I'm going to take us downto the edge of the photosphere. It might get a little turbulent. Our navigation controls are not like yours. They're based onfive spatial axes. You obviously have some experience. It's giving off a lot of magnetic flux. It may cause falsereadings in the navigation sensors. Another ten thousand metres and I'll be able to get a particlecount of the photosphere. Are you all right? If you can keep us at this altitude a little while longer. There's a flare forming ahead. You will. Turn the axis forty degrees to port. I think we canbank around it. Take us up. Try to get over it. Increase speed. What are you doing? Where did you learn to do that? Some men can work together for years without creating thefriendship and bond that we did in only two days. I'm certain we canresolve this. We're not on your world, and I doubt whether this person trulyunderstood what your engineer was suggesting. We're in no rush to leave. Take your time. Consider what we'vesaid. Captain Archer. By all means. I hope yesterday's unfortunateincident won't interfere with future relations between our people. I'm sure your Starfleet will develop one soonenough. Goodbye, Captain."
2848,ENT,episode 46,COGENITOR,"Hello. They're not here. Why? I don't understand. Why are you doing this? It's not right for me to read. You shouldn't be here. That's not true. They need me to have children. That may be true on your world but not on mine. They will. You don't understand. The Didiron mountain rangeruns through the upper plains of the Great Continent. The text describes far more impressive peaks. The fauna and flora vary greatly on either side of thecentral plateau. They would never let me learn those things. Yes. I'd like to climb a mountain. Trip? I'd like my name to be Trip, just like yours. Then I would like my name to be Charles. Would you be punished if they find out you've brought mehere? I would be punished. No, no, I want to see more. Could it send a Vissian? I'd like to try. Could I see where you work? I think my ship has something like this, but I've never seenit. Do you live here? It's a story about your planet? Why were the humans so afraid of Klaatu and his android? I understand. Does this mean I've won? Tell me about Westerns. Maybe I could watch a Western next. They don't want to help me. They don't want me to climbmountains. They're angry with you. They'll leave as soon as our captainreturns. They won't help me, but you can. I want to stay here, please. You don't understand. I can't go back. Trip said I have the same rights as they do. Are you going to force me to leave?"
2849,ENT,episode 46,TRAISTANA,Why?
2850,ENT,episode 46,VEYLO,"A human tradition? So cheese comes in eight varieties? What made you choose these? Mild, but very nice. The odour is a little spicier. What's it called? Haven't you ever tried it? Here. And what's this called? Interesting. Don't youfind it sensual? Can we visit the Armoury later? I'm anxious to see your tacticalarray. Are these armed with photonic warheads? I'm afraid our weapons are somewhat more sophisticated thanyours. Where I come from, antiquated can be very quaint. And charming. What sort of power source do these use? Not at all. We charge our weapons the same way. Please. Impressive. Don't be. I've wanted to get a little closer to you all day. I was hoping to spend some intimate time with you. Maybe wecould sleep together tonight. It's very different on Vissia. It's only when a woman enjoys herintimate time with a man that she'll join him for dinner."
2851,ENT,episode 46,CALLA,"I'm glad you invited us here. Oh, very much. It has no name. It's our cogenitor. We're hoping to have a baby. For us, the aroma is far more important than the taste. If I had all day, I would have prepared a far more scented meal. Bringing a cogenitor to your ship was an exception. Why would you want to do that? I'll see if it's awake. We're the ones being treated unfairly. Do you know how longwe've waited to be given a cogenitor?"
2852,ENT,episode 46,ENGINEER,"Commander Tucker. Lieutenant Reed pointed you out. Please,sit down. This is my wife, Calla. I hope you get the chance to sample our food. It's morefragrant than yours. By all means. Our warp core emits omicron radiation. I'd recommend youspeak with your doctor about an inoculation. The antimatter stream is compressed before the deuterium'sinjected into the core. Let me bring up the schematics. That's true of most worlds. That wouldn't be very efficient. They are only needed when acouple's trying to have a child. The cogenitor is assigned to another couple. They make upabout three percent of our population, which seems to be a perfectratio. Nature has a way of finding the right balance. The only one. Once Calla and I are finished with it, I doubtit'll be needed before we return home. Would you like to take a closerlook at the plasma converters? We keep it in our quarters, yes. It eats, sleeps. There's not much else for it to do. They only serve one purpose. Sending them to school wouldmake no sense. Why are you so curious about them? You might find this difficult to believe, but this polymer iscomposed of over two hundred naturally occurring elements. I read in your database that you've discovered only ninetytwo. I understand how this might seem unnerving. When the engine reaches critical mass, a mixture of positronsand neutrinos is injected into the chamber. Watch. It's possible this technology could be modified forEnterprise. The captain's very generous. Why don't you join us for dinner tonight? You did agree totry our food. We'll try not to prepare anything too pungent. Calla's in charge of the Microgravity Lab. We usually don'thave much time for cooking. It rarely eats more than one meal a day. Commander Tucker is very curious about our reproductiveprocess. Humans are bi-gendered. Exactly. Three more, and I'll be finished. If you wait until I'm done, I'll show you how to get there. Why are we debating this? The cogenitor belongs on our ship. Or are you suggesting my wife and I abandon our plans to have a child? You have no right to judge us. You know nothing about ourculture. What if one of your stewards, the men who are forced to serveyou food, what if they should ask us for asylum? I apologise. But it's easy to misunderstand someone when youknow nothing about their culture."

2855,ENT,episode 47,ARCHER,"The Admiral thinks that they're humanoids enhanced withtechnology. He believes they abducted the research team. Earth tracking stations spotted the transport leaving orbit atwarp three point nine. I think it's safe to assume these aliens reconfigured theengines using technology from their own ship. Not exactly, but their heading puts them within a half dozenlight years of our current position. We've been ordered to find theship. We'll start searching at these coordinates. Go to tacticalalert. Lay in a course. Hard to believe anything could survive. Go ahead. How long to reach them? Set a course. Open a channel. This is Captain Archer of the Starfleet vesselEnterprise. Stand down your attack, or we'll open fire. Any human biosigns? Can you disable their weapons? Is there anyone alive on the Tarkalean ship? Hold our position. Get a shuttlepod ready. You havethe Bridge. You said the human biosigns were erratic. Can you remove the nanoprobes? I'm not so sure. I'll haveMalcolm post a guard. Keep me updated. Come in. Any sign of the transport? There was something familiar about all this, but I couldn't putmy finger on it until I find this speech Zefram Cochrane made eightynine years ago. When I was a kid, I read everything I could about him. It took me a while, but I finally found it in the database. He wasgiving a commencement address at Princeton when he started to talkabout what really happened during First Contact. He mentioned a groupof cybernetic creatures from the future who tried to stop his firstwarp flight when he was living in Montana. He said they were defeatedby a group of humans who were also from the future. No one took him seriously, and he recanted the whole thing afew years later. But you have to admit, there are similarities. If he was right, they might be heading back to their homeworldso they can try again. Doctor? Phlox. What happened? Seal off the maintenance shafts. Post teams at every accesspoint. When you find them, put them in Decon. Maximum security. Stay here in case there are any more problems. Call the bridge if you need anything. I'll have it brought down.Â  Doesn't look like they've enhanced the aft plating yet. If wecan punch through here, we should be able to knock out this EPSmanifold, take down their main power. Go ahead. How far are they? I need you to coax a little more power out of the engines. Travis, lay in a course, warp four point nine. Let's hope they didn't have time to upgrade their weapons. Go ahead. What's in that junction? Can you stop them? Isn't there an outer hatch in that junction? Malcolm, get out of that section and seal it off. Take us out of warp. Sub-Commander. Close the hatchand re-pressurise. Malcolm, I want you to work with Trip. Find out what they were doing in there. Resume course and speed. Coffee with cream. This'll be fine. Is this seat taken? He thinks we can knock out the power systems without causingtoo much damage. That's the general idea. I want to take these people home, the humans and theTarkaleans, no matter what state they're in. Are you saying we shouldn't go after that ship? Go ahead. On my way. I'm not ready to declare them a lost cause. How are you feeling? Any progress finding a treatment? What is it? Aren't you jumping the gun a little? Increase speed. Target that manifold. Block it! They set us up. This is Captain Trip, we could use weapons. Is the transporter still on line? Then you're with me. I'm counting on you to pull us out of there. Put us as close as you can to their manifold. This was one of the researchers. Look at these biosigns. They're not human anymore. Same as the others. That's it. Â  They've adapted. Hurry, Malcolm! Archer toEnterprise. Stand by transporter. Now. Report. There isn't anyone on that ship we can help anymore. Target their warp core. Hit them with everything we've got. Get me Admiral Forrest. Captain's Starlog, March 1, 2153. Repairs to the ship are underway, andwe've resumed our previous heading at low warp. Doctor Phlox isconfident he'll make a complete recovery. Aren't you supposed to be in bed? They say doctors make the worst patients. Do you think they were trying to communicate with you? Come in. The computer analysed Phlox's numbers. They'repulsar frequencies with geometric light year measurements. They told their homeworld how to find Earth. Somewhere deep in the Delta Quadrant. Sounds to me like we've only postponed the invasion until what,the twenty fourth century? <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

2863,ENT,episode 47,REED,"We're a long way from the Arctic. What can we do? Yes. The researchers gathered a great deal of biometric data onthese aliens, but I'm having trouble making heads or tails of it. Well, this arm might contain some sort of weapon. If I candetermine its yield, we'll have a better idea of what we're facing. What sort of people would replaceperfectly good body parts with cybernetic implants? I don't have a problem with it, as long as it stays outside of myskin. That's different. Yeah, I'm sure it was. Anything? The research team was heavily armed. How did these aliens manageto overpower them? They're charging weapons. Some kind of protonburst. Those transports aren't normally armed. I believe so. Their weapons are down. Captain. They left through here. Aye, sir. Stop what you're doing! I'll fire if I have to. Isaid, step away. Maximum setting. Fall back. Reed to the Bridge. They're in maintenance shaft C. Junction twelve. They appear to be modifying systems. Our weapons were useless. They're equipped with some kind ofenergy shielding. Understood. Come on, go. We're clear, Captain. Aye, sir. What do you think they were doing here? That shielding of theirs was impressive. We might as well havebeen firing holographic bullets. There's got to be a way to get through those shields with phasepistols. If I cross-polarise the power cells, it might increase theparticle yield. I'll be in the Armoury. Increase power another five megajoules. Fire. Keep it going. Increase to seven megajoules. Try eight. Nine. The density's holding. Bring it up to ten. Thatshould do it. We'll reach that transport in less than an hour. Let'smodify as many of these as we can. They've improved their defences since we last saw them. We're losing weapons. Hull plating's down eighty one percent. Plating's down another twelve percent. For the moment. I've doubled the particle yield. It maytake a few seconds to recharge after each shot. Was? Sir. Another human? Captain! Sir, something's happening on the transport. Their systems arebeing restored. They're charging weapons."

2866,ENT,episode 47,T'POL,"It shouldn't be difficult to isolate their warp signature. Bridge to Captain Archer. We're receiving an automated distress call. It's from aTarkalean freighter. Obviously, the engines aren't the only system they've upgraded. Nine on the Arctic transport. The readings are erratic. Two biosigns on their upper deck. I'm reading minimal lifesupport. It's likely the researchers are going through a similartransformation. Perhaps you should isolate them in the Decon chamber. I've contacted Tarkalea. I told them we're doing everything wecan for their crewmen. Nothing. As I recall, Cochrane was famous for his imaginative stories. Hewas also known to be frequently intoxicated. He said their ultimate goal was to enslave the humanrace. T'Pol to Captain Archer. I've located the transport on long-range sensors. They're traveling atwarp four point eight. Less than two light years. Warp plasma regulators. It's them. Yes. The junction's empty. You had no choice. I believe Crewman Cunningham is in the galley if you'd likesomething else. Please. Lieutenant Reed informed me that you plan to disable thetransport when we find it. So you still intend to rescue the humans? If they've already been transformed, that could be difficult. There are twenty nine lifeforms on that transport. It's logicalto assume they've all been infected. We could endanger Enterprise ifthey're brought aboard. Perhaps you should reconsider. I'm saying, we destroy it. The vessel's mass has increased by three percent. They're disrupting our plasma network. Main power is failing. Captain. Alert Security. Bridge to Commander Tucker. How much longer? Evacuate that section. Acknowledged. Go ahead. Do we have weapons? Our engines and weapons are back online. The transport's beendisabled, so has the alien circuitry. Did you find the research team? You were under extraordinary physical stress. You may haveimagined it. Spatial co-ordinates. Did you learn where the message was sent? Then I doubt there's any immediate danger. It would take atleast two hundred years for a subspace message to reach the DeltaQuadrant, assuming it's received at all."
2867,ENT,episode 47,TUCKER,"That's impossible. Those transports can't exceed one pointfour. Buried in the ice for a century. Handsome devil. They've modified most of the primary systems. Engines, hullplating. These look like weapons nodes. I don't even want to guess whatthis thing's for. One or two torpedoes ought to do it. I'll give it a shot. They doubled their top speed in less than twelve hours. They did a real number on these circuits. It could take days toget all this junk out. I don't know. But they almost overloaded the plasma regulators. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Why blow up the ship if you're stillon it? Hand me that, will you? Too bad you didn't get a closer look. That kind of technologycould come in handy. Tucker to the Bridge. These cybernetic circuits just lit uplike a Christmas tree! It's going to be a few minutes. Go ahead. I think I've isolated One of the power relays. Stand by. Tucker to the Bridge. The alien circuits are losing power. They're coming online now."

If your heart was damaged, would you want me to replace it witha synthetic organ, or would you rather die? There's a species I once encountered in the Beta Magellansystem, the Bynars. When they're born, a surgeon removes the child'sparietal lobe and replaces it with a synaptic processor. I saw theprocedure performed once. It was very impressive. I don't see any evidence of a weapon. The Tarkaleans should live but the nanoprobes have infiltratedtheir autonomic systems. Their renal glands have been replaced withdevices like this. Essentially, these individuals are being transformedinto some sort of cybernetic hybrid. Not surgically. These devices are multiplying at anextraordinary rate. I could never extract them all. I'm attempting toslow their progress with a modified retrovirus, but so far I haven'tbeen very successful. If you do that, I won't be able to treat them as effectively. Idon't believe they're a danger to the crew. My name is Phlox. I'm a physician. You are aboard a starship. Weresponded to your distress call. Your vessel was attacked. I'm doing my very best to treat you. I'm going to sedate him. We were attacked. I've been infected with the nanoprobes. One of the aliensinjected me, some sort of tubules. Use extreme caution, Lieutenant. Their physical strength hasbeen enhanced. It's critical that you don't let them touch you. You haven't been infected. Actually, it's feeding time for my Edosian slugs. They're quitepartial to boiled rootleaf. I usually pick some up from the galley, butunder the circumstances. What's this? It's best if I avoid food for the time being. If I eat, my cellular metabolism will accelerate. The nanoprobescould spread further. Why are you wearing a phase pistol? I hope you'll use the stun setting. I appreciate the offer, but it may not be safe to be near meright now. The technology could assert itself at any moment. I don't knowwhat will happen if it does. I underestimated these nanoprobes once. Idon't intend to make the same mistake twice. Phlox to Captain Archer. Could you please come to Sickbay? Better than I anticipated. The nanoprobes seem to be havingtrouble with my immune system. But they're persistent little fellows. It won't be long before they adapt. Possibly. I've been attempting to treat the infection as if itwere, well, an infection. Then it suddenly occurred to me, this isn't abiological problem. I need to think like an engineer, not a physician. I extracted several of the devices and subjected them to differentforms of radiation. Their intra-molecular processors appear to bevulnerable to omicron particles. But if one of the nanoprobes survives,it will start to multiply again. So I'll need to programme a ratherexcessive dose. The side effects will not be pleasant, to say theleast. You may want to keep this in the event I'm unsuccessful. A cure of sorts. It contains a neural toxin that will terminatemy synaptic functions within a matter of seconds. I have no intention of turning into one of those cyberneticcreatures. I've programmed the irradiation sequence, but I'll need you toactivate it once the chamber's sealed. All you have to do is pressthis. I'm merely catching up on some paperwork. Nothing too strenuous, I assure you. It's vital to keep the mindoccupied during the healing process. Captain, there's something you should know. I had a ratherstrange experience while I was infected. I believe I was connected withthe aliens, possibly through some form of telepathy. Not precisely. It felt as though I was part of a groupconsciousness. It seemed quite real. I couldn't understand most of what I washearing, but I got the distinct impression they were trying to send asubspace message. They transmitted a numerical sequence. I heard itover and over again."

That's it,sir. Room service. Rootleaf lettuce for your slugs, Vulcan sandworms for the batand angel hair pasta for the ship's physician. You need to keep up your strength. Well, it's right here if you change your mind. Oh, it's Lieutenant Reed's idea. If you come near me, I'msupposed to shoot you. It's going to be a few hours before we catch up with thattransport. I'm sure that Captain Archer wouldn't mind if I stayed for alittle while, kept you company. I'm armed, remember? You've looked after me more times than Ican count. I want to return the favour. Do you mind if I feed your animals before I go? They're sending a transmission, some kind of activationsequence. I can't. They're hailing us. Audio only. We've been boarded. Six biosigns, C deck.

It's pretty sophisticated, but it doesn't compare to this. Did you run a genetic analysis? Transmit your findings to Starfleet. Maybe they'll find a matchin their database. What about this? Maybe their warp drive overloaded. Could you date them? What are they? The Denobulans have experimented with nanotechnology, but theyhave nothing like this. Couldn't the bodies be damaged if we freeze them again? Then we should leave them here. Let the regeneration processcontinue. There's no reason to assume they're hostile. Starfleet has asked us to find out everything we can. Keep themhere for now, we'll see what happens. Anything? You seem a little jumpy. I'd be more worried about the polar bears. How big? The debris field could be a lot more extensive than we thought. We might want to get another excavation team out here. What is it? Seems too small for a ship this size. Here, here.

There's a lot more here than we're seeing. We've got another one! Sir, I've run every test in the book. I still can't identifythis alloy. I thought it was simple thermal damage until I found signs ofantimatter residue. That could explain why there's not much debris. I did find somecarbon traces. This debris has been here for about a hundred years. Take a look at this. Do you see those devices? They're repairing the cell membranes. Oh! Plenty. Cybernetic corpses, digging through frozen remains in themiddle of the night, why would I be jumpy? I've identified twenty two fragments of the outer hull. Eachone has the same curvature. I think this ship was a perfect sphere. About six hundred metres in diameter. A warp signature. Help me with this. Deuterium residue. Might be some kind of warp coil.

He could probably operate it like it was his ownflesh and blood. Take a look at the eyepiece. Judging by the optics, I'd sayhe could see most of the EM spectrum. That's even more interesting. They don't have much in common. They belong to two different species. Right away. I believe you're looking at a form of nanotechnology. I foundthousands of these in both aliens. They're not just regenerating thedamaged tissue, they're repairing the mechanical components as well. Asfar as I can tell, this arm's as good as new. Maybe we should move the bodies to Module three, put themback in cold storage with the other samples. That way, we can examinethem later under controlled conditions. I guess it's possible. What if it revives more of their systems? We don't knowanything about this species or what they were doing here a hundredyears ago. They don't exactly look friendly. A little on the quiet side.

I've heard of Vulcan experiments where they were able to excitedark matter by bombarding it with metrion particles. Could you rig some kind of spatial charges? Something that would spread the metrion particles over a wider area? Get to work on these charges. This is good timing, Admiral. We just picked up some very interestingsensor readings. What are their ranges? Thanks. If this nebula exists, we don't know what effect it could haveon the shuttlepod. Not this time, Trip. All the close calls he had flying warp trials, and he getskilled climbing Mount McKinley. Thanks. We? I'd prefer to handle this myself. Go ahead and meditate. I'm fine. A Starfleet Captain. A. G. Robinson. I wouldn't be out here ifit weren't for him. I'm sure there's a paragraph about him in the Vulcan data base. We were in the NX test programme, trying to break the warp two barrier. There was just a few of us. Gardner, Duvall, AG and me. We all wantedthe first flight Sorry I'm late, Commodore. I came straightfrom the test bay. At ease, Commander. I heard your got the warp reactor up toninety percent today. Ninety two. Sir, you didn't call me here to ask about an enginetest. We all know the assignment's about to be handed out. I'm guessingthis is either really good news or AG's a fine pilot. Sounds good. You know I spent more time in the simulator thananyone. If I can do anything to help AG prepare for The most important thing to me is that we succeed. Is thereanything else? Thanks, Ruby. Sure, why? Sherlock Holmes has nothing on you. Do you remember what Buzz Aldrin said when he stepped on themoon? Nobody does, because Armstrong went first. Congratulations. Of course not. I'm waiting for Forrest to realise what ahorrible mistake he made. Until then, let me buy you a drink. To Commander A. G. Robinson. We all worked hard to get thisflight, but in the end the best pilot won. Just ask him. AG. Take it easy Commander, you're due in the simulator at oh sevenhundred. First flight's in two weeks. I bet you're going to tell me. And? That's right. Only one of us was going to get to fly that ship. Nothing wrongwith a little healthy competition. I agree. Was that a compliment? Not exactly. He was lucky to come out of it in one piece. Maintain your orbit. We're trying to run down a problem withthe stabilisation protocols. What can I get you? I'll send Ruby up to take your order. Good news AG. I just got word from the powers that be thatyou're good to go. Warp field initialisation in twenty seconds. We noticed that here. Do you want to bring her back to the garage? NX control to NX Alpha. You have my permission to go to warp. Warp one. One point five. That little bump you just felt was warp two. Congratulations. Now let's see if you can get it up to two point one. AG, we're getting some pretty unusual telemetry down here. Weneed you to go sublight until we get this sorted out. Did you hear me? Negative. Abort! Warp two point one five. Two point two. AG, you've got to get out of there. NX Control to NX Alpha, come in. AG, can you hear me? We should be entering the nebula. As Doctor Phlox would say, optimism. Time to put Trip's charges to the test. Three seconds. Anything? We need to move deeper into the nebula, if it exists. The field emissions on the charges could have been too low, ormaybe we're just on a wild goose chase. He made the record books for being the first person to deployan escape pod at warp, but he lost one of two NX prototypes. Nearlyderailed the entire programme. Are you all right? You where ordered to abort. He's right. This is a new engine. It's bound to have a few bugsto work out. We've got a lot of data to analyse before we know whathappened. We should be grateful we only lost the ship. Who's Cyrus? What's your name, Lieutenant? Trip? Thanks with your help today with our Vulcan friends, Trip. Myfather would have appreciated it. Commodore. Of course. Is there something on your mind, Sir? For how long? What do you mean, indefinitely? We have an engine that works now. If we start over, it'll bedecades before we get into deep space. I suppose you heard. Where have you been all day? You should be. The Vulcans have been leaning on Starfleet foryears to rein in this programme. You walked in there today, ruled outpilot error, and told them just what they wanted to hear. Our enginedoesn't work. I agree. We need a pilot who listens to orders. If you aborted,we'd still have a ship and probably another chance. At the first sign of trouble, you should've throttled down. I guess we'll never find out. There's nothing wrong with that ship! What the hell's that supposed to mean? Not before I got two bruised ribs and a cracked molar. It's all right. Auxiliary's kicking in. We must be getting close. Trip said the dark matter mightaffect the shuttle's systems. He'll be happy to hear he was right. I don't think so. Our pre-launch checks were all fine. Something else caused that surge. Have a little faith, T'Pol. One thing I learned from AG. You're never going to get anywherewithout taking risks. Quite a bit. Humans can have funny ways of forming friendships. He would have loved it out here. Too bad he never got thechance. God knows he earned it. He was also responsible for getting it back on course, with alittle help from me and Trip. I see you're not losing any time. I'm not clearing out just yet. I've been thinking about what you were saying last night aboutmy father's engine. You were right. I wanted to see this thing fly so badly, itkept me from being objective. It may. I got my hands on the telemetry from your flight. Itlooks like Tucker was right about the intermix, but I think we cancompensate for it. We can take this to Starfleet, make a case to get off theground again. Commodore Forrest will back us up. Even if his two senior pilots insist that this ship can fly? Ifthe three of us go in there together, we might be able to change theirminds. You just went faster than any human being ever has and now yourgoing to walk away? Let them put the ship in mothballs when we're soclose to breaking warp three? You're always talking about taking risks. What have we got to lose? I'm open to suggestions. They'll never give us clearance. We should be twenty thousand kilometres inside the nebula. Let's loadup two more charges. It wasn't the kind of thing Starfleet Command wanted toadvertise. Don't you believe me? Well, you didn't know me then. I was a little more by-the-book. We still have two more charges. Let's keep looking. Promise you won't put this into the Vulcan database? We decided on a night launch. Thanks. I'll keep an eye on it. We need you down here. Don't worry, you'll get out theresomeday. If I had my own ship I'd sign you up in a second. Thanks, Trip. No response from the auxiliary APU's. How's it coming, Trip? How long? Acknowledged. Not on your life. Anyone noticed we're gone yet? Warp field is stable. Something wrong? What? We're about to find out. Just running an engine test, sir. We see it. Warp two point one five. You'd better get thatintermix locked down because I'm not backing off till I break yourrecord. Got it? NX Beta to Commodore Forrest. You might want to check yoursensors. You'll see that we're holding steady at two point five. With all due respect, its not your's either. You're right, sir. We were reckless. We knew there'd be consequences. We knew we'dprobably be thrown out of Starfleet. AG and I may never fly again, but its a small sacrifice to makeif it keeps this project going. We didn't build this engine to maketest runs around Jupiter. We built it to explore. If my father werealive today, he'd be standing here asking, what the hell are we waitingfor? Convincing enough. We managed to avoid a court martial, butthey grounded us for three months. Eventually. The Vulcans had us run every simulation they couldthink of for over a year before they finally admitted the engine wouldprobably work. Eight months after that, Duvall broke warp three in theNX Delta. Five years later we laid the keel for Enterprise. You knowthe rest. I'd hate to see those last two charges go to waste. Anything on sensors? T'Pol, come up and look at this a minute. Let the sensors do it. That's why AG and I worked so hard toget out here. He wasn't alone, but by the end AG and I were the only twocandidates left. They made the final selection six months before welaunched. Maybe I just got lucky. Thanks. Luck had nothing to do with it. To the first skipper of the NX02. Right. You should've been there. What would you suggest? The T'Pol - Archer nebula?"

3081,ENT,episode 48,T'POL,"It could be a phantom reading, background radiation. But never in such dense concentration. Even with modified sensors there wouldn't be much to see. Those tests involved very small quantities. This structure isnearly ten million kilometres in diameter. I've brought some sensor enhancements. We'll find them useful in mapping the nebula, if it's there. This is a scientific mission. It's only logical to bring yourScience Officer. Commander Tucker obviously didn't remind you that Starfleetregulations prohibit the Captain from leaving the ship unaccompanied. We should reach the edge of the phenomenon in two hours, fortysix minutes. I can pass the time by meditating, but if you'd prefer totalk? Would you like to join me? You seem quite unsettled since yourcall from Admiral Forrest. Commander Tucker was reluctant to discuss it as well, though hedid mention an old colleague had died. I'm somewhat familiar with Starfleet history. I've never heardof a Captain Robinson. You said Captain Robinson was a close friend. From what you've told me, your relationship seemed adversarial. He did have a point. It does take more than piloting ability tocommand a starship. Fortunately, you seem to have developed the necessary skills. An observation. I assume Captain Robinson's flight wassuccessful? Particle density is increasing. The readings could be misleading. Optimism doesn't alter the law of physics. What happened? I was referring to Captain Robinson. His test flight. The fight was interrupted? I suppose we'll never know. Who would have won. Main power is fluctuating. There was a surge in the grid. It was probably nothing more than a simple malfunction. I'm not detecting any dark matter. Even if you're right, it may be dangerous to proceed. Anothersurge could disable life support. You obviously admired this man. And yet he cracked your molar. To say the least. I thought you said he was responsible for nearly ending theprogramme. The history of your early warp flights is well-documented, butI've never read anything about two Starfleet pilots stealing the warpthree prototype. I have no doubt it happened, though I find it difficult tobelieve you had to be convinced to participate. The particle density has nearly doubled. Shall we try again? Perhaps we shouldhead back. Was your test flight successful? You obviously weren't dismissed from Starfleet. They must have foundyour argument convincing. Still, the NX programme continued. The particle density has increased again. It appears so. Fascinating. This data will certainly cause a debate atthe Science Directorate. I have to monitor the quantum field. Captain Robinson clearly wanted to command Enterprise as much asyou did. Captain. We should start back if we're going to make our rendezvous. Your charges were effective. I believe there's a human custom that says when you discoversomething of merit, you earn the right to name it. I was thinking the Robinson nebula would be more appropriate. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

3082,ENT,episode 48,TUCKER,"If I can, it should put on a hell of a show. Aye, Captain. You've got six spatial charges. I rigged them myself. If there's any dark matter within five hundred kilometres,you'll know it. You sure you don't want some company? All the more reason to bring your engineer along. I still can't believe it. There's nothing wrong with that engine. Tucker, sir. I'm on Captain Jefferies' Engineering team. We'venever pumped this much antimatter through the injectors before. It'sgoing to take us a little time to get the intermix right. Just because it took you a hundred years to crack warp twodoesn't mean it'll take us that long. Sorry, sir. Cyrus. It was my great grandfather's name. Chester. How about Rosalie if it's a girl? Come on, give me ahint. She's had names for her kids picked out since she was ten. Saysshe'll marry the first man to guess them. Charles Tucker, sir, but everyone calls me Trip. My dad's Charles Tucker, and so was his dad. That makes me thethird, so triple. Trip. I don't get it. It's like they want us to fail. Can I buy you a drink, sir? I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to One beer. Permission to speak freely, sir? It's your father's engine. Hislife's work. You can't let them do this. What'd you tell them? Aren't you forgetting something? The possibility of pilot error. The engine's sound. We just need more time to balance theintermix. Come on, come on, break it up. Break it up! I've routed the intermix controls to the engineering station. If it becomes unstable, you'll be able to adjust it manually. If I came along, I could monitor the antimatter flow. You're going to have your hands full. I'm going to hold you to it. I've disabled The tracking sensors but I'll need a minute to divert the telemetry. Don't wait for me. I'll be ready by the time you break orbit. No, as far as they know the doors are closed and thelights are out. But New Berlin should be picking you up in about six minutes. Here we go again. I'm reading fluctuations in the intermix. Your warp field's destabilising. NX Beta, do you read? Welcome back. How'd it go? Was it a good show? I'll remember to ask you next time."

I'll have a beer, Mister Tucker. It's been a while since I've been in here. I see it hasn'tchanged much. I came here to tell you at the urging of the Vulcan AdvisoryCouncil, that Starfleet Command has decided to put the NX programme onhold. Indefinitely. They want to go back to the drawing board, Jon. Develop a newengine from scratch. Starfleet's made its decision. Come in. You're working late. What? Has anyone bothered to look? This is Forrest. What the hell is going on? Archer? Turn around right now, and I'll do what I can To keep you out of prison. If you Archer! Perfect. Congratulations. Now get the hell back here. Not only was it in violation of a direct order, it was utterlyreckless, irresponsible and maybe even criminal. I'm not done, Commander! You are both suspended from dutypending an inquiry, and by the time Starfleet Command gets through withyou, you're going to wish that you had never come back. You're supposedto represent the best that Starfleet has to offer. Keeping thisprogramme on track is hard enough without our own officers underminingit. What did you think that this stunt of yours would accomplish?

Youburned the midnight oil in that simulator, eighteen, twenty hour days. You shut everything and everyone out of your life just so you could bethe first. You still don't understand. Starfleet doesn't just want agreat pilot. They want a great captain. NX control. I thought we built a warp ship so we couldgo to warp. I saw Italy go by again. If this is going to take muchlonger, maybe you can send up some food. How about some of those deep fried mushrooms from the 602? Acknowledged. is nominal. APU's are good. I'm breaking orbit. At least the thrusters work. I did get alittle variance on the RCS. Not on your life. See you in a few light years. She's getting a little shaky. Are you sure you've got that stabilisation problemironed out? I'm at two point one. I think I can get more out of her. The field's collapsing! A little shaky. Trust me, you don't want to pass through thewarp barrier in one of those. Should make a nice addition to theStarfleet Museum. I'm not sure, sir. The closer I got to two point two, themore trouble I had keeping the field stable. The abort call was premature. We had some instability on theprevious tests, but it always settled down. We're not going to get anywhere without taking some risks. Bourbon, straight up. This is really going to throw a wrench in my career plans. Thanks. I'll have another. Debriefing. After the flight surgeons were done with me I gothauled in front of the Starfleet senior staff and the Vulcans. What do you think? The subspace field destabilised at warptwo point two. Primary flight controls failed, resulting in the loss ofthe vehicle. What? I'm not interested in your opinion, Lieutenant. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, Archer, but it doesn'twork. We need more than time. Another chance to what, get killed? It wouldn't have made a damn bit of difference. You weren't in that cockpit. There's plenty wrong. You just refuse to see it. Every time there's a problem with this project, you blame iton pilot error or gravitational anomalies, or some technicalmalfunction. Well, you're going to have to face the truth this time,because there's nothing left to point an finger at. Your fatherdesigned a lousy engine. We're done flying. No use hanging around. Here you go. Suit yourself. Look, I was out of line. That's good of you to admit, but it doesn't really matternow. You heard Forrest. The programme is on hold indefinitely. What about the Vulcans? They'll look at your data and say weneed to run computer simulations for another ten years to prove thatyou're right. Forrest answers to Starfleet Command. It's out of his hands. If you want to convince the Vulcans, you'll have to do a lotbetter than showing them a bunch of antimatter calculations. We only lost one ship. Still have one left. Can you think of a better way to prove it'll fly? You want totalk about taking risks? You're a great pilot, maybe as good as me, butyou're never going to get out into deep space by playing it safe. Whenthe first warp five starship is built, it's Captain won't be able tocall home every time he needs to make a decision. He won't be able toturn to the Vulcans, unless he decides to take one with him. That's because they haven't been installed yet. Not to late to call this off, head over to the 602 for abeer. By the time they figure out what's going on, we'll be halfway to Jupiter. Why don't you take it? I had the last flight. You're due up. Besides, you could use the practice. I hope you and Tuckerwere right about that intermix. That's warp two. Almost. Sir. If we follow all their recommendations, we'll never make itinto deep space. Get Lieutenant Tucker in here. Ask any engineer on theproject. They'll tell you this ship can fly. Archer and I just provedit. We're ready to go. Now. To Jonathan Archer, first skipper of the Starship Enterprise, and one lucky s. o. b. It couldn't have been talent. I'm just waiting for Forrest torealise what a horrible mistake he made. Still, they could have done alot worst. Anyway, I'd rather wait for the NX02. Let you make all themistakes so I'll have an easier time of it. Got to go. I'm catching a shuttle to Alice Springs at oh sixhundred. More survival training. Night, Ruby. Good luck, Jon. Hey, I'llsee you out there."

Do you think this is going to get either of you any closer towarp five? Congratulations, Captain."

3293,ENT,episode 49,ARCHER,"Maybe you were light-headed from the altitude. I walked on the same rocks you did. Report. Any idea what he wants? T'Pol's mentioned them. Open a channel. This is Jonathan Archer of the Enterprise. What can I do for you? I didn't get your name. We're studying this planet. I have three science teams on the surface. We're also here for a little shore leave. Vacation. It's been a while since we've had a chance to relax. You've been here before? Where are they? Sure we're not intruding? T'Pol says they're not the most agreeable species. Apparently they enjoy a good argument. It's considered a sport on their planet. What do you want? I asked you a question. I doubt this ship of yours will be a match for Enterprise. I want to know where you're taking me. My crew's not going to give up until they find me. If you take me back, I'd be willing to forget this ever happened. How much are they paying you? You mentioned the Klingon homeworld, Kronos. I assume this has something to do with my escaping prison. You don't even know what I'm accused of. I have no idea what the Klingons are paying you, but whatever it is, Starfleet will double it. I'm not a criminal. My crime was helping a ship full of refugees. It's pretty clear I'm never going to get the chance. I was sentenced to life in prison on Rura Penthe. Ever heard of it? The magistrate isn't going to be so lenient next time. I'll probably be executed. You don't care that you're sending an innocent man to his death. If the Klingons wanted them, they probably were. You don't have to do this. It must be difficult working for people like them. That's not how it looks from in here. Who's Tezra? You're going to use the reward to buy your ship back? Let me out. I can help you. You can't manoeuvre the ship and make repairs at the same time. I'm a pilot, let me take the helm. Navigation sensors. There's an L class planet in this system. I'm taking us out of warp. We can't outrun him but he may not be able to navigate as well as we can in the planet's atmosphere. What about forward cannons? What are these? Get ready to launch them. He's flying on sensors, just like we are. He'll only have a one in three chance of targeting us. Now. We knocked out his engine. He's making an emergency landing. Isn't that a shame. Then you'd better get to work. Then we should set down here. We'll land a thousand kilometres away. That ship you mentioned, the Tezra, sounds pretty important to you. I don't understand why you want a cargo ship. It doesn't seem practical in your line of work. My helmsman used to run freight. The two of you would probably have a lot to talk about. You never told me why it was impounded. They took your ship? Did you really think I wanted this engine fixed? You're taking me to be executed. What do you plan to do now? And then? I suppose you'll turn me over to the Klingons. I'll be disembowelled with one of those nasty looking swords of theirs. You'll collect your nine thousand darseks but it won't get you the Tezra back. The Klingons took your freighter, your livelihood, damaged your relationship with your brother, and what do you get in exchange? Nine thousand darseks. Doesn't seem like a very fair trade to me. Maybe not. Have you ever been aboard Goroth's ship? That's blood money, Skalaar. I hope you enjoy it. What's the status of the Klingons? Where's T'Pol? What happened? Do you think the Klingons know you gave me that lock pick? What are you going to do with your reward? I'll keep my eyes open. I hope you won't be the one to collect it."

3301,ENT,episode 49,REED,"It dropped out of warp thirty minutes ago. The pilot sent a brief audio message. He insisted on speaking with you right away. He wouldn't say, but I did manage to find his ship design in the Vulcan database. It's Tellarite. Send a security team. Bridge to Captain Archer. Engage the emergency clamps. Pursuit course. Get those teams up from the surface. Sensors are picking up a faint warp signature. Bearing oh seven one mark three two. It's erratic, but it matches our Tellarite friend. The signature's holding steady. Looks like he's orbiting a G-type star. It appears to be a beacon of some kind. It's generating a warp signature identical to the Tellarites. I'm getting too much interference from that device. It's throwing off our scans. With pleasure, sir. Bridge to Commander Tucker. We're approaching the coordinates. Two matching warp signatures, both in the upper atmosphere. More subspace beacons. There is a ship on the surface. It seems to have suffered engine damage, but it's not Tellarite. One. She's still in this section. The doctor says she's irrational, so use caution. We've been very worried about you, Sub-Commander. Let's get you back to the Doctor. I beg your pardon Why don't we discuss this in Decon. Doctor Phlox was very insistent. Follow me, Sub-Commander. I've got them. Bearing two two six mark seven one. They're closing in on him. They're charging weapons. I'm doing the best I can, sir. Their weapon ports are heavily shielded. Their weapons are down. It's a long story."

3304,ENT,episode 49,T'POL,"How long until we have warp drive. I'm on my way to the Bridge. Is it contagious? Perhaps you can increase the dosage. There must be something else you can try. I can't stay here several hours. I told you to leave them alone. I wasn't aware a curtain was installed. An odd attitude for a physician. If you wouldn't mind. You're making it difficult to meditate. I can't concentrate under these conditions. The Captain's been abducted, he may even be dead. My place is on the Bridge. Open it. I'll go to my quarters. If I seal off the ventilation system it should minimise the risk of exposing anyone. Unlock this door. I gave you a direct order. I can have you court-martialed. Open it! I apologise. I'm having trouble suppressing my emotions. You said we'd need another treatment. Is there any harm in starting now? Rest is not what I need. My name is T'Pol. You don't find me attractive? I am familiar with Denobulan sexuality. I know that your marriages aren't exclusive. Starfleet regulations. There's no reason to be restrained by human morality. You have no idea what you're denying yourself. You don't understand. I'm not ill. They're normal for a Vulcan in my condition. It's not something we discuss with others. We call it the pon farr, the cycle of mating. It's not time. What caused it doesn't matter. If I don't mate with a male, Vulcan or otherwise, I'll die. I'm hungry. I wasn't referring to food. There's a far simpler treatment. You have the cure. It's unethical for you to withhold it, Doctor. I'm willing to try. Don't be frightened. I won't hurt you. No more hyposprays. Is that food? Let me out. The heat. It's unbearable. I don't want your serum. Open the door. Open it! Stay away from me. Malcolm. I need your assistance. I can't return to the doctor. He's refusing to treat me. How long has it been? Since you've mated. I've seen the way you look at me on the Bridge. My quarters would be more comfortable. Did I do anything inappropriate? Did we? I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone."
3305,ENT,episode 49,TUCKER,"I didn't slip. That overhang gave way the moment I put my foot on it. Maybe you loosened them. You do weigh a few kilos more than I do. Sounds like we could use a guide. I've got an old girlfriend this guy might like to meet. We're having trouble isolating his signature. There must have been something masking it. Less than an hour. Acknowledged. Can you get a fix on it? Set a course, maximum warp. Go to Tactical Alert. A decoy! Anything on sensors? We're going to have to start all over. Then get rid of it. Anyone hungry in there? I brought you some supper. How are you two holding up? We're tracking another warp signature, hoping this one is the real thing. Are those the ones you wanted? Yeah. I had Chef make you some Is she all right? Go ahead. On my way. Call if you need anything. What have you got? Biosigns? Open a channel. Sorry to bother you, but we're looking for a Tellarite shuttle. Have you seen one? Klingons? Look, there must be some sort of misunderstanding here. We're looking for our Captain. Travis, how close are we to Klingon space? If that Tellarite's looking to collect some kind of reward we'd better find him before he gets there. Set a course. Take us back to warp. Tucker here. What? Put him through.Â  Set a course. Go to Tactical Alert. What about the Klingons? Return fire. Deploy the grappler. Malcolm? Bring him in. The pod? Let's get the hell out of here. Rough ride? We damaged their port nacelle. They're limping back to Kronos. She's in Decon with Doctor Phlox."

3313,ENT,episode 49,PHLOX,"I'm afraid you're not going anywhere for the moment. We brought a stowaway with us, an unusual microbe. I'll have to run some more tests. To be safe, we should both go through Decon. This microbe is more resilient than I thought. It doesn't seem to be vulnerable to theta radiation. That wouldn't be advisable. We'd both suffer permanent cellular damage. Decon gel E may neutralise the microbe, but it will be several hours before we know if it's effective. You have little choice. This organism appears to be infectious and humans would be far more vulnerable to it than you or I. Commander Tucker is quite capable. If he needs your help, he knows where to find you. Fortunately no one else on the surface was exposed to the microbe. I suspect you and I were contaminated when we climbed into the second ravine. Considering the quantity of fauna down there, I'm not at all surprised. We were probably infected by the marsupials I found. Their saliva is a natural anti-coagulant. I couldn't return to the ship without a sample. I could use your assistance. Not everyone is comfortable with the idea of disrobing in front of others. It's a characteristic of Denobulan males. We're more inhibited than our women. It's led to a number of awkward moments. My Starfleet physical was an experience I never hope to repeat. You've developed a slight fever. I'm also reading elevated dopamine levels. The microbe may be affecting your limbic system. I don't mean to be intrusive. Sub-Commander, where are you going? You'll spread the infection. Your quarters are on C deck. By the time you reach them you'll contaminate half the ship. I'm sorry, but I can't obey it. I doubt that very We'll know in a few hours whether the gel is working. Until then, perhaps a mild sedative will help? What are you doing? Not for three hours. I can apply it myself, thank you. Perhaps you need another sedative. Sub-Commander, this behaviour is hardly appropriate. Of course I do, but that is not the issue. You and I are colleagues. It's against regulations. It's obvious you're not well. Please. Your endorphin and hormonal levels are dangerously high. These are hardly normal readings. You know what's wrong with you? I believe it's time for you to amend that policy. You have my assurance it will remain between us. Have you gone through this before? It's possible the infection acted as a catalyst. Feel any better? Our meals will be here soon. I'm working as quickly as I can. The serum should help alleviate most of your symptoms. I'd prefer to explore a more conventional approach. This mating cycle of yours was artificially induced. We can't be certain that a physical encounter would help. Sub-commander. You're disturbing my serum! You obviously need to be sedated again. One of us should probably answer that. It could be news about the Captain. This is Phlox. Just in the nick of time, Commander. It would be best if you remained here. Well enough. Have you been able to locate Captain Archer? Yes, thank you. She developed a slight fever. Nothing to be concerned about. I beg your pardon? You know I can't do that. If I lower the temperature, the serum will start to congeal. I assure you, you're going to feel much better in just a few minutes. This will only take a moment. Your biochemical imbalance is growing worse. If we don't treat it now, the damage to your limbic system could be irreversible. You said it yourself, T'Pol, it could kill you. One injection, that's all I ask. Very well. You're free to go. Four two eight six four. That's the locking code. Denobulan medical ethics prevent me from treating patients against their will. Four two eight six four! Phlox to the Bridge. You may want to evacuate D deck. You'll be pleased to know the microbe's been eliminated from your system. Your premature mating cycle has ended. I've had patients treat me far worse. Denobulan males aren't comfortable discussing such topics. I'd never violate a patient's privacy."

Goroth contacted me because you obviously weren't going to succeed. You're incompetent! The human. Now. Yes. How much did the Klingons offer you? Your Captain. He's got a price on his head. He's probably halfway to Klingon space by now.
3515,ENT,episode 49,SKALAAR,"You can start by telling me what you're doing here. Captain Skalaar of the Tellarite Mining Consortium. Shore leave? In that case, I recommend you visit the equatorial range. The view from the north summit is inspiring. Many times. I prefer to think of it as my own personal retreat. You mustn't leave until you've experienced the hydrothermal pools of Ren-gham. The polar island chain, two hundred and twenty seven kilometres from the southern tip of the Rykos shoreline. Look for the pyroclastic debris field then follow the lava tubes I'd be happy to show you. Not at all. I'll meet you at your starboard docking port. I'll help you plan your shore leave. I'd stay clear of those emitters if I were you. The very latest technology. I installed them last month. I've taken appropriate counter-measures. We won't be seeing any more of your starship. You can either be quiet or spend the rest of this trip unconscious. Which do you prefer? I'm trying to reach Captain Goroth. It's very important that I speak with him. I have the fugitive. He's standing about five metres from me. You'll be pleased to know he's still alive. I'm bringing him to Kronos as we agreed. I trust you'll have the full payment? A pleasure doing business with you, Captain. As always. You're right, and I don't care to. I don't take bribes from criminals. Klingon Judiciary says you are. Oh, that was very noble of you. You'll think twice before doing that again. I'm familiar with Rura Penthe. That's not my concern. I've captured dozens of fugitives. Every one of them claimed to be an innocent man. Goroth already knows you're aboard. If I don't deliver you he'll offer a reward for both of us. I've learned never to cross a Klingon. I don't answer to those savages. I work for myself. If you knew how much they were paying me you'd understand. This has nothing to do with you. I'm sure you're not a bad person, just an unlucky one. The Klingons are paying nine thousand darseks. That's more than enough to get Tezra back. I already have the human in custody. The reward is guaranteed. In two days you'll see I'm telling the truth. Do you want to scrub plasma injectors the rest of your life? I'm giving you a chance to Tezra's not a person, it's a cargo ship. Far more impressive than this antique. You'd be wise to keep quiet. The Klingons pay me the same whether you're alive or dead. A vessel's approaching. I wouldn't get too optimistic. It's not your starship. Always one step behind me, eh, Kago? Why would I do that? Goroth told you where I was, didn't he. If I was incompetent Archer would be aboard your ship, wouldn't he? Or what, you'll destroy my shuttle? Can't collect on Archer if he's a cloud of vapour. You may want to hold on to something. You must think I'm a fool. If you try to escape. There. What? This ship wasn't designed for these manoeuvres. We've lost the aft cannons. Still online. Subspace beacons. They generate a false warp signature. I used one of them to evade your vessel. What good will that do? Ready. Don't celebrate yet. Our reactor's leaking. The warp drive's offline. I'm never going to make the rendezvous. The reactor also powers life support. It can only be accessed from the outer hull. But Kago's on the surface. More than you know. If Kago collects the reward he'll probably waste it on Orion slave girls. Not me, I'm going to do something useful with it. You think I've been chasing fugitives my entire life? Once I get the money I'll have enough to pay off the impound fees. I'll be a freighter captain again. The Tezra isn't like any other cargo ship. She was the first of her class, the fastest ever built. She could haul a million metric tons at warp four point five. Even your starship isn't capable of that. I retrofitted her engines myself. My brother and I were hauling a shipment of fire-salt. I thought I could trim two or three days off our journey by cutting across the most insignificant corner of Klingon space. I learned very quickly there's no thing as an insignificant corner of Klingon space. We were lucky to escape with our lives, though we did pay a price. And it's cargo too. My brother never forgave me. I've been trying to find a way to get the Tezra back every since. What are you doing! Don't worry, we'll meet Goroth on time. I need your help. You think I would have come here if I had a choice? I need an antimatter injector. Do you know who this is? He's the only prisoner who's ever escaped from Rura Penthe. The Klingons are offering a fortune to get him back. Tell him. Tell him! Of course I'm coming back. You're going to be my first officer. Scrubbing plasma injectors? Is that how you want your children to see you? You think that I enjoy spending my time with vermin like him? Please, don't turn your back on me again. We can reclaim the Tezra. Why not? The engines? Get that injector and install it. What are you trying to say? What choice do I have? I told you, if I let you go they'd kill me. Twice. Why? Welcome. What about my payment? We agreed to nine. I see you made it back safely. I don't see why they would. I'm not sure. If you know of an old freighter for sale? Be careful, Captain. It's likely the Klingons will double their bounty. No promises. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek Â® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

The Empire never forgets its enemies. Taka! Six thousand darseks. Did we? Where do you think you can go, human? There isn't a planet within fifty light years. He won't get far. Drop out of warp. No. I want him alive."

You shouldn't have brought him. And I suppose you have no way of paying for it. If I give you the injector, you have to promise never to come back here. That was years ago. I work here now. It's better than hunting criminals. I have work to do. You won't want that ship after you see it. The Klingons cannibalised her. Every power relay, every conduit. They're gone.

3521,ENT,episode 50,ARCHER,"There's been an attack on Earth. A probe. They don't know where it came from. It fired a weaponthat cut a swath four thousand kilometres long from Florida toVenezuela. There may have been a million casualties. We've been recalled. I didn't ask. Go ahead. Understood. Set a course, Travis. Warp five. Come in. Trip. No, I'm sorry. Older or younger? Maybe she was away. The number of casualties has been revised. It's up to threemillion. Come in. And? What do they know? Trip's sister lives in Florida. Archer. Just what we need. Tactical alert. Hail them. Try again. Silik! I knew you'd have something to do with this. Millions of people. You killed millions of people! What the hell am I doing here? Information about what? Who is he? What do you want? I'm aware of that. How would they know what's going to happen in four hundredyears? Are they the ones the Suliban are working for? So you're the one who tried to start a civil war in the KlingonEmpire, the one who's manipulated my mission from day one. Annihilate us before we can annihilate them. Why are youtelling me this? Why should I believe you? He didn't think we'd believe him. He's probably right. He may be telling the truth. If he is, I need your support, notyour damn scepticism. Captain's Starlog, April 24th, 2153. The journey home has been verydifficult. We've now learned that over seven million people were lost. Where? Who are they? You still have torpedoes. Duras. A Klingon named Duras. He's not very fond of me. Do they have a better idea of who did this? And how about theVulcans? I suppose you think I'm hallucinating. Are you willing to risk a second attack? All I'm asking is totake Enterprise and find these Xindi. What do we have to lose, a singlestarship. Seems like a small price to pay if there's one chance in amillion that he's right. At warp five, about a three month trip. What's that? Sounds like your talking about the Bermuda Triangle. It's a risk I'm willing to take, and I imagine most of my crewwould be with me. I'm not sure the person I spoke to was from the future or not,but he knew this would be the reaction that I'd get, so he did give meproof. This is quantum dating the debris. Take a look. The principalalloy in this piece was synthesised within the last four years. Thisone, about a year earlier. Twelve years for this piece. I'm getting to it. You might findthis interesting. Why is that, sir? What's wrong with that? Then I guess this ones not working either. I haven't the slightest idea. But that doesn't change what's onthese scanners. This fragment's from the future, unless you haveanother explanation. I'd like to take a look in there. I sure as hell would like to find out. I don't have a lot of time. What's up? Why didn't Starfleet catch it? No. I feel fine. I know, Vulcan's don't believe in time travel. How do you know about that? He seemed humanoid, but I couldn't see him that well. A number of times. Does this have anything to do with theradiation? Doesn't help. I told you, it doesn't help. It's kind of strange that a Vulcan would be so interested in myfeelings. Why would you imagine that? Soval sure is persistent. What did he want you to do? Come backwith proof that I'm out of my mind? Well I'm telling you to get the hell off my ship. If youwouldn't mind, Phlox, I'd like you to escort our guest to the airlock. You're a sight for sore eyes, Tommy. Slow tonight. Is she here? Thanks. Bring me a Scotch. I'm really sorry. I wish it was longer. I was hoping to spend some time with you. We know a little bit, but not enough. I'll probably be gone fora long time, Becky. What are my chances? How'd it go with your folks? I doubt it. We got the new upgrades for the UniversalTranslator. It'll never replace a linguist with a magical ear. Well, that's a matter of opinion. Languages of the Sub-Sahara. I'm surprised you're leaving that onehere. So why not take it with you? And the clothes are going to? I thought you were leaving. I don't know. You're a teacher, an academic. That's not what I meant. I wouldn't have it any other way. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. After days of debate, Starfleet'sfinally informed me that we're to proceed with our new mission. The NX-02. A long time. Hopefully. What kind of armaments will she have? This morning. Some haven't decided yet, but I don't think more then eight ornine will be leaving. I talked to General Casey a few hours ago. I don't have a problem with non-Starfleet personnel. TheGeneral tell me these are the best he has. I'm going to need all themuscle I can get when we cross into the Expanse. Not even a hint. I didn't think he would have warned us if we didn't have achance of stopping them. With all due respects Admiral, what is the point of me watching this. Is it supposed to frighten me, make me change my mind about commandingthis mission? Are you suggesting the crew was responsible? Is there anything else, sir? Soval agreed to let us take her back to Vulcan if it's all right withyou. Scheduled to be done by oh six hundred. No, sir. It's bad enough one of us is up in the middle of the night. He must be doing better then we are. He's fast asleep. No. When they first assigned her, I felt like strangling Soval. I would think you'd be the first one to show her to theairlock. When I got this job, commanding the first warp five ship wasabout as big as a responsibility as I could imagined. Then, we beganrunning into so many bad guys, and I had to start thinking more aboutthe safety of eighty three people. Weight of the world, Trip. We'll do what we have to do, Trip. Whatever it takes. You've been wanting to test those new torpedoes. Start low. We just want to get them off our backs. Bring the yield up. Fifty percent. How long will it take them to repair their engines? Give me an educated guess. What's our speed? Go to four five. If we can make it to Vulcan space before theyget their engines back, they'll think twice about giving us any moretrouble. Come in. Why don't you sit down? Just think, in two daysyou'll be eating real Vulcan food. Well you never did care for the way we smelled. At least youwon't have to put up with that anymore. How about all those emotions we bombard you with every day? You're not making this easy. There's got to be something you'relooking forward to back home. What? It's not a question of my allowing you. The High Command wouldnever agree to it. Why? You've worked so hard, T'Pol. We'll be all right. I've been thinking about who to promote. Keeping away from those Klingons isn't going to be easy as we thought. We're not going to Vulcan. Mister Mayweather, set course forthe Delphic Expanse. Distance? Magnify. The Vulcans said the Expanse is surrounded by thick layers ofthermobaric clouds. When their last ship went in, it took them almostsix hours to get through it. Anything on long range sensors? Point two impulse, Travis. Let's head in. Anything? Let's be patient. Keep them apprised of our position. Got something? We're not in the Expanse yet. Hold your course. Go to fullimpulse. You heard me, Travis. Put it up. Go to hell. That's why Duras wants us to come about. He's afraid of theExpanse. Increase speed, Travis. Keep firing. I won't bet on it. Your new torpedoes aren't having the sameeffect as last time. If he's transferred his shielding forward, what's protectinghis stern? What's protecting his stern? Think you can pull off an L4 at this speed? Then look for the densest cloud formation you can find. CaptainArcher to all hands, hold on! Looks good to me. Fire. Nice going, Travis. Did you lose any more of those injectors? Sure you still want to tag along? Straight and steady. Mister Mayweather. Let's see what's inthere. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

3531,ENT,episode 50,SOVAL,"Our Science Directorate has determined that time travel isimpossible. Do you know where these co-ordinates he gave you are? They're inside the Delphic Expanse. A region of space nearly two thousand light years across. Vulcanships have entered it, but only a few have returned. There has been reports of fierce and dangerous species,unexplained anomalies. In some regions, even the laws of physics don'tapply. Twenty years ago, a Klingon vessel emerged from the Expanse. Every crewmen on board has been anatomically inverted, their bodiessplayed open, and they were still alive. You'd be more than foolish topursue this course of action. This is typical of your impulsiveness. You'd be putting yourcrew's lives at stake when you have no evidence that anything you weretold were true. What exactly are you trying to show us, Captain? You said he told you this faction from the future could onlycommunicate through time, so how do you suggest they get this componentto the Xindi? A lack of another explanation doesn't make your assumptioncorrect. Are you suggesting this is a Xindi? It's important for you to see what you'll be facing. TheVaankara was in the Delphic Expanse for less then two days when wereceived a distress call. This transmission arrived six hours later. Less then an hour later the Vaankara was destroyed. There was noindication of a malfunction or an attack. I'm suggesting you reconsider this mission. I need to speak with you, T'Pol. If all goes well you should be able to return to your duties on Earthwithin a year. That is, if you're still interested. You haven't beenback to Vulcan for some time. You may find your assignment at theMinistry of Information refreshing. You've spent far to much time with humans. It would be best ifyou returned home for a while. You were there to provide logic to a crew of humans who insistedon leaving before they were ready, but logic can't help them inside theDelphic Expanse. The High Command was quite specific. You're to return to Vulcan. This is not the matter of choice. Defying the High Command wouldmean immediate dismissal. You know that."
3532,ENT,episode 50,T'POL,"I spoke with Ambassador Soval. A Vulcan transport located the pod in central Asia. Theyretrieved it and brought it to Starfleet Headquarters. Very little. There was a pilot, killed on impact. They don't know. No. If this time traveller is trying to protect humanity, why didn't hetell you all this before millions of people were killed? I'm sure Starfleet and the High Command will find a far morelogical explanation of who attacked Earth. It's a Klingon bird of prey. Are you confident with your decision, Doctor? To remain on Enterprise. Crewman Fuller just told me a shuttle'son its way with two hundred snow beetles. There isn't a doctor in Starfleet that would have the slightestidea what to do with them. The High Command has made it clear that they don't want me toenter the Delphic Expanse. it's not my place to disobey the High Command. Thank you, Doctor. I don't understand why I can't stay in San Francisco. You thought it was crucial to place a Vulcan on Enterpriseduring its first mission. Why not now? Can you be certain of that? I believe that should be my decision. It's Duras. Impossible to determine. Three hours, possibly more. Ensign Mayweather says we're two days from Vulcan. Chef's done an adequate job of approximating Vulcan cuisine. I've gotten use to it. I've grown accustomed to that as well, somewhat. I don't wish to return to Vulcan. I want to remain aboard Enterprise, if you'll allow me to. I've decided to resign my commission. You're taking Enterprise into a very dangerous place. This is notime for me to leave. You'll need a science officer, whether she's a member of theHigh Command or not. You need me, Captain. A common mistake when viewing something of this size. Nothing beyond the perimeter. Nothing yet. Yes. Not unless you launched three of them. The perimeter clouds are dissipating. I'm detecting clear spaceahead. The Expanse is less than five minutes away. Minimal shielding. It's only logical."
3533,ENT,episode 50,TUCKER,"What's going on? About what? Well, something's obviously up. What do you mean, attack? Did they say why? Excuse me, Captain. When you spoke to Admiral Forrest, did he say what part ofFlorida was hit? She may have been away. Architects take a lot of trips. My baby sister. When we were in school I made sure all the boysin her class got a good look at me. None of them ever messed with her. Anything you can tell me about what the Admiral said? Why would someone do this? Who the hell was he? What species? They say anything about what part of Florida was hit? The house was over there. Less then a kilometre. See overthere? That was the oldmovie theatre. When we were kids, if I didn't take my sister with meshe'd scream like a banshee. Someone would have heard from her if she wasn't. How long is it going to take to reconfigure the tubes? Let's go. For Lizzie? If you're talking about a funeral, it's kind ofpointless when there's nothing left. My sister wasn't big on memorials. Why are you so obsessed with memorials? She's dead. So are seven million others. She was no moreimportant than any of them. I'm getting real tired of you telling me what I can and can'tdo. And while we're at it, I don't need you to remind me that Elizabethwas killed, so just let it alone. Maybe you should pay more attentionto upgrading your weapons, so you can blow the hell out of thosebastards when we find them. How's Porthos holding up? If no peoplehave returned from the Delphic Expanse, I doubt any dogs have. You picked a new science officer? You're gonna miss her, aren't you. She does kind of grow on you. Nah. ToHenry Archer. I wonder what he would have thought if he knew his enginewas gonna help save the human race. And now the stakes have gotten a lot bigger. Literally. I can't wait to get in there, Captain, and find thepeople who did this. And tell me we won't be tiptoeing around. None ofthat non-interference crap T'Pol's always shoving down our throats. Maybe its good thing she's leaving. Looks a hell of a hell of a lot closer than that. Not very helpful. We launched the communications buoy, sir. We got atest signal through to Starfleet. Probably the buoy. I thought you said the Klingons wouldn't go into the Expanse. I wouldn't recommend that, Captain. The intake manifolds arehaving a tough enough time as it is. Maybe he'll turn around like his friends. We just lost three antimatter injections, Captain. Any more andwe're in big trouble. Does it matter? He's chasing us. No, sir. We're good to go."
3534,ENT,episode 50,SILIK,"There's someone who needs to speak with you. Do with what? I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. That wouldn't be wise, Captain. There's someone who needs to speak with you. He has informationyou should find helpful. Don't worry, you won't be harmed. Something to do with your species. It's in great danger.

I'm goingto need all the muscle I can get when we cross into the Expanse. We'll do what we have to, Trip. How long till we get there? The foreman of the north mine. He's expecting us. He's not. He just said he thinks there was a Xindi aboard atransport he took there a few years ago. He didn't mention any. Where are we, Malcolm? This room. What did it used to be? But it got retrofitted. Starfleet went to a lot of trouble toturn it into our new Command centre. Why is that, Malcolm? To find the Xindi, right? So this state of the art equipment was put in here to help usgather all the pieces of the puzzle, figure out who's trying to destroyEarth. Six weeks. We've been in this Expanse for six weeks. What datahave we gathered? What pieces of the puzzle have we started to puttogether? Not a single one. We don't have the luxury of being safe orcautious any more, and if the only lead we can find comes from afreighter captain of questionable character, then that's good enoughfor me. Understood? Just bay two? When did it start? You're sure it's not a problem with the grav-plating. You're right. It's not the grav-plating. Any volatile materialin those containers? Seal it off. Let's hope this little anomaly doesn't last anylonger than the others did. The Doctor said it was safe for short periods. Try not to breathe. I'm Captain Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We've come tosee your I'm Jonathan Archer. This is Lieutenant Reed. Depends what you mean by worth your while. I'm afraid we don't carry precious metals on board. I'm sure there's something else we could offer you. What about the antimatter relays? How much platinum are we talking about? I'd need to see this man, scan him, confirm that he's Xindi. Why would you do this? Is it Xindi? I need something a little more concrete, Doctor. Like humans and Neanderthals? How's it coming? Let me know when it's ready. You okay? There'sa little more than a half litre in here. I have something to discuss with him. I brought you what you asked for. Now let me see the Xindi. It took six of my men half the night to extract this platinum. I think you could wake him an hour early. Our outer hull is lined with duranium. And why would you imagine that? The foreman said it was an accident. You're Xindi? Where's your homeworld? We have important business with your people. What do you mean, escape? A simple set of coordinates, that's all I want. I'm prepared topay you. Trip, take it easy. Archer here. How long before they get here? Go to Tactical Alert. We're heading back to theshuttlepod. Archer to Enterprise. Enterprise, respond. Sewage takes on a whole new meaning when it comes from a dozendifferent species. What are you doing? If this leads to the surface why didn't you use it before? One, and he didn't look very much like you. Thatsounded an awful lot like those emergency baffles we opened. I thought you said this duct isn't used anymore. How far up to the next maintenance hatch? How far? I think you're right. Suit yourself. We're going to have to pick up the pace, gentleman. You okay? Wherethe hell do you think you're going? You had your chance. You're lying. Come in. He wasn't a particularly helpful Xindi, Doctor. I'll be damned. They're the coordinates. Tactical Alert. Stand by weapons. Any indications that we'rebeing scanned? How many inhabited planets? Son of a bitch lied to us. A ship? Put it up. Move us in closer. How long ago did this happen? They're building a weapon, planning to annihilate Earth becausethey think we're going to destroy their world in four hundred years. How is that possible if their world doesn't exist anymore, hasn'texisted for decades. Prepare to go to warp four. Deeper into the Expanse. You heard me, Travis."

Did the freighter captain say who we were supposed to contact? And it is safe to enter orbit? There are no securityconsiderations? With all due respect, sir, we should approach with caution. Thefreighter captain was of questionable character. Sir? A storage bay, sir. Conduit housings, I believe. Because of our mission, sir. Right. Right. Understood. We should have worn EV suits. Safe? You call this safe? I've been in Yes, sir. Their linings are coated with a platinum-cobalt alloy. Trip couldprobably strip them down and separate the metals. Something doesn't smell right. The ionised particles will cover our descent. It'll be all right. Have you heard from the Captain? The ships? They're armed to the teeth down there, but it is do-able. We onlyhave one bone of contention. The Major here thinks my security team isfar to valuable to bring down and put in the line of fire. He wants totake his men. I plan to have my men back on board with the Captain and Triplong before those ships arrive. Select six of your men and meet me in launch bay one. I'll becommanding the mission. Coming from a military family, I've seen men like Hayes all mylife. That had nothing to do with who knows Enterprise inside and out. It had to do with who the Major thinks is more capable of carrying outthis rescue. The lower levels are hyper-saturated with ionised particles, so you'llhave to get within a hundred metres to pick up their biosigns. Captain! It took a little doing, sir, but we got through theouter hatch. Reed to Mayweather. We've got them. Lock onto my location and set down. We cleared bioscan, that's all that matters. The Doctor's got them back in their quarters already. I'm not so sure about that. See you in the morning. No, sir. No vessels, no signs of technology, nothing.

3765,ENT,episode 51,T'POL,"I believe that should be my decision. I want to remain aboard Enterprise. I've decided to resign mycommission. Another three hours. What makes this captain so certain that the miner's is Xindi? What are we looking at? It looks more like scales. You wanted to see me. No. I'm aware of that. It's to be expected. I'm not sure I understand. I doubt the Commander would have the patience to sit in oneplace long enough to get through the first posture. Delicate is not a word I associate with Mister Tucker. Theinstruction of neuro-pressure is a very intimate act. Have him come to my quarters. I don't understand. Captain. There are three warships approaching at warp. Their hull alloys matchthe mining towers on the surface. Understood. This is Enterprise. How long a delay? We've detected your cargo ships. They're heavily armed. Can I talk to Captain Archer? I spoke with him a few minutes ago. Keep trying to reach the Captain. I want you to come up with a plan to recover the Captain andCommander Tucker. Have it in place in one hour. Get Major Hayes to helpyou. Not yet. The foreman isn't responding to our hails. Less than an hour away. Are you ready? The decision is yours, Lieutenant, but I agree with Major Hayes. Your team may not be back in time. Lieutenant? Is everybody aboard? The warships? Tell the pods to dock simultaneously. Prepare to go to maximumwarp. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The three alien warships followedEnterprise for nearly an hour, but couldn't keep up with us. I guessthey'll have to look elsewhere for new additions to their labour force. Yes, Doctor. Thank you. Please, sit down. Would you like a cup of tea? You are having trouble sleeping as well. I believe the Expanse has been disrupting my patterns. Vulcan science teaches us to prompt our bodies to create theirown medicines. The neural nodes that need to be stimulated are difficult toreach. Perhaps you could help me. Three centimetres on either side of the fifth vertebrae. You can apply considerable pressure. Right there. A little closer together. Harder. Harder. Just like that. Please continue. Ahhh. That was far moreeffective than a hypospray. It would be only fair for me to return the favour. Please,disrobe. Are you implying I'm making sexual advances? The Doctor injected you with a placebo. He sent you here becausehe wanted me to persuade you to try Vulcan neuro-pressure. As Ipredicted, it was a pointless exercise. He did. You refused. The Doctor knows how intransigent you can be. Unwilling to compromise. Then take off your shirt. I'm not detecting any planets, inhabited or otherwise. It's nearly eighty million kilometres long. It was a planet. Judging by the field dispersion, approximately one hundred andtwenty years. We know the probe that attacked Earth was built somewhere inthis Expanse, and it was built recently. It's logical to assume the newweapon is being developed at the same location."
3766,ENT,episode 51,TUCKER,"My sister wasn't big on memorials. She was no more important than any of them. I can't wait to get in there, Captain, to find the people whodid this. And tell me we won't be tip-toeing around. None of thatnon-interference crap T'Pol's always shoving down our throats. Yes sir. Cargo bays one and three seem unaffected. About ten minutes ago. Ensign McFarlane got pretty banged upbut he's going to be okay. Trust me, Captain. It's not the grav-plating. Careful, sir. Stay close to the door. They're scaring me. I would have known by now. Elizabeth, please! Get out of there! Sir. We're going to end up stripping more than two hundred relays toget half a litre of liquified platinum, but you'll have it by thisafternoon. I'm fine. I've got to have something stronger to help me sleep tonight,Doc. Thanks. You're aware this stuff is volatile above thirty degrees Celsius. I've insulated the outer container. It should keep everythingpretty stable. Is trellium-D the only thing you mine here? I'm not familiar with it. What's it used for? I don't know what you're doing in this place and I don'tparticularly care, but we didn't come here to stage a prison break sowhy don't you just give us the co-ordinates and we'll all stop wastingeach other's kind. You know, I'm not sure why, but I'm just itching to kick thehell out of you. Why is there a hatch here? What was that? Why would they open the rest? They'll just help us escape I think the safest bet is to head back down to the last one. Shut up. Just shut up. Wait a minute! What the hell? You stupid son of a bitch. I ought to open this hatch and throwyou down into Nice shot. That was before your little performance back there. Captain? I must have been in the shower for two hours and I still had that crapin my hair and under my nails. Yeah. The two new guys that got hurt, are they okay? You've got to admit, their team did a pretty impressive jobdown there. Nothing your guys couldn't have done just as well. All right. Tired. You said you'd give me something to sleep? No problem, Doc. Thanks. Sorry to drop by so late, but Phlox said you were expecting this. I don't think I'd be very good company right now. Anyway, Istill have a few more showers to take before I get all this trellium-Doff me. Thanks, but it might keep me up. The Doctor just gave me asedative. I never would have pegged you for an insomniac. Probably nothing a good hypospray couldn't cure. So why are you still having trouble sleeping? I don't really know if I can I'm not sure which of these is Right here? If I push any harder I'll knock you over. Glad tobe of assistance. I'm really flattered, Sub-Commander, and don't think underdifferent circumstances I wouldn't jump at the chance No. No, no, no, not at all. I, I was just. You see, the Doctorgave me this sedative and I think it's starting to work. Why didn't he just ask me? Oh, so this whole thing was just a set up. Intransigent! I know what it means, but it just so happens it's not true. I'mas willing to compromise as anyone else. Phlox said the Xindi used his dying breath to give us thesecoordinates. Why would he lie? I'm pretty sure there was a population here, Captain. I'mpicking up refined metals and traces of alloys. Some of them match thehull of the Xindi probe. But, if it's not here"

Precisely. When I'm finished constructing my physiometricprofile I wouldn't be surprised to find he has reptiliancharacteristics. Do you have any siblings? Commander Tucker had one sister. She was killed in the attack. He's having difficulty dealing with the loss. More specifically, it's affecting his sleep. I've been givinghim sedatives, but I'd like to see him start tapering off. I believe the Commander would be a fine candidate for Vulcanneuro-pressure. I'm certain with your delicate guidance And he's suffered a very intimate loss. He needs your help. There's one little problem. Assuming that you'd agree to myrequest, I suggested all of this to Commander Tucker earlier today, andhe was less than enthusiastic. Perhaps if I could get him to go to your quarters, you might beable to convince him of the lasting benefits of Vulcan neuro-pressure. A blood sample would have sufficed, some saliva. Yes, and no. The genetic profile is nearly identical to the tissue samplestaken from the corpse found on Earth. Their base pair sequencing is farcloser than, say, humans and chimpanzees. Nearly identical, but notquite. A reasonable analogy. After analysing the remains of the Xindicorpse I was able to provide the computer with enough data to createthis rendering. However, this humanoid is reptilian, that finger isnot. It's covered with skin, not unlike yours or mine, but it's Xindiall the same. I wish I could be more helpful, Captain. Very well. Come by at around twenty two hundred hours. I'll seewhat I can do. I'm terribly sorry, Captain, but there was nothing I could do. Irealise how important it would have been to have a Xindi to help us. You'd be surprised. It was extremely difficult and painful forhim to speak, but he managed to dictate this to me before he died. Hesaid you'd know what it meant. How are you feeling, Commander? Very well. If you wouldn't mind, Commander. I promised T'Pol I'd take thesebioscans to her quarters, but I still have quite a bit of work to dohere. Sickbay to T'Pol. Commander Tucker is on his way to your quarters. He believes Ijust gave him a sedative, but it was only a placebo. He's had a ratherdifficult day. I believe you have your work cut out for you."

3993,ENT,episode 51,ARBOREAL,When will it be ready? We must be patient. We must follow the plan that we allagreed to. Then it's unlikely they'll survive.
3994,ENT,episode 51,HAYES,"Ma'am. We've familiarised ourselves with all the Bridge officers,Ensign. I'm Major Hayes, this is Sergeant Kemper, Corporals Romero andChang. Captain Archer wanted the best. Ensign Sato's a linguist, Kemper. You give her enough time, shecould probably tell you what street you grew up on. Let's hope it's soon. The quicker you folks find these Xindi,the quicker we can get to work. We have a briefing in a few minutes. Ifyou'll excuse you. Looks a little close to the mine, but I suppose it'll be all right. It's a simple matter of priorities. If those warships get herebefore we return from the surface, you could find yourselves dealingwith a boarding party. You'd be in far better hands with a securityforce who knows Enterprise inside and out. With all due respect, sir, we can't be certain of that. Very good, sir. Fayette, go."
3995,ENT,episode 51,FOREMAN,"Archer. I've been told you might be able to make it worth my while ifI were to arrange a certain introduction. I've always had a fondness for platinum, specifically in itsliquified state. Pity. I don't make a habit ofallowing people to interrupt my workers, Xindi or otherwise. Well, I'm a reasonable man. I'm sure you could part with, say,half a litre. That won't be necessary. Unfortunate accident. I expect to see you back tomorrow. Good day. I'm familiar with the properties of liquid platinum. What exactly do you want with our Xindi friend? He's not veryattractive, especially after his recent surgery. And what might that be? Hiswork group should be awake in about an hour's time. The only thing. Trellium-D. Insulation. Mostly for interstellar vessels. What insulationdoes your ship use, Captain? I imagine you must have a very large crew. Take your time. I'm afraid your Captain And his associate are going to be slightly delayed. We havethree cargo vessels approaching, and we've had To begin de-ionising our landing decks. No more than an hour. Trellium-D is a highly Valued substance, and I'm certain you've noticed that this is notone of the friendlier regions of space. Not at the moment. He requested to speak to a miner whoresides on level twenty two. The de-ionising process prevents us with communicatingwith the lower levels. I'll have him contact you as soon as he returns. That's impossible. Post guards at their landing craft. If they get back to theirstarship I'll lose nearly a hundred new workers. Duct thirteen. They've opened two emergency baffles. No, too valuable. How long would it take to redirect theplasma flow into that conduit? I'd have preferred having you join your crewmembers as newadditions to my workforce, but you've turned out to be more troublethan you're worth. Select a detail. Take them to the surface. Shoot allthree of them."
3996,ENT,episode 51,KEMPER,"Some of us are still visiting Doctor Phlox every morning. Actually, I'm stationed outside of Atlanta. No Denobulans, butwe have our fair share of alien visitors. You must have gone prettydeep into our records. I haven't lived in Duluth since junior highschool. Excuse me? Yes, sir."
3997,ENT,episode 51,KESSICK,"Do I have you to thank for this? Did he? What do you want. Nine fingered Xindi. What do you want? You came all the way to this hideous planet, bribed theforeman to see me, for what? Directions to my planet? I find that hardto believe. But you don't know where to find them. Well,if you want information, you're going to have to help me escape fromthis place. Do these look like volunteers? We're captives, slaves! The only payment I'm interested in is my freedom. If you can'tprovide me with that, stop wasting my time. Not until you get me off this planet. Shuttlepod? You have a starship in orbit? You've made it soeasy for them. Usually they have to go out and find ships to replenishtheir labour force. Youflew right into their trap. You might consider waiting for your colleagues to rescue you,but it sounds like they're about to become quite busy. If you have ashuttlepod on the surface I can get you to it, but you'll have to takeme with you. Thirty one, to be exact. Help me with this. There's a leverbelow your knees. Pull it up. Plasma duct thirteen hasn't been used since I've been here. There's one every eight levels. Opening the emergency baffle up there. It's a steel plate that locks into place during maintenance cycles. Follow me. The residue in the atmosphere is at least thirty times moretoxic than it is down here. This is the first time I've had the luxuryof a ship waiting for me. You've risked your lives to learn where my homeworld is,because you say you have important business with my people? Whichspecies? Have you ever even met a Xindi before today? Not all of them do. There are five distinct species of Xindi,and five distinct opinions on which one is dominant. It isn't. They've obviously re-routed the plasma. I don't know. That's where the plasma's coming from! We should go up. It's too late. We'll be killed. Get out of my way. They forced me to come with them. They said they'd kill me ifI didn't. Just now, this one, he tried to throw me into the plasma. Said they didn't need me any more. Thank you, thank you. If you hadn'tbeen waiting here I don't know what I You promised to take me away from here. No, please, you have to help me! The coordinates of my homeworld. If you want them you'll haveto take me with you. No, I promise you."
3998,ENT,episode 51,REPTILIAN,You're being naive. Their planet is fifty light years away. It is not a coincidence. How many humans are aboard? You will accomplish nothing if all you do is run tests. They scanned the debris and left nearly three hours ago. Toward the Orassin distortion fields.

What's our best speed? Set a course. Biosigns? Any sign of what happened to them? Have you spent much time in gravity boots, Corporal? This is an alien ship we're boarding. We could run intomagnetic variances. Watch your step. We're looking for anything that could tell us what happened tothem. Set weapons to stun. Let's find the Bridge. Try to access that station. Download what you can. We counted seventeen bodies. Most of them died when their life supportran out. The others were killed by particle weapons. What's our status? Archer to Mayweather. Resume our previous course, one quarter impulse. Those people have been dead for less than two days. Whoeverattacked them could still be nearby. We'll have to make repairs on themove. Mister Reed recovered some data from their Bridge. See what youcan make of it. How's it coming? What about tactical systems? Make them your priority. Weapons, Trip. As quickly as you can. Distance? Can you give me hull plating? Hail them. Hold your fire. Are those warheads armed? Stun grenade. Go! How many more? Get down there and help Trip. Corporal. How are they? Understood. What about him? You can observe him in the Brig. See to it. He's not from the Expanse? How bad is it? How long will that last, a month? This is all you've got? Any luck tracking their ship? For a people with no history of piracy, they've gotten prettygood at it. Keep looking. Such as what? Waiting for our antimatter to run dry? Keep looking. Open it. Doctor Phlox said your injuries were minor. Please getup. I have a dead crewman. No, one of your friends did. But I don't have one of yourfriends, I have you, so get up and look at me. Thank you. You're going to help me find your ship,and after I've taken back what they stole from me, you and yourcolleagues are free to go. That's a risk you'll have to take, because the alternative isgoing to be a lot less pleasant. I need what was stolen from me. There's too much at stake tolet my morality get in the way. You masked your ion trail. How? So you were forced into piracy. I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to find your ship, and ifthat ends up causing me remorse, then it's something I'm willing tolive with. Think about it. Did they leave a record of the modifications? What's our tactical situation. Torpedoes? I'll be in the Armoury. Any sign of a ship? T'Pol? Let's see it. Not yet. Why would there be such a large gap? Bring weapons online. Take us to where the first trail ends. Travis? Keep going. T'Pol. Ever seen anything like it? Take us in closer. Judging from those ion trails, the Osaarians spent over eighthours here. I want to find out why. Any luck scanning the interior? See if you can find something that looks like a way in. Take usinto orbit. Put it up. Can youtell what the door's made of? Can we fit through? Then get a pod ready. Did you find the locking mechanism? Hold our position. Try it now. Archer to Enterprise. We're heading in. Those modules have a breathable atmosphere. Do you see that docking port, Ensign? They've been busy. We've a lot of modules to search. Fan out,keep open comm. links. Archer. Travis? How's your Osaarian? Download what you can. Get it to Hoshi. Tell T'Pol we're goingto need another search team. It's probably running through the reactor of that Osaarianship. How's Trip doing? Have the away teams speed it up. I want to go to warp as soonas they're back. What else? Any idea what they were designed for? Take as many scans as you can. Go ahead. Sir, could you come to the Situation Room? HOSHI Your ship attacked a Xindi vessel. I want to know everything you cantell me about them. You heard me. You're lying. Your manifest said you took their ship less thantwo weeks ago. Tell me what you know. Where are they now? You destroyed them? Where did they come from? Which species of Xindi were they? What did they look like? Are you sure? We'll see about that. As you were. Ensign. Shut up.Â  Get in. The Xindi. This airlock has a decompression rate of point five atmospheresper minute. You'd better start talking now, because in about forty seconds youwon't be able to. The Xindi. Everything's under control, Lieutenant. Not for another twenty seconds he won't. The Xindi. Your memory getting any better? Say again? Take him back to the Brig. Eventually. When they attacked the Xindi ship they took morethan fuel and supplies. They downloaded their database. How close wouldwe have to get to tap into their main computer? He gave them to me. Here. I want that database. Go to Tactical Alert. Tell Trip we'regoing to need all the power he can spare for weapons and hull plating. We're going to wait for them to find us, Travis. Move us into position. Stand by. Have they detectedus? Open a channel. This is Captain Archer. Remember us? You probably noticed thatour weapons are back online. You're outgunned, so stand down. One kilometre, Travis. Get ready. Stay with them. Hoshi? Travis! How long do you need? Emergency bulkheads. Head back to the sphere. Where arethey? How much did you get? Take us closer to that portal. Let's see if we can lure themback in here. Use our forward phase cannon. Fire a single burst,minimum yield. Travis? Again. Stay within a kilometre. Return fire. Can you take out their engines? Ensign. Good enough. Mister Reed. Keep our weapons locked on them. Your codes worked. Get him out of there. Escort him to the Launch bay. We're taking you back to thesphere. Computer, load the Xindi database. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Two in Cargo Bay one, four more inEngineering. Woods, you're with me. Black tea, hot. You finished rewriting the physics books? A few hours rest might do you a world of good. You still can't sleep? I wasn't thinking anything. The Captain and I managed to bring the guidance systems online,but we're going to need more time for the aft launchers. Fuller knewthose torpedo systems better than anyone. He won't be easy to replace. Considering all the hostile aliens we've met, I suppose it's fortunatewe haven't lost more people. There's no reason to get cynical. What do you suggest we do, turn around and go back to Earth? Captain, the particle decay rates don't match. This one is atleast nine hours old, this one was left less than an hour ago. Power's fluctuating. Forward plating's down. Who could build something that big? That cloaking field is enormous. Whoever built this thing went toa great deal of trouble to conceal it. We've cycled through the standard frequencies. On the lower right side. What's that down there? Let's hope there's no one home. We're all clear, sir. They're not going to run out of stem-bolts any time soon. Thisway. Starfleet ration packs. Check behind those canisters. Captain? The airlock's decompressing, sir. He'll die.

4012,ENT,episode 52,T'POL,"Captain to the Bridge. We're getting reports of anomalies from all over the ship. None, and there's no atmosphere aboard. Artificial gravity'sdown as well. Ensign Sato managed to bring the transceiver online, but otherthan that. It might be best to complete repairs before we head deeper intothe Expanse. If we encounter any more anomalies Lock them out. High Command hasn't had much contact with the Osaarians. Theyhave a large merchant fleet, but there's no record of piracy. Not yet. They've found a way to mask their ion trail. It appears they've adapted their weapons and engines tocompensate for the anomalies. Pursuing them will be dangerous. Weshould consider other alternatives. I'm only suggesting that we may be able to replenish oursupplies elsewhere. I've been studying the datarecovered from the derelict. Apparently, they decided to look for theOsaarians as well. They found a way to modify their sensors to detectthe ion trail. Their life support failed before they had a chance tostart. I've already given it to Ensign Mayweather. Hull plating's back online. We should have phase cannons withinthe hour. Lieutenant Reed is still having difficulty modifying theguidance systems to compensate for the anomalies. Curious. The trail resumes after another seventy thousandkilometres. Their ions may have been dispersed by stellar winds. Microfractures are forming on the outer hull. We should comeabout. It's approximately nineteen kilometres in diameter. No. It's constructed entirely of a single alloy. Our sensors are being deflected. I'm detecting what appears to be a portal, twenty two degreesnorth of our current position. Polyduranium. The same metal as the Osaarian's hull. Go ahead. Understood. The search teams have found nearly eighty percent of our antimatter. They're looking for the rest. We've also recovered most of our weapons. He'll have warp drive online within the next thirty minutes. Quantum scans indicate it's nearly a thousand years old. The structure contains seven fusion reactors. Each one is almosttwelve kilometres long. Only three are still operational. The sphere's emitting massive amounts of gravimetric energy. Itmay have something to do with the spatial anomalies. Was he cooperative? They are heavily armed. Are you sure it's wise to engage them? Not yet. Anything? Forward hull plating is offline. Hull fracture on E deck, section fourteen. We're ventingatmosphere. Hull plating's offline. They're targeting our reactor."
4013,ENT,episode 52,TUCKER,"This can't be right. Did you run a diagnostic? Let's check those relays.Â  I don't get it, Captain. Half the plasma relays have reversedpolarity. I'm trying, but it's not cooperating. Now. We've got a hell of a mess down here, Captain. It's going to be a whilebefore I can even figure out what just happened. Let's try it again. Watch that intermix ratio. Looking good. Bring her up to forty percent. Shut it down. Shut it down! Could be better. Creating a stable warp field isn't easy whenthe laws of physics won't cooperate. The Cochrane Equation, it's notconstant here. The problem's in the quantum variables. Every time I tryto compensate, the spatial gradients get thrown out of whack. Either weget away from these anomalies or we're going to have to rewrite thebook on warp theory, and I don't have to tell you how long it tookZefram Cochrane the first time around. Weapons should be up and running within an hour or two. You worried about something? Now where's Isaac Newton when you need him. They made off with three photonic torpedoes, a case of plasmarifles, two dozen stun grenades, Chef says they cleaned out half of thefood stores, Cargo Bay two's been stripped to the bulkheads, but that'snot the worst of it. They took every one of our antimatter storagepods. All we've got left is what's in the main reactor. Tops. After that we're out of gas. I don't think I'll be taking home a Nobel prize anytime soon. No kidding. T'Pol's been trying to help, showing me how to stimulate myneural nodes. It's not what you think. How are the weapons coming? I doubt he'll be the last. Every species we run into seems to be gunning for us. We mightas well paint a giant bulls-eye on the hull. All I'm saying is that this mission, whether it succeeds ornot, is looking like a one-way ticket all the time. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've been tracking the Osaarians' iontrail for the past four hours. There's still no sign of them. I had a little accident, Doc. I was reinstalling the deuteriuminjectors. One of them must have had a little juice left in it. I could have sworn that injector was depolarised. I guess I'mgetting a little punchy. I got a full hour last night. Well, we only had the one session. Haven't had a lot of freetime lately. What do you mean? It doesn't make me uncomfortable. I just can't afford to spendan hour every night in T'Pol's quarters. Can you just give me anotherone of those injections? They put me out like a light. All right, what have you got? What am I supposed to do with them? Maybe an hour a night with T'Pol isn't so bad."

This is a piece of the Xindiprobe that crashed on Earth. At least three of the symbols are an exactmatch. Pretty close. Less than a kilometre, but we need to have theaccess codes. Go ahead.

Even if I could, my Captain wouldnn'tbe very interested in having me back, would he. Not after I told youwhere to find him. I don't think you'd be very comfortable torturing another man. You and your crewmates are far too civilised for that. Too moral. You're obviously new to this Expanse. If you weren't, yourship's hull would be insulated with trellium-D. Do you have any ideawhat a spatial distortion can do to a ship that is not insulated withtrellium-D? What it can do to the people inside that ship? Well, my Captain's a very clever man. He has to be. When you'reforced to resort to desperate measures in order to survive, you have tobe clever. You need to know how to hide. When we entered this Expanse we were no different than you. Twomerchant ships looking for trade routes. Then the first distortion hitus. We decided to return home, but the perimeter, the thermobaricclouds, let you in but they don't let you out. One of our ships wasdestroyed trying. After a few more encounters with the anomalies itwasn't long before we became predators. This section of the Expanseproved to be ideal for hunting. When a ship runs aground due to spatialdistortions it becomes an easy target. Our Captain told us we wouldn'tharm anyone, and we didn't. Not at first. It takes time to learn tokill without remorse. You're not prepared to kill, or torture. Not yet. Xindi? I don't remember a species with that name. What manifest? It was a small ship, they were no match for us. They resisted. We had no choice. I have better things to do than familiarise myself with ourvictims. I don't remember. Your threats aren't very convincing. I told you, you're toocivilised. Are you taking me to your torture chamber? This tactic doesn't suit you, Captain. Now that I've served my purpose you're taking me back to theairlock? So you have let your morality get in the way after all. Mercyis not a quality that will serve you well in the Expanse, Captain."

It took me half the night to figure out how they map co-ordinates, butI've been able to reconstruct the ship's course over the past fewmonths. This is the last planet they visited before they were attackedby the marauders. No, but it's only a day away. We don't know they weren't. Tell Travis to set a course. What about Xindi? Any bioscans? I see it. It's definitely one of theirs. I recognise it from thedatabase. Search the area. See what else you can find. Some of their databanks may still be intact. This whole area's been scorched. Keep looking.     Enterprise. We don't know what she is. It can't be far. How long was I asleep? I saw it. In my dream, I was there. Our city. You're wrong. It's below the surface. It was filled with thousands of Loque'eque, waiting for us. Urquat's my home. When we get there you'll understand. Wait andsee. We've rested long enough. It isn't far now. The passage was here, in my dream. Help me. I saw it so clearly. There was a fountain there, and gardens upthere, floating. And there were people, thousands of people. No, no. We're not leaving. This is our home. Home, home. What about this? This body isn't ancient. Someonekilled them. Why? Who would do this? Your people? Then who? I don't belong on Enterprise. I belong here. More of your humans? Who are they? You destroyed my city, killed my people. This way. 2 Why are you firing at my ship? How are you feeling, Lieutenant? Getting there. Hoshi and T'Pol are going to take the day off. You might want to do the same. You wanted to see me? No. Those containment patrols aren't going to stop until they'vewiped out every trace of it. Now that they have your antivirus, they'llmost likely figure out a way to succeed. This was created as a final effort to preservea civilisation, a people. That species we became, they cease to existthe moment this virus is gone. We came out here to stop the Xindi destroying humanity.

Don't you recognise him? Take Lieutenant Reed back to Sickbay. I'm staying with them. Only for a few minutes. There are no cities on this planet. Your home is a planet called Earth. The people there are waitingfor you. You're on a mission to save them. Come back to Enterprise. We'll help you find out what happenedto your city. Look around. These ruins are ancient. No one has lived here fora very long time. No. I don't know, but if we go to Enterprise we can try to find out. I don't think so. We're not safe here. Come, we must go. Come,we must go. I don't know. Captain! We have to get to the surface. You said you'd never use the transporter again. Captain, you can't stay here. You'll be safe on Enterprise. COMM."
4263,ENT,episode 53,TUCKER,"Thanks for seeing me so late. You sure I'm not bothering you? Georgia peaches. I picked up a cratewhen we were back on Earth. Chef's been keeping then in stasis for me. They're as fresh as the day they were picked. Aren't you going to try one? Come on. One bite? Maybe you haven't noticed, but I've been a little busy lately. It's not like I didn't want to come back. After our last session Islept like a baby. First time in months. So, should I just Shoes? Hold on. You never said anything about feet. Well, for one thing, I haven't had a shower since this morning,and I know how sensitive that Vulcan nose of your can be. And I'm alittle ticklish. Maybe more than a little. Oh! Your hands are ice cold. You sure this is safe? I mean, has anyone ever tried it on ahuman before? That's the spot. But these aren't human. Then where's the rest of our team? The only reason I don't havea search party down there right now is because you needed more time toanalyse the data. Now unless you can give me a damn good reason to waitaround You're saying these alien biosigns could be our people. Prep shuttlepod two. We'll use EV suits and biohazard protocols. Have the Deconchamber ready when we get back. They're about three kilometres east of us. We don't have too manyoptions for a landing site. Hope you boys are up for a little walk. Keep your weapons on stun. Circle around. Chang! What about you? Sub-Commander! He didn't even recognise me. Any idea what caused this? Why did it have so little effect on T'Pol? I'm doing my best. Go ahead. Open a channel. Sorry, it wasn't very well marked. We're aware of that. Is there anything you can tell us about No one's coming aboard unless I say so. That infected organism is a member of my crew. There isn't any outbreak. Lieutenant Reed is in medicalisolation. Look, we've only been dealing with this virus for one day, soforgive me if I don't take your word for it that the only option is toneutralise our Tactical Officer. You want to come over to discuss thesituation, fine, but if you try to force your way onto this ship you'regoing to have one hell of a fight on your hands. Destroyed? Where did it come from? Why's he so eager to get back to a place called Urquat? I'd prefer to have Doctor Phlox examine them. We can't launch a shuttlepod, they'd detect it. Do you thinkT'Pol's contagious? That rules out the transporter. She'd infect the entire crew. Be right back.Â  Go ahead. Keep an eye on them. You all right? Believe me, I wish I'd had a choice. There are more of them inorbit. We'd better get back to the shuttlepod before they realiseanything's wrong. We're docking, Travis. Tell Phlox to stand by in Decon. Goto warp four as soon as we're in. Report. Try to stay ahead of them. Stand by weapons. COMM. Don't respond. Hold your course. Full power to aft hull plating. Look, we both want the same thing. A cure for this virus,right? Our doctor thinks he's found one, but he needs a little moretime Like I said, he just needed a little more time. I'm sure we'dbe happy to share the antivirus with you, but that'll be impossible ifyou destroy our ship. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've given Phlox's serum to thecaptain of the containment vessel. With any luck, he'll be able to useit to prevent future outbreaks. As for Malcolm, Hoshi and me, it may bea few days before we feel fully human again."

4271,ENT,episode 53,PHLOX,"That's a Vulcan biosign, I'm certain of it. Definitely not. When T'Pol called to the ship, she said something was happeningto them. It's possible she was speaking literally. Something on theplanet may have transformed them, physiologically. From what we've seen of the Expanse, it's a possibility we haveto consider. The laws of biochemistry on this world may be just asunpredictable as the laws of physics. I'd like a little more time to study these readings. Don't be offended. In his current condition, I doubt he'drecognise any of us. A mutagenic virus. His blood was swarming with them. It wasapparently designed to re-write the of its host, to transform anyhumanoid it infected into another species. Vulcan K-cells. They seem to neutralise the pathogen. I've beensynthesising an anti-virus using T'Pol's genetic profile, but I'm goingto need an active sample of her to complete it. We need to get herback to the ship as soon as possible. The Decon chamber's sealed. I assure you there's no danger. Ingenious, but why didn't they programme the virus to stopreplicating once their population was replenished? One of them has an immunity to the virus. If I could have accessto some of your research, perhaps we could work together. If I don't complete the antivirus within the next two hours,it'll be too late. There won't be enough of their original genome leftto resequence. Most likely. Whatever you do, Commander, do it quickly. I need that DNAsample. This is Captain Archer and Ensign Sato. They're the people younearly incinerated on that planet. As you can see, they're respondingquite well to the antivirus I synthesised. Run scans. See for yourself. This should help with the headaches. Till your digestive tract is fully restored, you may want toavoid the Mess hall. You're welcome to some of the moth larvae I feed to my Pyrithianbat. This is the last of the mutagenic virus. I assume you want me todestroy it. Captain, you experienced first-hand what this pathogen can do. Considering the alternatives, that would be best. Captain."

We've been studyingthe mutagen for sixty years. The only course of action is to neutralisethe outbreak. We won't allow your vessel to leave orbit withthe contagion aboard. You wouldn't be so confident if you knew how easily this viruscan spread. It infected tens of millions of people on my world. Theyall had to be destroyed. The virus would have transformed our entire population withinweeks. It was engineered by the inhabitants of this planet, a racecalled the Loque'eque. Something decimated their species centuries agoand they lost the ability to reproduce, so they created this virus totransform other species into their own. It was the only way to savethemselves from extinction. We've been trying to answer that question for a long time. The mutagen encodes the victims with an overpowering instinct toreturn to their home city, Urquat. That's why we can't allow even asingle infected organism to leave this planet. They can spread thecontagion to other systems and anyone who became infected would bedrawn back here. We can't risk another epidemic. Yes. Prepare a containment team. More of your crewmen?

I'm afraid we'll have to save the souvenir hunting for anothertime. Thank you. We're looking for barge twelve, a chemist namedB'Rat Ud. That's not necessary. No, thank you. Can you direct us to the chemist? I have an appointment. We met at the deuterium station onNorellus. UD You said you could sell us the formula to synthesisetrellium-D. I hope you didn't bring us all this way for nothing. UD A little pressed for time. UD We're on a diplomatic mission. UD Who? UD Commander Tucker has the list of supplies and equipment we'd bewilling to barter. As a gesture of good faith, why don't you tell mewhere we can find this merchant, then you and Mister Tucker can workout the details. B'Rat Ud said you might be able to help us.

Rajiin, you That really isn't something that I No. We'll be leaving orbit soon. Good night. Leaving so soon? We jammed your signal. Your friends can't hear you. Who are they? Takeher to the Brig. I want to talk to her. How long? Have Phlox take a look at your head. Who were youtrying to contact? I asked you a question. What did you do to T'Pol? Who are you? That's right. Kidnapped when you were a child, sold into a lifeof slavery, and it was just a coincidence that you happened to escapewhen I was at that market. The chemist knew I was looking forinformation about the Xindi. Is that why you showed up so conveniently? Care to be a little more specific? Who, the Xindi? How do you know I won't do the same? Tell me who you contacted. Who! Go ahead. Hull plating to full power, stand byweapons. The Reptilian species. They're the ones who sent you. I assume they're here for you. Forgive me if I don't take your word on that, but they murderedseven million people on my planet! Go ahead. Seal that airlock and post security teams. I'm on my way. What was your mission? About what? We know that. Go on. Where are they building the weapon? When will it be ready? Get a security detail down here. No one's taking heranywhere. They're heading for the Brig. Try to cut them off. You're with me. Archer to the Bridge. Don't let those ships get away. Lay in a pursuit course. I want a complete autopsy, Doctor, and have Malcolm take thisweapon apart. I want to find out it's range, power output and how wecan defend against it. Are you okay? Good, because I want an analysis of the scans we took of thoseXindi ships, and find out what you can about that vortex they wentthrough. I don't want them dropping in unannounced again. Dismissed."

UD Bridge to Captain Archer. Two vessels are approaching from aft. Sir, The biosigns match the genetic profile ofthe Xindi pilot who attacked Earth. Bridge to the Captain. The smaller ship is approaching the starboard docking port. Three boarding parties, at least five men each."

Is there a problem? You said this was helping you sleep. Then why do you want to stop? And that disturbs you. I see no reason to be concerned with idle gossip. We're both senior officers. If we were pursuing a romanticrelationship it wouldn't be Lieutenant Reed's concern, would it? Shall we continue? It'll require extremely precise calculations but I believeMister Tucker and I can synthesise the compound safely. I recommend we set up a lab on E deck, within the emergencybulkheads, as a precaution. Up to eleven hundred units. The pressure's still rising. Fourteen hundred units. Fourteenthirty. No effect. We should seal off this section and leave. It might not. We should evacuate. It's not working. The pressure is up to two thousand units. Commander! Some of our calculations may have been slightlyoff. We've been working for six hours. I suggest we take a break. Come to my quarters in half an hour. We'll resume yourneuro-pressure regimen. I prefer you are rested before we make another attempt. I know who you are. What are you doing here? That's not likely. Perhaps you are unfamiliar with our protocols, but it isunacceptable for you to be in my quarters uninvited. I'm afraid Vulcans and humans are allies. Now please leave. What are youdoing? I need you to leave. Stop. No! Yes."
4515,ENT,episode 54,TUCKER,"You could go a little harder. Mmm, perfect. Try that neckthing. What'd you call it? Yeah, that one. Don't worry, I've been practicing my breathing. T'Pol. You know, I really need to talk to you about something. No. No, no, I mean, this feels great, and I really appreciateyou taking the time. It's just, I'm not sure we should be doing itanymore. It has. People are talking. About us. About me coming to your quartersat night. They think there's more going on than neuro-pressure. It shouldn't, I know, but Malcolm and I were purging a cloggedinjector assembly only last week and he asked me why I didn't justmassage it with my magic fingers. It doesn't bother you? I suppose not. Phlox would have a field day here. And expensive? UD I'm confident we can agree on a fair price. How can you walk away from such beauty? On our planet, wars were fought over these. Careful. UD Black pepper. There's paprika, mustard seed. I'm partial to thecayenne myself. I'm sure you'll find these all very exotic. Then all we need is the recipe. UD Or? UD Tucker to Captain Archer. We're in business, sir. Enough to do some serious damage if we screw this up. It's only volatile in it's liquid form. Once we apply it to theinner hull and it sets, it's completely safe. The tricky part's cookingit up in the first place. What's the molecular pressure? Boy, this stuff is tricky. Decrease the theta bombardment bysix, no, seven percent. Damn it. Kill the theta radiation altogether. A sustained burst of delta radiation might do the trick. I'm going to ramp the delta at eighty percent. You're welcome to leave. We're back to square one. I can't argue with that. I'll be fine. Tucker to the Bridge. Could you tell me where T'Pol is? Tucker to Security. I'll be fine. What happened to her? What kind of species is born with a suicide gland? Aye sir."

The soonerthe ship is insulated against these phenomena the happier I will be. Of course. Have you had any other symptoms? You were transformed into a different species. Don't expect torecover overnight. You have the most intriguing eyes. I'venever seen a retinal structure this complex. I'm not familiar with her species, but she appears to be inperfect health. Of course. You should let me run a neural scan. I can't even begin to speculate. She's suffered disruptionsthroughout her neocortex. If she were human, or Denobulan for thatmatter, she'd probably be dead. But Vulcan neurophysiology is a greatdeal more resilient than ours. I have to finish treating her injuries first. A few hours.

You were very eager to learn about theXindi, as I recall. What is your interest in them? A diplomatic mission. Some Xindi arrived here last week. Ithought you might be interested. They had business with another merchant. I'd be happy to direct you, for a small fee. What's this one called? Of course. I've reviewed your engineering specifications. Youappear to have the necessary equipment to produce liquid trellium-D. Trellium can only be synthesised in a liquid state. It's justas effective as the natural ore. There is one thing.

The two I saw looked reptilian, and they weren'tvery pleasant. At the time, I was just relieved they weren't interestedin me. Why are you looking for them? Good evening, Captain. I'm sorry to disturb you. I hoped you might have time to talk. I was taken away when I was very young. I don't remember muchabout it, and I doubt anyone there would remember me. I'm very grateful for what you've done, Captain. I want torepay you for your kindness. I know. There's a reason I was taken from my home. I have certaingifts. Would you like me to show you? It's all right. Captain, is something wrong? Well, I just wanted to say thank you again. Good night. The Captain said it was all right if I left my quarters. I'mRajiin. It's a pleasure to meet you.

Try to let go. Better. Let go. I need assistance. I have what you want. I can use their transporter device butyou'll need to be within ten thousand kilometres. Is there something wrong? There's no need to bother the Captain. So do I. Are you in range? Respond. I'm sorry. I can't answer it. She shouldn't have resisted. I told you. My name is Rajiin. The only thing I can tell you is that you're in danger. If I say anything else, they'll kill me. It's true that I deceived you, but that didn't make yourdecision to help me any less admirable. I don't want to see you harmed,Captain. The best thing for you to do is let me go. I had no choice. They won't harm anyone if you let me go. They wanted information. About you. They're building a weapon. This is different. A bio-weapon. They need data about your species before they can begin. I don't know. I don't know. They didn't tell me anything else.

But you are my Science Officer. I need to know I can depend onyou. You don't know that. We're getting you off this ship. We're going to take the scans you made back to Phlox and figureout what's going on here, but first we have to get to the shuttle. Howdo you open those bulkheads? The bulkheads. Okay. T'Pol, we have to keep moving. We'll go deal with them. Stay with her, Hawkins. Any more where they came from? Archer to Hawkins. We're all clear. Secure the door. Any chance of repairing it? T'Pol. Any chance of repairing it. Trip, We're going to need some help getting off this ship. How fast can yoube here? It's the Vulcan crew. Something's wrong with them. We're going to transmit some biodata. Tell Phlox to start analysing it. See if there's anything we can do tohelp these people. Just get that shuttle flying. Archer out. You okay? Then we'll have to try something else. What are you talking about? No one's trying to sabotage your work. We should all just focuson getting off this ship safely. I don't think we have much of a choice. Give me the weapon. Listen to me. This is a rescue mission. We're here to savethese people. If that's true, then why would I keep our weapons on stun? It'snot logical. Is it too late? What about the Vulcan crew? Phlox, do you read me? Doctor, there are over a hundred and forty people on this ship. Enterprise. Phlox, do you hear me? Respond. Shut it off. After you initiate the overload, how long do we have? You heard what the Doctor said. They can't be saved, but youcan. Help me get her out of here. Malcolm? Come on. Climb! Malcolm! You can't stay here. Watch her. Reed. Come on, you can make it. It's okay, I'll help you. I can't release the docking clamps. Full power to thrusters. The docking clamps are jammed. We could use a hand. The ship's about to blow. Get the hell out of here. Archer to shuttlepod two. Are you still in one piece? It may be a while before Phlox finds a way to inoculate T'Pol. Take this to Cargo bay one. Store it in the biohazard locker. How'd it go? I'd like to talk with her. Phlox was able to help you. You're going to be okay. It was destroyed. I'm sorry, but I didn't have a choice. Yes and no. He collected a good supply of trellium, but itturns out it was trellium that poisoned the Vulcan crew and you. I'm not going to do that. We'll find a way through this, but I won't leave anyone behind. Not if I can help it. I can't try to save humanity without holding onto what makes me human. All hands report to stations. Tactical alert."

They were lining this bulkhead with trellium. Theydidn't get very far. Vulcan blood. Go ahead sir. Not yet. Aye, sir. What happened to them? Captain. What are they doing? Seven. How many Vulcans are on board? If I'm not mistaken, the launch bay's on this level. Maybe we canuse one of their shuttles. He's losing a lot of blood, Captain. We've got to treat thiswound. Two more biosigns fifty metres beyond that hatch. It's the onlyway to the Engineering deck. Five metres. Not at the moment. Sir, I've encrypted the locking codes, but if they're determinedto get in. They've all been realigned. I realigned the circuits, just like you asked me. There might be another way, sir. If we overload the power grid,it would disrupt the systems all over the ship including the bulkheadmechanisms. Sir, that pistol's set to kill. They've shut the comm. system down. I can't. They've bypassed the environmental controls. About fifteen minutes, maybe less. Just about there. We don't have much time. Another twenty metres. How were you at the long jump. Go. I said, go! What's wrong?"

OneDay Earlier Captain. I would have helped you do that. Not at the moment. Movie night? I recognise the transponder frequency. It's the Seleya. Theyentered the Expanse nine months ago. The asteroids are moving in a chaotic fashion. Their paths areunpredictable. It may be the result of some spatial anomalies. Approximately two thousand kilometres dead ahead. Starboard bow, three hundred forty metres. Twelve hundred kilometres. I could take the helm if you'd like. A great deal. I served on it for over a year. It was my lastassignment before joining the consulate on Earth. I was the deputyscience officer under Captain Voris. They were attempting to chart the thermobaric perimeter. Afterseveral days they reported that they'd become caught in some kind ofsubspace eddy and were being pulled into the Expanse. It was theirfinal transmission. The Vankaara was sent to find them. You alreadyknow what happened to that crew. Directly ahead, two hundred metres. I'm reading multiple biosigns. The starboard docking port is still intact. I'm reading biosigns on this deck. I can't isolate them. One biosign. I'm fine. His synaptic pathways have beenseverely damaged. Captain! Seven more, that direction, thirty metres. What are you doing? These are Vulcan officers and we're on a rescue mission. You heard me! No. That way. If their comm. system's intact we may be able to contactEnterprise from the Bridge. Seven decks above us. Assuming the entire crew is still alive, one hundred and fortyseven. The bay's depressurised, probably from an asteroid impact. That'll be difficult. All four bulkheads leading to the airlockhave been sealed. It's two decks up. Since we've come aboard, I've been experiencing anxiety. Whatever's happened to this crew may be starting to affect me. I'm not a doctor. I'll do my best. His name is Solin. When I served here he wasthe Chief Engineer. I knew him. Can you understand me? Sub-Commander T'Pol. We served together. Don't you recognise me? We'rehere to help you but we need to know what happened to your crew. Solin,look at me. Something has made you very ill. You've lost control. Tellme what happened. Tell me! This is going tohappen to me. It's already started. I can feel my control slipping away. It's too late. There's an auxiliary control room on the Engineering deck. I don't need your help. Thank you. A common misconception. We have emotions. We simply keep themsuppressed, under control. Something has obviously caused them to losethat control. There was a time in the past when we were an extremely violentrace. We nearly destroyed ourselves. Paranoia and homicidal rage werecommon. The transceiver's been damaged. What! There's an auxiliary transmitter. If I can get access to it wemay be able to contact Enterprise. The bulkhead controls were severed on deck nine. I've rerouted themthrough the auxiliary grid. Mister Reed, are you finished with thoseactuator circuits? What did you do? These aren't sequenced correctly. Youoverloaded the locking mechanism! It's pointless. The circuits are damaged! I should have beenwatching him. You didn't want me to see. Now I know what you were doingin the Command Centre. The Xindi starcharts. You were analysing them behind my back,undermining my work. The warp reactor is unstable as it is. Disrupting main powercould shut down the anti-matter containment. You'd cause a reactorbreach. You want to kill all of us. Youdon't trust Vulcans. You never have. Don't think I've forgotten. You blamed us for holding you back,for undermining your father's work. Now you've decided to take revenge. I'll fire! You're lying. You want to kill them. He's lying. He wants them all to die. They won't let you destroy this ship. No! Murderer! No, no, no. Get away from me. Touch me and I'll kill you. The Seleya? Was Commander Tucker successful? It's essential you protect this ship. Leave me on the nexthabitable planet. You can't allow your concern for a single crewman to affect yourmission. This Expanse destroyed everyone aboard the Seleya. Don't letit happen to Enterprise. Perhaps we should watch, and find out. Then use logic more quietly."
4772,ENT,episode 55,TUCKER,"I talked with Chef at dinner. He's a little worried about the crew. People are skipping meals. He figures they're either too busy or thestress of this mission is starting to get to them. Movie night's been on hold since we entered the Expanse. Maybewe should start it up again? No one hates the Xindi more than I do, Captain, but I'm tellingyou this crew needs a little R and R. Unless you want Phlox to startmedicating people, we gotta, we've gotta find a way to boost morale. I was thinking about a comedy. One of the classic Hope andCrosby pictures. You have plans Tuesday night? Mess hall, nineteen hundred hours. Back by popular demand. I can guess why they were interested in this field. Theasteroids are loaded with trellium ore. Good isotope density. We should get at least half a kilo out ofthis one. Let's try for something biggerthis time. How about this one. Travis? Shut it down. This thing's useless. The coils are fused. They're pretty unpredictable. You sure you could land safely? This'll be a new one for the maintenance crew. This one's more isolated, and I'm reading large deposits nearthe surface. Can you set us down? You're the pilot, it's your call. Looking good. Two hundred metres. You're drifting to the left. Are you kidding? I'm going to recommend they give you a medal. Let's try to make this quick. It was minor. Nothing to write home about. Don't worry. It only tends to blow up in its liquid state. Go ahead. We saw it. Don't worry about me. Just get us the hell out of here. There's debris in the intake manifold. Can you purge it? Can you get us home? Shuttlepod two to Enterprise. We're on our way back, but we've taken damage. Alert the launch bay crew to get ready for a rough docking. Looks like the impulse assembly took a beating. Open up theengine housings and run a diagnostic. Tucker here. Route it down here. Pod two took some damage in the asteroid field, sir. We're looking at acouple of hours before we can launch again. What's the problem? Acknowledged. Anything else? Aye sir. You heard the Captain. Get a repair team down here. It doesn't make sense. T'Pol and I have been working with trellium forweeks. She hasn't shown any symptoms. Are you all right, Captain? Stand by. You're clear, sir. We're fine, sir. See you back on Enterprise. We got over sixty kilos. That should be enoughto line the forward hull. Aye, sir. No, he died in a house fire. What about the gardener? He was there too. Part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it before itends, using logic. You of all people should appreciate that."

Despite your best efforts, youweren't able to synthesis it in any significant quantities. The crew ofthe Seleya, however, had the misfortune of wandering into an asteroidfield filled with the compound. Trellium-D is a potent neurotoxin tothe Vulcan nervous system. It disrupts the synaptic pathways that allowthem to control emotions. Unfortunately the rate of decay isaccelerating. I can treat her, but I nee to begin synaptic regenerationas soon as possible. I'm afraid there's nothing we can do for the others. They've been exposed for too long. The neurological damage isirreversible. They're dying, Captain. I'm sorry, but they've been exp You got her out in time, Captain. Her synaptic pathways aremending nicely, but it will be a few days before she fully regainscontrol of her emotions. They were beyond help. Their fate was sealed long before wearrived. Please don't be long. Something tells me we haven't seen the last of the detective inthe bow tie. Ah, did he? The autopsy was inconclusive. I wouldn't besurprised if the body belonged to the delivery man with the strangelimp. You never did see him leave the house. Too tall. Even the primitive forensics of the mid-twentiethcentury would have determined that. It's all right. You're on Enterprise.

5017,ENT,episode 56,ARCHER,"I thought I was the only one who lived here during my off hours. Seems pretty random. A second sphere. If you're right, then we should be able to start predictingwhere we're going to run into trouble. Assuming there is a second sphere, how far away is it? Set a course. You have to admit it's a possibility. I want you to keep Hoshi under observation until we can sortthis out. Post a security detail outside, and assign teams toEngineering and the Armoury until further notice. Around here, you never know. I'll see you both in the morning. What did he tell you about the Xindi? He could have given you something as a show of good faith. Thiscould be another attempt by the Xindi to infiltrate Enterprise. Archer to Mayweather. We're taking a slight detour. The Captain's always a part of first contact missions. StarFleet regulations. I hope that's not a problem. You said you could help us with our mission. I can arrange to have something sent down. How much time wouldyou need with it? We'll be back as soon as we can. I'm afraid that's not appropriate. My instincts tell me otherwise. He's hiding something. We think it was a prototype. From a much larger weapon. Do I have to tell you to stay on your toes? Did you bring a phase pistol? You know how to reach me. Archer to the Bridge. I assume we're getting close? Take us out of warp. I'm on my way. Status. I got you. All stop! The anomalies are strongerhere. Which means if we continue, there's a good chance the ship isgoing to get torn apart. If it is there, how far? Bridge to Commander Tucker. How are your engines Holding up? How long would it take you to insulate a shuttlepod with trellium-D. Get started. Hold our position. You might want to steer clear ofthe Launch bay for the next couple of days. No anomalies. Archer to Enterprise. We're approaching seventy nine thousand kilometres. Still nosign Of the cloaking barrier. Stand by. I think we've found it. Hull integrity? Trip. Let's get going withthe scans. Is there a problem? How much time do you need? Bring the descent thrusters online. Thrusters, Trip, and get the EV suits ready. Get to work. I'm going to take a look around. How's it coming, Trip? What happened? I can see that. Can we launch without a port thruster? Whoever gets the first clear shot. Archer to Enterprise. It was right where you said it was, T'Pol. We got all thescans you asked for. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. While T'Pol analyses the data from thesphere, we set a course to pick up Ensign Sato and find out if thealien learned anything about the Xindi. How was your stay? I'm sure. If it's any consolation, your time here was wellspent. We've learnt more about the Xindi than I expected, and he'soffered to keep supplying us with information for as long as we're inrange, thanks to you. There is one condition. He wants you to stay with him while hecontinues his work. I won't order you to do this, Hoshi, but it may be our bestchance of finding the weapon before it's too late. With any luck, it'llonly take a few weeks, maybe a month. We'd come back for you as soon asthe mission's over. I don't need to tell you what's at stake, Ensign. Thank you, Hoshi. There's no reason for you to leave. Just giveme a list of what you need and I'll have it sent down. We'll take care of it. Don't worry. I wish there was time. I'm sure Travis will understand. Travis and the others. They realise how important this is. We've known each other a long time. We'll be back for you as soon as we can. Hoshi. Hoshi. Open a channel to Ensign Sato. COMM. What's going on? Report. Malcolm. Tactical alert. Put her through. We are now. What the hell's going on? What have you got? Nearly? The waves aren't intersecting where they're supposed to. A third sphere? How many? Fifty man-made spheres, each one the size of a small moon. Did it ever occur to you that whoever built these things mayhave done it to create the Expanse? Come in. I thought I told you to get somerest. I was afraid that might happen. What are they for?"

I went through all the logs for the last twenty four hours. Tosay they were uneventful would be an understatement. This is good news. You're a little on edge. It's not uncommon to see the enemy outof the corner of your eye. Whatever it is, it's not uncommon. Just the other night I thoughtI heard clicking sounds in my quarters. For a moment, I could havesworn there was a Xindi Insectoid lurking in the shadows. All right, I'll keep an eye out. Hoshi. You all right? We still haven't found any ships nearby or any uninvited guestson board. Are you expecting an attack, sir? Why? We didn't pick up any other biosigns. I take it you live herealone. It's an awfully big planet for one person. If he's insistent, we could put off looking for the sphere, stayin orbit. It's only for a few days. We're losing structural integrity in the forward hull. It might as well be seventy five thousand light years. Sir. My station's down. Weapons are coming back online. Aye, sir. COMM."

5028,ENT,episode 56,T'POL,"I'd like you to see this. These are the locations where we'veencountered spatial anomalies. I analysed the sensor logs from theXindi database. These are the co-ordinates where that vessel wasaffected. That's what I thought, until I ran a vector analysis of thegravimetric waves coming from the sphere we discovered. Theinterference patterns implied another wave source. It appears so. The simulation suggests that the anomalies occurwhere the waves intersect. If we're going to create an accurate map, we'll need precisemeasurements of the sphere's gravimetric fields. Less than four light years. Yes, Captain. You assume correctly. Yes, sir. We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks. Breaches on decks B, C and E. Emergency bulkheads are in placebut three subsections have decompressed. If there is another sphere in the region, it's emitting a lotmore gravimetric energy than the first one. Approximately seventy five thousand kilometres. Indeed. Go ahead. Adjust your heading to oh one six mark two. I believe you just grazed the perimeter. Turn starboard three point sixdegrees. Maintain course. You should be heading directly towards thecloaking barrier. We're here, Captain. Everything's going offline. Main and auxiliary power, warpengines, life support. Power's returning to all systems. The data you collected allowed me to create a nearly accuratemap of the anomalies. These are the coordinates where we've encountered stronganomalies. Exactly. The locations are being influenced by more than twogravimetric sources. A third sphere would correct some of the error but not all ofit, so I had the computer run a covariant extrapolation. We'll need to get farther into the Expanse to be certain, but,at least fifty. And each one generating massive amounts of gravimetric energy. Why would someone want to create a web of crippling anomalies?"
5029,ENT,episode 56,TUCKER,"Go ahead. So far, so good, but I wouldn't recommend putting them througha lot more of this. I'd need a day to refine enough ore and at least twelve hours To reconfigure the hull. Aye, sir. Sensors say we're passing through a gravimetric distortion. Trellium seems to be doing it's job. That felt promising. Power's fluctuating. Some microfractures, but nothing we can't handle. Switching to backup. Ah, hell. The sensor relays were damaged. Not long, but we'll have to get back to Enterprise. I need toopen up the circuit housings on the undercarriage. No way to get tothem from the inside. You're not planning to land on that thing? Not exactly my idea of shore leave. Don't get lost. Almost there, sir. Just two more relays. Captain! The port thruster ignited. When I was bypassing the last relay, I must have triggered asurge in the propulsion system. Son of a bitch! It's going to be a long time beforeEnterprise decides to come looking for us. We can sure as hell try. Careful, sir. That was awfully close to the O2 recycler. I need to spend more time in the Armoury."

There's no evidence of any mind-altering substances on board. It appears to be. I suppose you believe you're dealing badly with stress. Well, that's a matter of opinion. On Denobula, when a personunder stress hallucinates it's considered healthy. A harmless way forthe subconscious to release nervous energy. I've always envied thosewho had that facility. I tend to keep too much bottled up inside. I'm not picking up anything out of the ordinary. I'll take care of it after I get you settled. Be my guest. The Vulcan root-leaf's in that container. It makes perfect sense. Listening to your thoughts has been verypleasurable. I've been with you for several days. Studying your mind, yourmemories. Learning so many things about you. My telepathy only works in rare instances. It takes a uniquemind to process it. Yours is the first I've found in many years."

5039,ENT,episode 56,HOSHI,"Hello? Ensign Sato to Security. Nothing? Maybe our sensors missed something. That I'm imagining things? I thought that was called paranoia. What I saw wasn't a shadow. Are there any more tests that you can run? The last few days I've had the strangest feeling that I am beingwatched. I've heard whispering down corridors, in my quarters. Could Ihave been exposed to something that's making me hallucinate? So basically this is all in my head. Great. It's not a good sign when you start to see things that aren'tthere. I should get going. T'Pol's asked me to translate a section ofthe Xindi database. Ensign Sato to Lieutenant Reed. I need help in the CommandCentre. Who are you? How did you get on board? What do you want? I am not imagining it, Captain. With respect, sir, I know that my mind can be overactivesometimes, but that is not what's happening. This is real. Isn't it about feeding time? Would you mind? I'm really not that tired. That's strange. It's. Whenthe alien communicates with me, it's almost like he's inside my head,looking at things through my eyes, experiencing what I'm experiencing,and talking to him is like talking to myself. Does that make any sense? What? Why me? What do you want? I don't think that'll be possible. He's saving that for my visit. I think he wants to help. He was horrified that seven million ofus were killed. He says he's willing to use his abilities to help usfind the Xindi. I think that's reason enough to meet with him. If I'm comfortable with this. I don't get the sense that he would harmme. We don't have the luxury of dealing with one problem at a timeanymore, sir. If he can tell us something about the Xindi weapon it'sworth the risk. I can take care of myself, Captain. Thanks. I need a minute. I think that falls under the goes without saying category, sir. I'll keep it under my pillow. Do you always eat like this? Thank you. You have certainly done your homework. What's this? You know, my stomach is a little unsettled. Since you seen to know so much about my past, I think it's onlyfair that I know a little about yours. Where are you from? What do you mean? Are you reading my mind continuously? This is great, but I'm pretty tired. I'm sure there's enough to keep me occupied. Thank you. I won't, I'll be busy with this. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm about halfway through. Aren't you supposed to know me better than that? It's an interesting language, reminds me of medieval Klingon. Any progress? That's what we've heard. Do you know where they're building the weapon? What's this? Is that possible?Â TARQUIN I think so. How do you make sense of allthat? Maybe later. I should let you get back to your work. Thanks. Is this why you didn't want me out here? Who are they? How did they die? How old are you? Who were they? And the other three? You're right. We should go back inside. You know that Enterprise is on an important mission. I justcan't abandon my duties. Do you really expect me to spend the rest of my life on adesolate world with someone I have known for less than two days? I am grateful for your help and I'm happy to stay here while youwork, but I have no intention of becoming your next companion. If you think projecting yourself as human is going to make mechange my mind, you're mistaken. You obviously misinterpreted a few memories, because thissituation is very different. I don't need you to help me do that. I already told you, I'm not interested. What I'm thinking is none of your business! Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Thank you for all your help. I can't stay here, you know that. The next time you invite someone for a visit, you might want tolet them know you're looking for a life-long companion. I was hoping you'd say that. I'm nearly done, and I'm anxious tosee how it ends. It'll be good to get back to Enterprise. Glad I could help, sir. I assume you told him that wouldn't be possible. I'll go back to my quarters and pick up a few things. I should brief my replacement on the UT upgrades. At least give me a chance to say goodbye to the crew! It won't take long. Sir, I might not see my friends again. Travis? I was just thinking about Travis. You're a regular mind reader. Where is Captain Archer? Where is he? Where is Captain Archer! Nice try. What were you planning to tell my Captain when he got back? Were you going to appear as me and beg him to let me stay? No, youcan't do that, can you? I'm the only one on board that you can playyour tricks with. What is that supposed to mean? What's happened to Enterprise? Let me speak to Captain Archer. Why the hell not? Why can't I speak to Captain Archer? You would kill over eighty people to keep me here? I'm counting on that. Now, undo whatever you've done to my shipor you will never contact anyone again with this thing. As long as I'm with you. Another sixty, seventy years, and thenwhat. What'll you do when I'mgrave number five out there? Without this you will never find anothercompanion. You will be alone for the rest of your life. This is your last chance. Captain, are you all right? I think it's time to come get me. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Ensign Sato has returned toEnterprise, but without any new information on the Xindi. I'm hopingT'Pol's analysis of the second sphere will bring better news. What are you doing here? You can't do this. I don't want you watching me. Why now? He came to my quarters. He gave me these coordinates. A Xindi colony. He said they're building part of the weaponthere. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

5272,ENT,episode 56,TARQUIN,"Hoshi. Do you understand me? I think you do. Can you see me? Hoshi. That's where I'm waiting for you. That's where I'm waiting for you. Hoshi. Don't be frightened. Hoshi. I'm nowhere near your ship. You're searching for something. I can help. I'm only three light years away. My home is what you're seeingright now. All I want is to meet you. I know you're on an urgent mission. That's what I want to talkto you about. I asked Hoshi to come alone. Not at all, Captain. I'm pleasedall three of you could come. My name is Tarquin. I'm obviously not whatyou expected. I didn't want to frighten you, so I created a human imagewhen I contacted you on Enterprise. Thank you for coming to me. You're searching for a weapon that could annihilate yourplanet. I may be able to find it, but I'll need an object that'sassociated with the Xindi. Every artifact retains an imprint of the people who made it,who used it. I have the ability to sense those imprints. No more than a few days. Alone. I've lived here for a very long time, Mister Reed. My onlycontact with the outside world has been through telepathy. Bring me theartefact. I'd like to get started. Captain, one small request. I'd like Hoshi to stay with mewhile I'm working. Nonetheless, it's a condition of my helping you. This is from the weapon that attacked your planet. This will be very useful. May I? Take your time. Only when I have company. I thought you might enjoy something familiar. Programming these disheswas a challenge. I had to recreate their tastes and textures from yourmemory. Please. It should approximate the recipefrom Fiorella's on Fountain Street in San Francisco. I've enjoyed it. Dessert. It's a delicacy from theArakon system. I think you'll like it. You told your grandmother that every time she tried to serveyou soba noodles. Now it's one of your favourite foods. My homeworld is thirty light years from here. A wonderfulplace to live, provided you're not born telepathic. The odds are one infifty million. I was among the unlucky few. We're considered a threatto the rest of the population. There's only one solution for peoplelike me. To live out our lives in exile. So we're sent to places likethis. To solitude. I think you're familiar with it. Your parents learned you were gifted, so you spent yourchildhood with private tutors, studying languages. You thought it wasnormal to go through your days alone. I'm sorry, I forget you'reunaware of how much I know about you. Not since you arrived. Now that you're here with me I wouldrather get to know you the way other humans do. Of course. If you need anything else, let me know at supper tomorrow. I'll be working most of the day. Feel free to wander. There are a lotof interesting things here, but I strongly suggest that you stayinside. The winds can be treacherous. If you'd like, you could spend some time looking at this. It'swritten in a dead language, over a thousand years old. Everything aboutthese people, their homeworld, their culture, has vanished into time. You don't have to feel alone. That's not what I meant. You often feel isolated, even aroundother people. You don't have to. Not at all. Please. Have you had a chance to look at the book I gaveyou? I didn't expect you to translate it so quickly. What did you think of it? A few images, impressions. Did you know that there are fiveXindi species? There's a great deal of conflict among them. They don't trustone another. Not yet. I'm going to need more time. It helps me extend the range of my telepathy. My family gaveit to me when I was exiled. Without it, I never would have found you. Would you like to try? If you close your eyes, you begin to sense light and colour. Let theimages take shape. Let the shapes become more distinct. Can you seethem? You're trying too hard to find them. Let the images come toyou. It takes practice. Try again. Feel free to return, if you'd like some company. I asked you to stay inside! They're people I knew. The last one died over a century ago. We should go inside. Very few lifespans are as long as mine. I was born over four hundred years ago. The first one was Morianna Taal. She was my first companion. Like you, she had a unique mind. Companions as well. When I lost Morianna I began to search foranother, then another. Sometimes I don't know what is worse, beingalone or having to bury the people I've come to care about. It's beenmany years since I found someone like you. All I'm asking is that you consider the possibility. It's possible that with my help your mission will be oversoon. The others had similar doubts, but over time they came toappreciate what I had to offer them. No one will ever understand youthe way I can. You've let your fear of the unknown stand in your way far toomany times. You almost left Enterprise early in it's mission becauseyou didn't think you could control your fears. But in spite of that,you stayed. It strengthened you. This situation is no different. I'm giving you the chance to experience something you'vesearched for your entire life. It's the reason you study languages, tomake unique connections with people. Then why do you seem so isolated? You live on a ship filledwith your own people and yet there are many times when you feel alone. Stay with me. I'll teach you ways of sharing thoughts and emotions nohuman can. You're lying, Hoshi. I can hear everything you're thinking. Michio. Your grandfather. He's the last person you were trulyclose to, but he died a long time ago. You can have that kind of connection again. I'm sorry. I know this must seem overwhelming. Think aboutwhat I've said. You're going to have a great deal of time. May I come in? I won't be long. I just heard from yourCaptain. Enterprise will be here in a few minutes. I have learned agreat deal about the Xindi weapon. I'm sure he'll find the informationuseful. Have you given any more thought to my offer? I understand. I was foolish to think it was even apossibility. I won't forget. Please keep the book as a reminder of yourtime here. After I've briefed Captain Archer, I'll send him to you. Itwas a privilege knowing you. Enterprise has already returned. Their fate in in your hands. I can't let you leave, Hoshi. I've waited too long to findyou. If you agree to stay, they won't be harmed. They'll be free toleave orbit. That's not possible. You'll be happy here, I promise you. There's no power on your vessel, and there won't be until youagree to remain with me. I don't want to kill anyone. That's why it's essential thatyou agree to stay. You mustn't dothat. It's very fragile. An empty threat, Hoshi. As long as you're with me I won't needto contact anyone else. Please, think of what I can offer you. Did you enjoy the ending? This is the last time, I promise. I've brought you informationto give to your Captain. You're on a dangerous mission. I don't want to see you harmed. Who knows, you may change your mind about me someday."

5275,ENT,episode 57,ARCHER,"Previously on Star Trek Enterprise. Where are they for? We've seen how different Xindi technology is. They could have defences we can't detect. What about these energy readings? They could be coming from a weapons complex. Or a glitch in our sensors. I know. But if there's any chance that something on that planet could lead us to the Xindi weapon, we have to investigate it. After we enter the system we'll stay on the far side of that moon. It should keep us out of view. Tell Major Hayes he'll be joining us on a reconnaissance mission. We launch in two hours. Archer to Enterprise. I've found a landing site twelve kilometres north of the energy readings. Any sign they've detected us? I've set a steep approach vector and we've ionised the hull. It'll help disburse any scanning beams. How much further? They're Xindi. No, one of the other species we saw on the database. We've picked up readings across the spectrum. Positron emissions, antiproton bursts. Whatever they're doing in there, it's using a lot of power. Tell him to keep standing by. I'm not ready to send in the troops just yet. We've checked out the perimeter of the complex. I think we can get inside without being detected. We'll maintain communications silence inside the complex. I'll contact you at oh four hundred. Archer out. What about people? I need an analysis as soon as possible. That might set them back for a while, but we can't lose sight of our main objective. I want to know where they're shipping this kemocite. It could lead us to the weapon. I have some questions for you. Sit down! Take watch outside. What's your name? My name's Jonathan Archer. I'm from Earth. Tell me about kemocite. Used for what? You're working with someone named Degra. Who is he? What's he using it for? Maybe you should, because this batch is being used to create a weapon to exterminate my people! I want to know where the weapon is being build and when it's going to be ready. I'm not leaving here until I get the answers I need. Not yet, but this should help. Go ahead. We'll contact you in a couple of hours. I thought we were here to try and stop a war, not start one. Because they were told we're going to attack them. They think they're acting in self-defence. By destroying this complex we'll be confirming their worst fears about humanity. Have Major Hayes lay down blast suppressors. When this facility goes, I don't want to take the rest of the settlement with it. I'll deal with Gralik when the time comes. I don't intend to let anyone know we were here. You said you weren't involved in building weapons. Explain this. It's a fragment of a probe that murdered seven million people. The dead pilot was Xindi, the alloy is Xindi, and it's imprinted with the quantum signature of the compound you produce here. We know you're constructing a larger version of the weapon, big enough to destroy a planet. I want to know where it's being built! Did it come from this facility? Is Degra a reptilian? I met one at a mining complex. We've run into a few of them, too. It's hard to imagine five sentient species evolving on the same planet. No, thanks. No, go ahead. Gone? We found some debris. How did it happen? The other five species did survive. From what I can tell, they don't all live on remote colonies like this one. I'll be right back. It's okay. Archer. Reptilians. Recognise anyone? What makes you say that? That could be dangerous. How do I know you won't expose us, tell them about Enterprise? Archer. What is it? Reptilians? Stay with him. Take cover. Let's hope they didn't get a very good look at us. Understood. I appreciate your concern. But we still have a few loose ends to tie up down here. Archer out. Anything? Let's hope so. No sign of the reptilians. I've been considering another option. The people in this colony had nothing to do with the attack on my planet. I'll be damned if I'm going to make them pay for it. You offered to help us. Are you still willing? Then we'll give them their kemocite, but it won't be exactly what they ordered. Make sure he gets home safely. Good luck. Go ahead. Are you speaking freely as well, Major? Noted. He said he'd help us. I believe him. Tell the Armoury to hold off on those spatial charges. There's been a change of plans. I'll let you know in a couple of hours. Right now, I have an assignment for you and Hoshi. We've got it. Understood. Acknowledged. Understood. Archer to Enterprise. What's the status of that Xindi ship? Are you picking up the tracking signal? Keep an eye on it. We'll be as soon as we can. Thank you. Is something wrong? I promise you, you haven't. Please trust me. Eventually, Degra's going to discover that you sabotaged his kemocite. He'll come back here. Their ship entered an energy portal after it left orbit. We've lost our tracking signal. I'd better get back to Enterprise. I will. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek Â® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

If anyone sees us, they'll think we're a meteor. Eight hundred metres, just over that rise. That's definitely the source of the energy readings. I'm not picking up any security devices. Approximately eighty inside the complex, but not within a hundred metres. Captain. Some kind of radiolytic compound. It doesn't match anything in our database. There's several hundred kilograms n this room. Captain, this place obviously has something to do with the weapon. It seems to me the sooner we put it out of commission, the better. There's nobody else here, sir. Apparently he lives alone. Congratulations, sir. Three months ago we entered the Expanse with no idea who these Xindi were or how to find them, and now we're about to destroy one of their weapons facilities. They struck first. Let's not forget the seven million people who were killed. What about Gralik, sir? He'll tell them about Enterprise. The reptilians seem rather upset about something. Captain, there are two Xindi biosigns heading this way. Captain. They've gone. Just because you didn't show up for work? Someone's closing on our position, sir. Four hundred metres. I'm not certain. Three hundred and fifty metres. Still closing, sir. Two hundred metres, one fifty. They're bloody fast, whoever they are. No, sir. We just might have stopped those bloodhounds before they transmitted our position. Permission to speak freely? I'm not sure it was wise to let him go. There are two of them, loading containers. They're heading back. Reed to Enterprise. The Captain's inside the Xindi shuttle. Captain, three Xindi have just come out of the complex. We've run into a small problem. Stand by."

Scans are still negative. Your signal's breaking up. Acknowledged. Corporal Hawkins is standing by with an assault team. We have it, Captain. Acknowledged. I managed to identify a sub-quantum imprint. It matches the signature of the Xindi probe. Have you learnt anything from the interrogation? Understood. He was quite insistent. He said he needed it to help prove a point. Captain, we've detected a ship approaching the planet. The hull configuration matches the Xindi vessel that attacked us. Are you sure this is wise? Still, it might be prudent to find a more suitable environment to test it. What about radiation or particle disbursement? You know nothing about this device. Let me know when you're ready. What's wrong? What's that? The energy levels are increasing. It's overloading. If you remove the power cell The Xindi ship is still in orbit. We haven't detected any other vessels. Captain, if the Xindi have detected your presence, I strongly urge you to return to the ship. Is everything all right? Go ahead. Acknowledged. Lieutenant Reed, report. Go ahead. Acknowledged."
5287,ENT,episode 57,TUCKER,"There's no doubt about it, Captain. This isotope was used in the weapon that attacked Earth. Something else, Captain. I ran a scan on that rifle we picked up. There it was again, the same quantum imprint. I'd like permission to take it apart. I can't imagine what the Captain wants this for. We ran the quantum analysis three times. Doesn't he trust us? My scans of this thing showed organic components, and I figured anything biological is more your turf than mine. What do you think? Is it alive? You got something? You said you had good news, Doc? You're trying to make it sick? If we rig up portable EM emitters we can knock out reptilian weapons before any of them get the chance to pull the trigger. It's still a place to start. Great work, Doc. Keep at it. I'll keep that in mind. That's good, right there. That's four inches of solid duranium. If this thing can blast a hole through it then we're in even worse trouble than we thought. We don't have time to go looking for some deserted asteroid if that's what you mean. I've rigged up four of Malcolm's force field emitters. They'll contain any blast debris. That's the point. Those Xindi took out half of our security force when they came aboard. Now, if we don't start making some progress understanding their weapons, we won't stand a chance in hell of beating them when the time comes. Give us an hour. Ready, Doc? It won't fire. I don't understand. Looks like some kind of countdown. I can't shut it down. Damn thing's booby-trapped. It'll just grow back. You were right. We probably should have found a nice, empty asteroid to test it on."

Wouldn't make a very good pet but, definitely organic. And it appears to have reproductive capabilities. I've been running scans of the weapons organic component. It's neural pathways appear to help modulate the rifle's power output. It's the most sophisticated example of biomechanical engineering I've ever seen. Ah, yes. I've been attempting to break down this creature's immune system. However, it's proving to be quite resilient. I tried an array of viruses and pathogens, but it's immune to all of them. Then I began exposing it to various radioactive spectra. A sustained burst of delta radiation. In theory. Unfortunately, the amount of radiation required would be extremely hazardous to any humans in the area. And, Commander, I'd avoid exposing any of the Xindi technology to omicron radiation. It seems to thrive on it, as you can see. If I may? Commander Tucker and I have learnt all we can from examining the workings of the device. A practical test is the next logical step. Ready. Perhaps it has a safety device. It's coming from the weapon. Quick thinking, Commander."

Without his analysis I can't proceed. 2 If you saw the drone, you knew we were here. Why didn't you return? What are you doing? Finish quickly. We appreciate your efforts. Perhaps.

5531,ENT,episode 57,SLOTH,We found a ruptured seal in the tertiary processing chamber. It's been repaired. Degra isn't being realistic. This facility wasn't designed to manufacture such large quantities.
5532,ENT,episode 57,GRALIK,"There were impurities in the last three production cycles. 2 We'll have to increase the production rate by at least sixty percent. Assign two additional teams. 3 Your job is to synthesis kemocite. I suggest you get back to it. Have these canisters retested. Salvage what you can, then destroy the rest. Who are you? What do you want from me? Gralik Durr. Is that supposed to explain why you forced your way into my home? It's a multiphasic isotope. There are numerous applications. It depends on the level of refinement. That's none of your concern. Kemocite can be used for any number of purposes. I don't make a habit of asking our clients what they plan to do with it. What? I don't know what you're talking about. How long are you going to keep me here? Well, you can tell him that I'll be in my study. I have work to do. I've already told you everything I know. Ah, Captain Archer. I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me. That's correct. I don't know what this is. You burst into my home, show me some twisted piece of metal and tell me it proves I'm a mass murderer? I've never seen your species before. I've never heard of a planet called Earth, and whether you believe me or not, I had nothing to do with killing millions of its inhabitants. The kemocite is extremely refined. It did. We supply many species with kemocite, not just Xindi. It has countless applications. When Degra requested shipments so highly refined, we celebrated, realising the wealth it would bring to our colony. We never considered why he wanted such pure kemocite. Perhaps our greed blinded us from the possibility that it would be used in constructing a weapon. No, he's a Xindi Primate. They're similar to you. Ape-like. Degra and his people have always been fair, truthful. That may have been why I believed him when he said the shipment was for research. Perhaps he's become as untrustworthy as the reptilians. Five? I suppose there are, now. Do you mind? There was a sixth species, the avians. They've been gone since the war. Extinct. As far as I'm told, none of them fled before our homeworld was destroyed. The war went on for nearly a hundred years. The sides changed, alliances were forged and then broken. By the time it ended I doubt any of the six species remembered what started it, but everyone remembered what ended it. As well as being unstable politically, our planet was even more unstable geologically. In a final desperate act, the insectoids and reptilians detonated massive explosions beneath the eight largest seismic fissures. I'd like to think they didn't realise how devastating the result would be. My grandfather lived there. He told me of places where the sky was sometimes filled with avians. Now they're gone. The descendants of those that escaped are scattered across the Expanse. Many live peaceful lives, but obviously not all. They're ahead of schedule. We weren't expecting them for another three days. You might not have much time left to accomplish your mission. We've been processing kemocite for them for nearly six months. They're here for their final shipment. Captain, I'm the primary technician in this facility. They'll want to talk to me before accepting delivery, to confirm that all of their technical requirements have been met. I may be able to obtain some information for you about this weapon. I'm willing to take that risk. I'm proud of my craft, Captain. I've practiced it for many years. I won't let my work be corrupted in this way. Seven million people. If I'd chosen my clients more carefully, that tragedy might not have happened. I don't intend to let it happen again. Degra's probably wondering where I am. His companions don't like to be kept waiting. They'll return. Probably with armed reptilians. There are fewer than a hundred people on this planet. It doesn't go unnoticed when one of them is missing. Degra won't leave until he sees the results of the final isotopic analysis. You should reconsider my offer. It's a seeker. The reptilians built them for reconnaissance. They were used to great effect during the war. It seems as though you may have been exposed after all. There are some caves not far ahead. They should provide us with some cover in case we encounter any more of those. I doubt they'll find us. That's topaline ore. It should disrupt their scanners. Even their seekers won't locate us here. What do you intend to do now, Captain. Destroy our facility? Do you plan to wait until I'm back inside or will you simply dispose of me here in the forest? I'd certainly like to hear it. If you're prepared to trust me. It would be better if I went alone. And you. Have you started loading the shipment? 2 Good! I want to run another refinement test. We have to be absolutely certain that we've met their specifications. You know how important this is to all of us. You two perform the isotopic analysis, I'll run the sub-molecular scans. My personal activities aren't your concern. I was hunting tree scarabs. Your drone was frightening them. I prefer to spend my time in the forest alone. I was alone. You're two days early. Running some final tests. Forty two years. That's how long I've been running this facility, and never once have I allowed a single gram of kemocite to leave the premises unless it was perfectly calibrated. I take pride in my work, but if you're so eager to get underway then go ahead, take your shipment. But if it doesn't meet your requirements don't expect me to produce another hundred kilograms overnight, because we do have other clients besides you. Perhaps you'll need our services in the future. I'll miss the pleasure of your company. We've invested a great deal in this project. Yes, you've been more than generous, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me what this shipment is being used for. I don't think it's an unreasonable request. What kind of threat? I'm glad we could contribute. I may have just betrayed my people to a ruthless alien species. To trust. It should delay their progress considerably. Don't worry. I can deal with Degra and his friends. You should just be concerned with finding this weapon. The portal's range is only a few light years. Keep searching. If everything you've told me is true about the attack on your world, I hope you remember that all Xindi are not your enemy."

5535,ENT,episode 58,ARCHER,"Archer to the Bridge. Orders? From whom? What the hellâs going on? Hello? TâPol? Where are we? I was in the Command centre looking at long range scans. We were in a corridor. You and I, on our way to the Bridge. You coming tonight? I can make movie night mandatory for senior officers. Youâllenjoy it. Rosemaryâs Baby, itâll scare the hell out of you. Archer to the Bridge. Report. Take us out of warp. Iâm not leaving you. Like a shuttle pod landed on my head. Was anyone else hurt? Well, it'll have to wait. I want to get to the Bridge. This morning, staff briefing. Why? Whatâs going on, Phlox? Long term. You canât remove these parasites? I had an idea this morning, after you told me what happened. Icame up with a way to upgrade the antimatter inducers. We can travelfarther on less fuel. Let me guess. I already gave you these specs. I imagine that must happen often. Maybe these daily briefingsarenât such a good idea. Looks like itâs just a waste of your time, andTripâs. Iâm sure you have work to do. Iâll be in my quarters. Fortunately, I donât take orders from you. I suppose thereâs not much point in thanking me. A few hoursfrom now I wonât remember. Forrest made you Captain. I suppose congratulations are inorder, even if they are belated. I guess these parasites werenât soeasy to remove after all. What about the mission? Did you find the Xindi weapon? You said we eventually found the weapon. How could we manage thatwithout warp engines? Earth? How many of us are left? What happened to the crew? How did all these people get here? Come in. Did things go well with the Vulcans? There was obviously a reason I chose these quarters. You cansee a lot from this window. What did they want? Ha. Iâve been thinking about everything you told me. I realiseIâm not fit to command the ship, but thereâs got to be some way I canhelp. I could give Trip a hand in Engineering. So Iâm supposed to stay locked up in my quarters all day? In other words, just stay out of the way. The thought did cross my mind. How the hell did you know that? Exactly how far has it evolved? Is this why you came all the way from Denobula, to give me acheck-up? Captain Tucker. I donât think you need to call me sir anymore. How long has it been since you took command? Thank you, Commander is it? Did everyone get their own ship while I was gone? Hoshi. Why not remove all of them at once? Come in. It was a little disturbing. From my perspective, I saw most ofthose people just a few hours ago. It couldnât have been easy for you,telling me the same story over and over again for twelve years. I hope Iâve told you before, but, Iâm very grateful foreverything youâve done for me. If this works Go ahead TâPol, whatâs happening? To the Bridge. Iâm not going to just lie here while theydestroy whatâs left of humanity. TâPOL Turbolifts are down. The Bridge is gone. We donât have time to worry about parasites right now. Didnât you say that we could destroy the parasites with asubspace implosion? Can we create one? At this point, it wonât make much of a difference. You two getto a shuttlepod. Theyâre only after humans. If this doesnât work outyouâll still have a chance. Thatâs an order. One of the plasma injectors was damaged. We'll have to replaceit. Theyâre in supply locker C on the upper level. Weâre back in business. Phlox! Phlox? How much longer? Like a shuttlepod landed on my head. Whatâs our status? All right, Doctor. Fortunately, I donât take orders from you. Rosemaryâs Baby? Thanks. Would you mind bringing me another pillow? Would you turn down the lights just a little? You know, youâd make a wonderful nurse. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

After course. Twenty degrees to port. That last one took out warp engines. Weâve lost weapons. It is. Both ships are disabled. Weâve taken nine prisoners but the Brig was only designed fortwo. Iâm not sure what to do with the others. Weâre not going to get very far at that speed. Thereâs a ship approaching at high warp. Itâs Vulcan. You're looking well, sir. Actually, Iâve been promoted to Captain. Iâm picking up an intermittent duranium signature. Iâm not certain. Itâs in a close orbit around the sun. Thereâs a small vessel just outside the chromosphere. The hull configuration doesnât match. Thereâs one biosign onboard. His warp coils are charging. We searched your ship. We didnât find any cargo. We found your species in our Vulcan database. It appears Yridiansare information dealers. Phlox? The Xindi ships are in range. Our shields are holding. Nice to know they work in combat. The Insectoid ship's been damaged. Theyâre losing power. Their engine's disabled. Forward shieldingâs at fifty two percent. Our phase cannons are down.

5545,ENT,episode 58,SOVAL,"I need to speak with you, TâPol. That uniform doesnât suit you, Captain. I want you to return with me to Vulcan. Itâs not an order, itâs a request for your own safety. Two weeksago, the High Command received a distress call from the Earth convoy inthe Mutara system. By the time our ships reached them, they foundnothing but a field of debris. The weapon signatures were Xindi. Evenif your ships do manage to reach Ceti Alpha, itâs most likely youâllfind an armada waiting for you. It was a mistake ordering you to leave Enterprise. It forced youto make an impulsive decision. If you return with me now, the HighCommand is prepared to reinstate your rank. Them or him? There are specialists on Vulcan that can helpArcher. If you return to Vulcan. You owe the humans nothing. They choseto leave Earth before they were ready. If theyâd accepted our counsel,this tragedy would have been avoided. How? Your emotional attachment to Archer is clouding your logic. Weâll be within range for another thirty hours, should you reconsider."
5546,ENT,episode 58,T'POL,"Target their engines. Someone take him back to his quarters! Youâre up early. I know this all seems unfamiliar. I promise Iâll explaineverything. Why donât you sit down. Breakfast is almost ready. Jonathan, please, sit down. Iâll answer all of your questions. Today is a very important day. I have a great deal to tell you. Whatâsthe last thing you remember? Do you remember what happened after you left the Command centre? This will be difficult for you to accept, but that was twelveyears ago. I hadnât planned on it. You have to get out of here! The doctor continued to search for a remedy over the nextseveral weeks. Commander Tucker and I did our best to keep you updatedeach day on the progress of our mission. They were carrying a shipment with the same radiolyticsignature. I disagree. We both rely on your experience. You can stillcontribute to the success of this mission. In the corridor, when the anomaly hit, I urged you to leave mebehind. If you had, itâs likely Iâd be the one suffering from thiscondition. Captain, I never expressed my gratitude for what you did. Go ahead. Iâm on my way. This was not a conversation I was looking forward to. It was Admiral Forrest. The Command Council had reviewed the Doctorâsreport on your condition. They relieved you of duty and granted me afield commission. Phlox discovered that the organisms are from a domain outsidenormal space-time. They exist in a state of interspatial flux. None ofhis treatments had any effect on them. After several months of searching, we learned where the weaponwas being constructed, but the Xindi knew we were getting close. Theydispatched two vessels to intercept us. Send security teams. Have your men set up a defence perimeter on B deck. Is their ship still docked with us? The Xindi? Put them in crew quarterâs under heavy guard. How are therepairs coming? How long to repair them? Resume our previous heading. Dismissed. Thereâs no option. I chose the logical course of action. If you believe Iâve acted improperly, I suggest you contactAdmiral Forrest. We located the facility where the Xindi constructed the probe,but it had already been deployed. Destroyed. They didnât stop at your homeworld. They attackedevery human outpost they could find. Mars, Alpha Centauri, Vega colony,all were destroyed. Less than six thousand. Weâre on the fifth planet in the Ceti Alpha system. Itâs farfrom the Expanse. Most of them are still aboard the ship. Itâs in orbit,patrolling this system. Survivors from human colonies realised they needed a place totake refuge. Several convoys headed for this system. One of them was lead byEnterprise. Ambassador. Come in I doubt you travelled all this way to criticise my attire. I'm no longer under your authority. Weâre prepared to confront them. I wonât leave them. Youâd take him as well? We could have saved them. We held back their warp programme for one hundred years. Apolicy which you supported. If we would have helped them develop fasterships, better defences. How did you know that they were? They were here to replenish our supplies. We tried something similar to that a few months ago. It wasuncomfortable for you. You often take Porthos for a walk, visit the classrooms on Ddeck. The children enjoy hearing about our earlier missions. After nearly a year, we arrived in this system. Our conveywas the only one to reach it. The others had all been attacked anddestroyed. You're needed on Enterprise. The civilian leaders are going towant to meet with you. Iâm resigning my commission. Captain Archer will be better off on the surface with theothers. Heâll need a caretaker, someone he trusts. I canât be in twoplaces at the same time. I have my reasons. The civilian ships were disassembled for their components and rawmaterials. We used them to construct the settlement. At this point, youoften wonder if youâre a victim of some elaborate deception. Margaret Mullin. You met her when you were twenty four yearsold, during flight school in San Francisco. The night before yougraduated, you asked her to marry you, outside of her apartment onWestgate Avenue. She turned you down. She said she didnât want tobecome a Starfleet widow. Our relationship has evolved over the years. Weâre going to Enterprise. When can you begin? You left the reception early. I donât always tell it in detail. Iâm remaining at the settlement for the time being. He may needmy help during his recovery. Iâm not hiding anything. He risked his life to save me. Iâmmerely repaying a debt. Thereâs a discrepancy in these scans. Destroying these parasites is most likely the key to savinghumanity, and Earth. By destroying the organisms in the present, we appear to haveneutralised them in the past. History may be altered. Captain Archer will have remained incommand of Enterprise. Our mission in the Expanse could have anentirely different outcome. If the Xindi are on their way thereâs very little we can do tostop them.. Jonathan, you need to rest. Where are you going? TâPol to Phlox. Meet us in Engineering. Weâre going to finish the procedure. Thatâs not necessarily true. Come with me. I'll explain. Yes, but then we We would have to overload three plasma injectors. That wouldsend a feedback pulse through the reactor. With all due respect, you wererelieved of command. Stand by. Weâve cleared the anomalies. There is minor damage to thestarboard nacelle. Repairs should be complete within an hour. You could have been seriously injured. I told you to leave mebehind. I believe you wanted to see this. You were obviously looking forward to it, and since youâre notgoing to be able to attend tonight. Anything else?"
5547,ENT,episode 58,TUCKER,"It looked like we had a lead on that Xindi ship, the one we plantedthat tracking devise on, but it turned out to be a garbage scow. A week ago, but your upgrades are working nicely. Well, Ishould get back to Engineering. See you both later. Blow them out the airlock. We should have hull plating and torpedoes in the next couple ofhours. The warp drive's another question. The starboard nacelleâs alost cause, half the coils have been fused. If we were at Jupiter station, three weeks. Out here Iâd haveto rebuild the coil assembly from scratch. Six months minimum. For nowthe best I can give you is a warp one point seven. How can we keep going with one warp engine? What the world where you thinking when you rammed that ship? Since the Captain got sick, this missionâs taken one wrong turnafter another. This planet's barely Minshara-class. Maybe we shouldâve picked one witha little more blue and green on it. Iâd like to head down with a survey team and start scouting for colonysites. Me? Youâre the one they deal with. Youâre sure you want to do this? Youâre making one hell of a sacrifice. Why? Itâs good to see you sir. Old habits. I apologise for the low lighting. Weâre running onreserve power. Antimatterâs at a premium these days. Nine years. Iâve got some people whoâd like to say hello. Malcolmâs taking over the Intrepid from Ramirez. Thereâs a reception in the Mess hall if youâre feeling up to it. Is it a ship? Weâve better check it out. Lay in a course. Is it Xindi? Open up a channel. This is Captain Charles Tucker. Is theresomething we can help you with? Follow him. Target one of his nacelles. Bring it into the Launch bay. You picked an odd place for a business transaction. Who hired you? Was it the Xindi? Maybe we didnât give his vessel a close enough look. Go back tothe launch bay, use a plasma torch and slice that ship into neat littlepieces. Keep at it until you find some evidence that supports hisstory. Hired by who? What did you tell them? Answer me. Whatâs the problem? Those are my orders. Look, Iâd do anything to help the Captain,but weâve got bigger problems at the moment. Earthâs gone. Doc. Iâm sorry. We need all the power weâve got for the weapons. Well, we canât just run up the white flag. Iâm on my way. We'll talk about this later. Charge the phase cannons. Is everyone in position? Fire! Remind me to send a note to General Shran. Adjust your heading. Three one oh mark two seven. Full impulse. What about the others? Target the second one. I think weâre going to find out how much of a beating these newshields can take. Tell them to withdraw. Hard to port!"

5555,ENT,episode 58,PHLOX,"How do you feel? No. Captain, there are a few questions I have to ask you. Iâm afraid I have to insist. When did you last speak toCommander Tucker? The anomaly in the corridor left something behind. Weâve neverseen it before. This is a microcellular scan of your hippocampus. Youâve been infected by several clusters of parasites. They havenâtcaused any tissue damage but theyâre impairing certain synapticfunctions. Theyâre preventing you from forming new long term memories. You can recall events that happened before the infection, buteverything after fades within a few hours. Captain, youâve been inSickbay for the past three days. You last spoke to Commander Tuckerabout seven hours ago. He came to see you, right here. So far, they havenât responded to any traditional therapies, butIâm synthesising an antigen that shows some promise. You can be assuredI wonât stop working on this until I find a cure. Weâve lost thirteen of the crew, twenty two injured, several critical. Nothing seems to have changedsince your last exam. You didnât tell him? After this settlement was established, itbecame clear that I was never going to find a treatment for yourcondition if I remained here, so I returned home and consulted withsome of the finest neurosurgeons and quantum theorists on Denobula. Mycolleagues believed there was no way to destroy these parasites shortof vaporising you in a subspace implosion. They assured me thetechnology to do what was required did not exist, and they werecorrect. It took almost a decade to develop, but now Iâm ready to putit to the test. The procedure requires tremendous amounts of energy,levels that can only be produced in the reactor of a warp poweredstarship. A visit to Engineering may be in order first. Iâll be using a highly focused antiproton beam to eradicate theparasites. Weâll start with this cluster today. This procedureâs never been attempted before. We should movecautiously. The emitters should be calibrated within the hour. Phlox to Captain Archer. Weâre ready. Increase to eight hundred millicochranes. Increase to eight fifty. Just as my simulations predicted. Thereâs no trace of the parasites Itargeted. Well, I understand I may have a passenger on my voyage home. Have you told the Captain how you feel about him? Itâs obvious youâve become quite attached. Itâs nothing to be ashamedof. Vulcanâs experience the same emotions as any other species. Theyâresimply better at hiding them. I can only imagine what it must have been like. Spending allthose years in that house, learning so much about him, yet he remembersnothing about you beyond the day he became ill. If weâre successful,perhaps things will be different. What is it? Your engineers wonât let us continue with the Captainâstreatment. This maybe the only solution to your problems, Captain. This image was taken a few minutes ago. You can see the regionwhere I eradicated the first cluster of parasites. Itâs gone in thisimage, as well. This scan was taken over twelve years ago. The cluster hasdisappeared from all the scans Iâve taken over the last twelve years. It's as if it never existed at all We know theyâre from another spatial domain. Apparently, theyalso exist outside of time. If we can eliminate all of the parasites,itâs possible the Captainâs infection will never have occurred. We only have to divert power for a few hours. I am certain I cancomplete the procedure in that time. Go ahead. Understood. Iâm sorry, Captain. The chamberâs been damaged. You'll destroy the ship? How do you feel? You suffered a mild concussion. Iâd like to keep you overnightfor observation."

There's no telling how anyone would react ifthey find out who we really are. Keep a low profile. Afternoon. I'm passing through town. I was hoping I could sit in here fora while till it cools down. Thanks. My brother's got a ranch down south. He said he could set me upwith some work. How'd you know? Yeah. Yeah, I do. You're not telling me you're related toCooper Smith? I'll be damned. I'll bet you've got some stories. Friends of yours? Excuse me. Can I get some more coffee before you shoot him? Name's Archer. I don't like being interrupted in themiddle of a conversation. I'll keep that in mind. Just passing through town. I just wanted him to get me a cup of coffee. Maybe you're right. It's been a pleasure. Didn't mean to startle you. My name's Jonathan Archer. I saw you this morning, paying forthat man's casket. Can I help you with that? It's no trouble. I'd like to learn more about the Skagarans. There aren't any where I come from. Up north, quite a ways. I don't think that Skagaran's life is any less valuable thanmine. Well, you are the teacher around here, aren't you? The firstSkagaran I ever saw was today, lying in that coffin. Seems I'd be morelikely to get the truth from you than from the men who put him there. Bethany, these are the friends I told you about. Thanks. A ship? Go back to Enterprise, see what you can salvage. Don't want to miss my first day at school. I thought you could bend the local ordnances. Thanks. What's going to happen to you know. You didn't get to finish your lesson. I'd like to hear the restof it. Everyone seems to have their own version. I'm curious to hearthe way you teach it to the Skagarans. That wreck at their settlement,was that their ship? You mean slaves. Tell me about Cooper Smith. So they could never enslave the humans again. No thanks. I feel civilised enough. That's the plan. That a crime? But if I decided to lynch a Skagaran, that'd be legal? Protect us from what? Children? You're judging them on something that happened over two hundredyears ago. What's going to happen to Bethany? Archer to Enterprise. There's something I have to do first. I was on my way out of town and realised I forgot something. It's called a jail break where I come from. There are othersettlements. I'm sure they could use a good teacher. Maybe not, but you won't be spending ten years in prison. Archer to Enterprise. Lock the transporter onto my position. There are two of us. I didn't exactly have time to find a secluded spot. Will she make it? What do you mean? They kidnapped the wrong people. Once we've dealt with the Xindi we'll come back here. Do whatwe can to help them. For now, they deserve to know that Earth hasn'tabandoned them. We need to talk. I was born in up-state New York. Spent most of my adult life inSan Francisco, though. You've heard of San Francisco? I wasn't sure how you'd react. We thought we'd better get thelay of the land first. We can't, not right now. Anyway, our ship isn't big enough. Someday we'll come back for you. You, you realise it's not the sameworld your ancestor's left. A lot's changed in three hundred years. We've moved past things like intolerance, prejudice. That was a long time ago. I understand, but if you do make it back to Earth you're goingto have to leave all that behind. This is my First Officer, T'Pol. She's from a planet calledVulcan. Good. I thought we'd bring Mister MacCready Let's talk this through, Bennings. Trust me, you don't want to pick a fight with us, Deputy. We're not taking sides here. I can prove it to you. Just give me a chance. Lay down some fire. We're up too high to see it but your town is down there,towards the right edge of that mountain range. How are you feeling? Doctor Phlox does excellent work. The progress on Earth, it didn't happen overnight. It may be a while before we're able to start sending shipshere. My guess is, by the time they arrive they'll find things havechanged. It's happening already. I spoke with MacCready.

And the same people who lynched him would have been sitting onthe jury. What do you want? I don't know where you're from, Mister Archer, but around hereno one refers to a Skagaran as a man. If you'll excuse me. I'll manage. I'll ask you again. What do you want? Everyone knows about the Skagarans. Where's that? If certain people had their ways there wouldn't be any aroundhere either. I heard about what you did in the saloon today. DeputyBennings has a nasty temper. Why would your risk getting thrown injail, maybe worse? So, what do you want with me? Would you like to meet more of them? It's all right. You're from up north too? The children will be here soon. You said you wanted to learnsomething, Mister Archer. You're welcome to stay for the lesson. It's illegal to teach Skagarans. Nine times twelve, don't forget to carry the one. Yral? That's right. You're doing very well with your multiplicationtables. Tomorrow night we'll start with something a little morechallenging. Long division. Kret, collect the slates, please. I'vebrought a friend with me who'd like to learn more about your people. Who can tell Mister Archer how the humans and the Skagarans came tolive together? Taliyah? And why did they do that? But the humans didn't want to work for the Skagarans, didthey. Go on home now. Go on, it's all right. Nobody's being hurt here. Get away from me. Best I can do. Don't worry. This isn't the first time the Sheriff and Ihaven't seen eye to eye. You know the story. Everyone does. They used it three hundred years ago to go to Earth and bringour ancestors back here. They were building colonies, they neededworkers. It was a terrible crime. That's where the stories differ somewhat. To the humans he's afolk hero, our liberator. I'm sure that's what you were taught. But theSkagarans, they call him rakh'tar. It means butcher. He and his menburned the Skagaran ship, destroyed their weapons. They murdered mostof them. Entire families. Have you heard that version? Smith wrote thefirst laws that kept the Skagarans from going to school, owningproperty, even marrying. That's how they justified it. Men like Bennings are happy tocarry on the tradition. What are you doing? It's called that here, too. Where do you expect me to go? Things won't be any different there. I feel fine. Not even a scar. You must think we're barbaric. All the things humanity'saccomplished, building ships like this, travelling to other world, andwe're still down there shooting each other. But it was progress all the same. You've managed to change, wehaven't. Even if you could take us back, I don't think we're ready. I think you're giving us too much credit. Before people could travel through space to other planets,they had to get off the ground first. Almost forty years after my humanancestors left Earth, two brothers from Ohio became the first humanbeings to build a successful flying machine. Their names were Orvilleand Wilbur Wright. Would anyone like to see a picture of theirairplane? You all would. Well, here it is, right here, and you can seehere's Orville Wright, and his brother Wilbur is flying the plane.

6061,ENT,episode 59,STABLEHAND,"Can I help you folks? What happened to yours? It's a long way from the next town. How'd you get here? Well, you're lucky the sun vipers didn't get you, or thoseSkags. Come on. This one here, fouryears old, good stock. Twenty dollars, she's yours. Well, that depends what you've got to trade. Haven't seen one of these in years. You got yourself a deal, buddy."

6065,ENT,episode 59,STABLEHANDL,"Look, I know it's not worth the horse, but we only need him fora couple of hours. We just want to ride out and grab our gear. We'll beback before you know it. Well, how about I leave my gun for collateral."
6066,ENT,episode 59,MACCREADY,"Who's paying for the box? I hope you're not planning to bury him in the cemetery. I'm sorry I didn't get there in time to stop them. He'd have gotten a trial. Bethany, he killed a man. Self-defence or not, that's ahanging offence for a Skag. Is there a problem here? I saw you this morning at the undertakers. What's yourbusiness here? This Skag a friend of yours? It's a little hot for coffee, don't you think? Keep an eye on him. Make sure he leaves town. And Bennings,leave the Skag alone. Care for a shave, Mister Archer? You sure? There ain't nothing like a barber shave to make aman feel civilised. Suit yourself. Thanks Henry. Have a seat. Skagaran whisky. It's illegal, but I've letHenry keep a bottle around for pulling teeth. Packs ahell of a wallop. I thought you were heading south to raisebluehorns. Then maybe you can tell me why you were out in Skagtown inthe middle of the night. My deputy says you and Miss Bethany were teaching thosechildren. That's a crime. The law was laid down a long time ago to protect men likeyou and me. You really want those children to learn how to read, how todo their numbers, and then maybe they can learn about how they used tobe in charge around here. How they had guns that could kill a man witha beam of light, and the human beings were nothing but their labourforce, their property. Is that what you want those children to learn,Mister Archer? And it's my job to make sure it never happens again. Now,I'm not saying it's fair. It's just the way it's always been. I expectyou to be out of town in an hour. She's been warned. She knew the consequences. Minimumsentence is ten years. They couldn't have gotten far. Get Nash and Franklin. Maybe you ought to get your eyes checked, Bennings. Archer'sa human. You don't know that. 'Cause you were being a horse's ass. You have something in mind? Now you listen to me. I'm not going to murder those peoplejust because some stranger spooked you with a parlour trick. Now if Iget some proof that the Skagarans are up to something, I'll take careof it. And you've always harassed them while I've looked the otherway, and that's going to change right now. As long as you work for me,our job is to enforce the law. Understood? And you were born there? Pacific coast. Why didn't you tell us who you were? Well, I can't say I blame you. A part of me never believedEarth even existed. I thought it was something people made up becausethey couldn't stand living here. You taking us back? You're telling me. The Skagarans abducted my ancestors, Captain. Turned theminto slaves. Well, we tend to have a long memory when it comes to thatsort of thing. We did what we had to do. It's all right. These folks aren't going to hurt anybody. Ma'am. These people are from Earth, Bennings."
6067,ENT,episode 59,BENNINGS,"Any last words? I didn't know Skags believed in hell. How about a little service? Anything but that rot-gut you were pouring yesterday. Why don't you join us? It's Deputy Bennings, and I can bend a local ordnance if Ichoose. Have a seat. I imagine you could use a drink, afterwhat happened last night. Let's raise a glass to the dearly departed. To dead Skags. Drink up. I thought you people could hold your liquor. Your friendhad a few in him the night he killed Clay Stanton. Beg your pardon? Oh, no, wait a minute. I don't think I heard you right. You're telling me that a sober Skag had the nerve to shoot a man? Ifind that hard to believe. Maybe you could demonstrate. Pick it up, shoot meright here between the eyes. This is your golden opportunity, don'tpass it up. I know you'd like to killme. That's what all you Skags want, isn't it? Go ahead, or maybe youneed to finish that drink first. Who the hell are you? Well, Mister Archer, you could learn a thing or two aboutmanners. I was just having a drink with our friend Draysik and thisgentleman decided to butt in. No, we didn't. I tried to warn you, Bethany. Teaching Skags is a crime. Youknow that. So you say, but I'm afraid the law is the law. That's true, but this is one I have no intention of bending. Sheriff gave you a chance to leave town. You should havetaken it. Sheriff wants to talk to you. It was Archer. Drop that, whatever it is. You heard the story same as me. Cooper Smith said the Skagscould move through thin air from one place to another. He's working with them. What was he doing out in Skagtown? Why'd he stick up forDraysik in the saloon yesterday? And who was he talking to on that little box he had? It wasthe Skags. They helped him escape. This is what we were afraid of, Mac. They'd try to take over again. It's time to put an end to this. I say we ride out there tonight and burn 'em out. I guaranteethere'll be plenty of volunteers. You've always been too soft on them, Mac. Understood. Have your men drop those guns. I never was one for talking. Should have thought of that when you threw in with the Skags. Then where'd you get that machine and those weapons? Earth? You're lying."

6072,ENT,episode 60,ARCHER,"The most difficult task facing any Captain, any crew, is theloss of a shipmate. We've come here to honour one of our own. In thetime we knew him, he showed us just how much one life can truly matter. We will never forget what he did for us, and for the ship he loved somuch. We will go forward with renewed determination to complete thismission, so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people onthis ship, but for all the citizens of Earth. TwoWeeks Earlier Archer. You heard the man, Travis. Four point nine. We just got our second wind. Drop to impulse. Trip, status. Analysis. Is that what stopped us? Keep scanning. Polarise the hull plating. Then purge the intake manifolds and shut all the exhaust ports. Go ahead. On my way. Run a full sensor scan. I want to know what we'redealing with. Report. How much time before we can get the engines back online? You'll be supervising the repairs. I've just come from Sickbay. Trip's in a coma. He has extensive neural damage. Doctor Phlox says wehave to prepare for the possibility that Trip won't survive. How is he? How does this relate to Trip? It becomes a clone. And you want to do this with Trip. Use his to grow asimbiot. It's fifteen day life span. Come in. But the longer we remain in the field, the more these particlesbuild up. Do whatever you have to do, but we need to get those enginesback online. I approved it. We don't answer to the Lyssarrian Prime Conclave. I'm aware of the ethical implications. If we weren't in theExpanse maybe my decision would be different, but we've got to completethis mission. Earth needs Enterprise, Enterprise needs Trip. It's assimple as that. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The engines are still down and thenucleonic particles continue to build up on the hull. It's been twodays since Doctor Phlox initiated the procedure to grow the simbiot. Three days ago he was just another one of your creatures,something you kept on a shelf. Sounds like you've found yourself a new roommate. I'm sure you'll think of something. So the older he grows, the more of Trip's life he'll recall? He's starting to look like Trip. It's only been three days and he's already beginning to realisehow different he is. I gave the order that created him. I should be the one toexplain why. Whoa! Where do you think you're off to? Now, don't take it personally. Fetching isn't his style.  It's almost time for his dinner. Do you want to helpme feed him? Come on. There's nothing Porthos likes more than dinnertime. I haven't taught him any. Mostly what he does is eat, sleep,and not fetch. Just fill it up half way. Is that right. That's right, he did. That's a picture of him right there, and this is me on my firstday of flight school. As long as I can remember. It's what I was meant to do. It has its moments. Let me show you something. Keep the nose up. That's right. Trim the port aileron. What? That's a little difficult to answer. Nothing a little glue won't remedy. I crashed it plenty oftimes myself. Come with me. It's okay. That's right. Yes. No. You're more than that, Sim. You have Trip's memories, but youalso have your own memories, the ones you're making here on Enterprise. You were born only four days ago. It's hard to understand, I know. There's part of you, somethinginside you, that Trip needs. Doctor Phlox is going to have to performan operation. When Phlox says it, it's the truth. Sure. Captain's log, supplemental. Enterprise has been incapacitated forseven days. During that time Sim has practically become a member of thecrew. I've assigned him to Engineering where he's been assisting T'Polin the on-going effort to repair the engines. Archer to T'Pol. Would you please come to my Ready room. I'm afraid that won't be soon enough. Come in. That's out of the question. This is a dangerous procedure. You've never flown a shuttlepodbefore. I can't jeopardise this ship on the strength of those memories. Mayweather and Reed will pilot the shuttlepods. I want you toco-ordinate from the Bridge. T'Pol will assist you. Yeah, that's part of it. My main concern is that this plan work. If we don't make it outof here in the next six hours it won't matter if Trip survives or not. We'll all be dead. Try the doors. Archer to shuttlepods one and two. ARCHER{OC} Whenever you're ready. Come on. Come on. Go ahead. Sim. Sorry, Sim. Archer to the shuttlepods. How much do we need? That's good enough. Archer to shuttlepods one and two. Come onhome. Well done. You wanted to see me? I'm listening. You told me you could remove the tissue without harming him. That isn't how we see it. Is there any truth to it? Doctor? How long have you been staying here? These are Trip's quarters. Commander Tucker is lying in Sickbay. If you refuse to go through with this you'll be condemning Tripto death. No, but you can save him. Phlox says there's almost no chance that the enzyme will work. But at what cost? It'll take a day to synthesise the enzyme. Bythat time your neural tissue won't be compatible with Trip's anymore. He'll die. I can't let that happen. If you truly have all of Trip's memories, you know the answerto that. I don't have to tell you what's at stake. I must complete thismission, and to do that I need Trip. Trip! I'll take whatever step'snecessary to save him. Even if it means killing you. Don't make me one. What's the problem? Archer to the Launch Bay. Come in. What stopped you? What would that be? I can't argue with you there. What? I believe that. That's why I gave the order to create you. Thanks. We will never forget what he did for us, and for the ship he loved somuch. We will go forward with renewed determination to complete thismission, so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people onthis ship, but for all the citizens of Earth. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

Do these memories just come to you? I can't imagine it. You wanted to ask me about something. I suppose so. Why? Is someone planning on going somewhere? Right. The shuttlepods don't generate that kind of thrust. We'd neverbuild up enough momentum to get clear of the field in time. Acknowledged. Acknowledged. One thousand kilodynes. Two thousand kilodynes. Engine temperature's rising. Two thousand five hundred kilodynes. Engine temperature's nearing critical. Captain? Increasing thirty percent. I'm reading five hundred degrees above critical.

6083,ENT,episode 60,T'POL,"That will stabilise the warp field? If we can maintain high warp for extended periods, we can coverthe Expanse more quickly. To the left. Lie on your back. Advanced neuro-pressure can place great demands on the body. We haven't gotten to the more challenging postures. Breathe. The warp field is fluctuating. Field fluctuations have dropped to zero. Something's flooding the intake manifolds. The flare is causing a system-wide overload. Some kind of polaric field, approximately eleven thousandkilometres in diameter. Composition unknown. I'll need more time tocomplete a detailed scan. It's a logical conclusion. When we entered the field nucleonic particles flooded themanifolds, causing the injector flare. If Commander Tucker hadn't shutdown the reactor, we could have had a breach. We're still running diagnostics. The damage is significant. Itcould take weeks. Commander Tucker's going to have his hands full. We sent out an EV team. They retrieved a sample of the substanceaccumulating on the hull. Multiple hits with a plasma rifle wererequired to dislodge it. It's composed of highly charged particles,mostly ferric ions, but there are several elements that we can'tidentify. And it'shighly magnetic. So far, the danger to the ship seems negligible. Understood. Regarding the Lyssarrian procedure Doctor Phloxproposed, may I ask if you've reached a decision? Are you aware that the Lyssarrian Prime Conclave has banned thecreation of simbiots? Simbiots are living, conscious entities. We'll be growing asentient being for the sole purpose of harvesting tissue. He certainly sounds healthy. In a short time he'll be a lot older. Have you thought of wherehe's going to live? This looks promising. I'll be reviewing the field coil equations. They need to befinished in time for tomorrow's reactor test. I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I have to work late intothe evening. Ensign Massaro is running a diagnostic on the plasmaassembly. I'd like you to assist her. I simply believe that our attention should be focused on theship's engines, at least until the current situation is resolved. Go ahead. On my way. Warp drive should be functional in two weeks. Sir, I reviewed them thoroughly. A fusion overburn has never been attempted with a shuttlepodengine. I agree. Despite the risks, I believe it's our best option. I already have. Was there something else? I was instructing him in the practice of Vulcan neuro-pressure. How Commander Tucker was hoping to modify them. They were helping him sleep. What do you mean? If you're referring to a romantic relationship, no. I can't answer that. I'm not uncomfortable. Phase cannons are charged and ready. They're still frozen. I'm reading zero forward momentum. We're still not moving. Their systems are overloading. They won't last a few seconds. We're moving. Point six two kilometres per hour. At this speed we'll emerge from the field in six point onehours. Your shift ended ninety minutes ago. You've been working for eighteen straight hours. I haven't commended you on the successful implementation of yourplan. You saved the ship. Lyssarrian Desert Larva. Your point? You wish to spend your last hours in Engineering? If you'd like, the A3 injector port needs replacing. May I come in? I just wanted to say how much your absence willaffect the crew. How much it will affect me."
6084,ENT,episode 60,TUCKER,"We just reroute the system taps, compress the antimatter streambefore it reaches the injectors. Every simulation I run comes back with the same result. We'llbe able to cruise at warp five point oh with no field fluctuation. I'mtalking about a ride so smooth you could build a house of cards on thewarp reactor. Which boosts our chances of finding the Xindi weapon in time. Oh, sorry. You get me talking about the engines and I forgetwhere I am. Don't know what it is about fine-tuning a piece ofmachinery. You know, you made this sound a whole lot worse than it is. Well, I have to say that so far, it's a piece of cake. Well, I'm always up for a challenge. Tucker to the Bridge. We're all set down here. I'll need at least four point nine To get the plasma hot enough to compress the stream. Initialising stream compression. Damn, that's a beautiful sound. I've got a primary injector flare. I'm shutting down. It's not responding, Captain."

6092,ENT,episode 60,PHLOX,"Phlox to Captain Archer. Would you come down to Sickbay? His condition's unchanged. I'd like to show you something. Thisis one of the more interesting members of my little menagerie, aLyssarrian Desert Larvae. It's epidermal layers secrete a viralsuppressant that I use as a salve for cuts and bruises. The larvae have another, somewhat more controversial, property. When implanted with the from another species it exactly replicatesthat species' life-cycle, albeit at a rapidly accelerated rate. Essentially, but one that is born, grows old and dies inapproximately fifteen days. The Lyssarrians call them mimetic simbiots. They're a closely guarded secret. Very few people know of theirexistence. To harvest it's neural tissue for transplant. There's noguarantee that human will stimulate the larvae's growth cycle, butas it stands now it may be Commander Tucker's only hope for survival. To ensure the tissue's compatibility, I'll have to wait until thesimbiot reaches Commander Tucker's present physical age, then I canexcise the tissue from a non-critical region of the simbiot's cerebralregion. It would experience no discernable side effects and should beable to live out it's normal life span. I don't make this proposal lightly, Captain, but I'm obligatedto provide you with all available options. It's rather sensitive to light at this stage. By tomorrowmorning, if all goes well, we'll have a healthy baby boy on our hands. Perfect genetic duplicate, right down to the birthmark on hisright side. And hungry. Excuse me. There, there. Oh, it's been some time since I've had anew-born, but I see I haven't lost my touch. He's certainly come a long way in a short time. Why not right here? I can't think of a more stimulatingenvironment for a developing young mind, and I'd be able to keep aclose watch on his development. Now all I need to do is find him a name. The crew's beenoffering suggestions but nothing sounds right. Steven, Enrique, Dennis. Dennis? You see my dilemma? Chief Medical Officer's log. After much deliberation I havefinally thought of a name for this newest addition to our crew. It's all right, Sim. It's all right. Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imaginethe strange horror of it's a - app - appearance. It's become quite evident that Sim's remarkable scholasticprogress goes far beyond an aptitude for learning. He's remembering things that happened to Trip when Trip was thisage. There are some species that rely solely on genetic sequencing topass on their cultural memories. Evidently, humans have a similarcapacity. This could be an important discovery. He certainly possessesCommander Tucker's curiosity. This morning he took apart my medicaltricorder. And he's beginning to ask questions. Where did I come from? Where's my mother and father? Why am I here? He's going to have to be told the truth, soon. I'm sorry, Captain. I was in the middleof giving Porthos his physical. I only turned my back for a moment. Yes, indeed. He's in peak physical condition. Which is more thanI can say for myself. Not at all. You won't feel a thing. There's been a development. Sim won't survive the transplant. That assessment was based on simbiots grown from Lyssarrian DNA. My tests on Sim show that human based simbiots are not as resilient. IfI excise the quantity of neural tissue I need to save Commander Tucker,Sim will die. I'm sorry, Captain. They were a group of Lyssarrian scientists who conducted illegalexperiments on simbiots. They claimed to have developed an enzyme thatstopped the rapid aging process. The enzyme is experimental, with very little empirical evidenceto suggest that it works. That's why I didn't mention it. We're ready for you. No need to apologise. You were a damn good son."

My mumthinks I should study architecture, but I want to do what you do, be astarship captain. You know what's weird? My parents call me Trip, but everyone here calls me Sim. Where'smy mum and dad? Are they back on Earth? It's broken. I miss my parents. Doctor Phlox says I'm not allowed to go in there. He's Trip. My parents. They're not really mine, they're his. So, that time I put a garden snake in Lizzie's dollhouse, thatwasn't me. So I'm just some kind of copy of him. How long have I lived here? I feel older. Will it hurt? Doctor's always say that. Can we go fix the model now? Wave guides for the primary port bypass. Think I'vemade some progress. They're showing 'A Night At The Opera' tonight. Marx Brothers. Wondered if you're planning to go. Oh. What about dinner? Want to grab a bite? Yes, ma'am. It's because I'm different, isn't it? The reason youdon't want to do anything with me. I guess it must be weird, being withsomeone like me. Five days ago I was wearing diapers. I probably won't be around after the current situation's resolved. I suddenly realised it was my favourite dessert. Now I know why. The older I get, the more I remember. It's like I've lived thiswhole other life. Can't explain it. Yeah, I did. Do you think it's possible to redirect the phasecannons so they can fire back onto the hull? I want to try and blast off enough of that particulate so we canopen up the Launch Bay doors. All we need to do is build up enough momentum to can get the shipout of here, right? Well, we've got two perfectly good engines sitting in the LaunchBay. If we string a couple of grappler lines between the shuttlepodsand the ship we can tow ourselves clear. Leave that to me. Can I come in? Did you have a chance to look at my calculations? And? That doesn't mean it won't work. So you're going to recommend the plan to the Captain? You and Trip used to spend a lot of time here together. I remember. We were lying right there, working the neural nodes oneach other's feet, talking about the warp engines. How I was hoping tomodify them. Right. Commander Tucker. You know, he was really starting to enjoythose sessions with you. I'm not sure that's the only reason. Was there ever anything between you and Trip? The reason I ask is, well, you're all I think about, if you knowwhat I mean. And I'm not talking about an adolescent crush. That was,well, that was two days ago. This is much more serious, the way I feelabout you. Anyway, what's driving me crazy is, I don't know if thesefeelings are mine or his. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. I just thought I should tell you this, while I still had thechance. I want to pilot one of the shuttlepods. It's my plan. I think I should have a say in how it's implemented. Yes, I have. Trip has thousands of hours of flying time and I havehis memories. You're worried something'll happen to me, aren't you. You want tomake sure I'm around because you need part of my brain. So your concern for my safety is really about saving Trip. I've realigned the targeting scanners. They're setfor close proximity. Set the overrun ratio. We'll start at oh point one seven five. Prepare to initiate on my mark. Now. Increase the overburn ratio another Thirty percent. A few more seconds. Thanks Captain. Just want to get these initiators in place. If you had five days left, would you spend them sleeping? Besides,tomorrow morning I'm walking into Sickbay to donate some of my unneededneural tissue. Which means that pretty soon I'll be answering to thereal Trip, and if I know him, he's going to want these engines in asgood a shape as they can be. I appreciate that. I wanted to learn something about my own species, so I've beendoing a little research. Mostly on lifespans. Did you know that at onetime in history human beings lived an average of only thirty fiveyears? The average Vulcan lifespan was only forty? Just that both species expend a lot of effort to change thosestatistics. I guess it's just natural for people to want to stickaround for as long as possible. Why not give up my life? I've only got five, six days left anyway. Let me ask you something, Doc. When you researched Lyssarrianlarvae did you come across any references to the Velandran Circe? Why do you think he kept it a secret? There's not much evidence, but it exists. The fact is, I may nothave to grow old and die in a week. There's a chance that I can liveout a normal lifespan. I can't change what happened to him but maybe Ican change what's going to happen to me. Come in. I was on the way to my room last night, but I came here instead. Which is where I belong. I have his memories, I have his feelings,I have his body. How am I not Trip? Then what am I? Just something you grew in a lab? Does that makeit easier for you to condemn me to death? I didn't put him in a coma. In a way I will, by saving myself. My life is at stake! Any chance is worth taking. I know. So what are you going to do? Drag me down to Sickbay, force meonto a biobed at gunpoint? Even if it means killing me. You're not a murderer. Iwas wondering if there's anything I can still do. Maybe there's a panelI can install or something. I've got a few hours to kill before myoperation. Why not? The two things I care most about are in this room. I'll get right on it. I was all ready to do it. Where the hell was I going to go? We're nowhere near any habitableplanet. Didn't really want to spend the rest of my life floating aroundin a shuttlepod which doesn't even have any toilet facilities. Can youimagine a lousier way to spend your old age? Cooped up in that thing,peeing in a bottle? Actually, I can imagine a worse fate. Being stuck in there with Malcolm. Damn, this is a screwed upsituation. A lifetime in eight days. It's not that I'm scared of dying, it'sjust that I can't imagine not being here tomorrow. You want to knowwhat really stopped me? My sister. And she was my sister as much as Trip's. I don't want what happened to her to happen to anyone else. Do me a favour when this is over. If Commander Tucker decides todo any more modifications to the engines, tell him to watch his ass. Yes. On my way. I appreciate that. All in all, I guess I've had a pretty goodlife. I couldn't have asked for a better going awaypresent. I'm sorry I doubted you, Doc. I'm serious. You see, I don't just remember Trip's childhood, Iremember mine. You made a damn good father. You said to me once that commanding a starship was what you meantto do. I guess this is what I was meant to do. Good luck, Captain. You owe me one."

6350,ENT,episode 61,ARCHER,"Good boy. Cheese? This isyour last piece. About time you showed up. Our mission's changed quite a bitsince the last time I saw you, but I suppose you're aware of it. Maybe you could fill in a few of the blanks for me. The Xindiweapon would be a good place to start. I thought you and your colleagues were supposed to be keepingan eye on the time line. You're from the thirtieth century. Hasn't allthis happened already? How could that be? But they are happening. The time traveller, the man the Suliban worked for. He's the one who told us about the weapon being built. Should Ibelieve him? You said I'm supposed to play some crucial part in history. Does this have something to do with it? You're not being very helpful. Why are you here? This Expanse is filled with Xindi. Sorry to get you up, but this couldn't wait. I just had a visit from Daniels. I think all your doubts abouttime travel are about to go out the window. Daniels and his team have discovered three Reptilians on Earthin the early twenty first century. He wants to send us back to find outwhat they're doing. He told me I could bring one person, no more. It took him a long while to get permission to interact with me. There are clearances. He said it would take too much time. He said the three Xindi travelled to Earth from our century. They've been there for two months. They're not sight-seeing, T'Pol. Wehave to find out what they're up to. He wants us to meet him in the Command Centre at oh eighthundred tomorrow. Come on, boy. Check the database. Findsomething to wear that won't stand out in 2004. He gave me this, said he'd return us whenever we signalled him. These are temporal tags. We canuse them to bring back anything that doesn't belong there. I'm sure you'll think of something. Try to stay out of trouble. Here's the duty roster. And a hundred and fifty years into the past. You will be. Come on. This one has a motion activated security system. Thisone too. We're in. Foot controls. What year is that map from? The layout shouldn't have changed a lot in two years. If that thing has a scanning radius of three kilometres, howfar are we going to have to drive to cover the entire city? It's a gasoline pump. We need to get fuel. Where isn't the problem. We're going to need money. UScurrency. Not necessarily. People used to go to jail for this. They had been for thirty years, but it wasn't until 2061 thatthey finally Any humans? This doesn't look very residential. Set your phase pistol tokill. When the Reptilians boarded Enterprise, stun had no effect. Seewhat you can find out. I'll look over there. There's a neutronic power source coming from thefirst floor. I see it. Here he comes. And the man in the wheelchair. Why were you bringing him to anabandoned factory in the middle of the night? Why would you take it? You make it a habit of climbing out your window when someoneknocks on the door? Tell us about your friends on Carpenter Street. You were there an hour ago with the man in the wheelchair. Nowtell me who's inside that factory. Untie him. I didn't feel right doing that with you tied up. CarpenterStreet. Untie him again. How many? How did this doctor find you. What's he paying you? What does he look like? You are going to do it again. That is, if you have any hope ofstaying out of prison. These two files, AB positive and B negative, they're the finaltwo? Well, then you're looking at your next victim, a healthy malewith B negative blood. What side of the street is it on? One Double Superbeef without lettuce, please. A double will be fine. A hamburger, ketchup only. No, thank you. No, no combo. You're sure? Do the best you can. They brought a bio-reactor with them. They're synthesisingsome kind of viral agent. Rajiin warned us about a bio-weapon. This could be it. Daniels said they might be hiding from someone. The past seems like a pretty good place to hide. We've got to keep them from getting it back to our time. I don't know. I was thinking about trying to take out the bio-reactor,but I could end up spreading whatever's in there across half the city. I've got to find it first. They've gone out the west door. They couldbe headed for the street. They have the virus. T'Pol. They're in the west alley way north of the main Building. I could use some help. Come on. He's trying to release the toxin. If he's trying to destroy humanity, he's not going to be ableto do it with that. They only modified the virus for six blood types. Let's hope he can't see in the dark. Keep laying down fire. Don't move a muscle. Drop it. Why a second weapon? Where wereyou going to take it? Let's go. It's done. Archer to Lieutenant Reed. Get a team down to the Command centre on the double. Wait here for Malcolm. Have everything brought toCargo Bay two. I've got to get this to Phlox."

How are we supposed to accomplish this? We just travelled ninety light years back to Earth. Forgive me if I'm not entirely convinced. This apparatus. It appears to have been designed to incapacitatethe vehicle. Have you ever operated a vehicle from this period? I suggest you begin with two. I don't believe you've activated your external lighting. 2002. It was the closest I could find in theStarfleet database. Turn starboard on twenty fourth street. I have created a search grid that requires a journey ofapproximately eighty kilometres, but it's probably we'll find thembefore we complete it. What's that icon? Where? That's going to be difficult at this time of night. We'll return what we don't use. Were they aware at this time that Earth's supply of fossil fuel wasnearing depletion? One kilometre, straight ahead. Second structure from the left. Three Xindi biosigns. Five, in another part of the building. Go ahead. I've found a gate with an electric locking mechanism. Weshouldn't have a problem. Do you see the vehicle? What's this? Really. Why would anyone on the street be interested inacquiring methohexitol? Does it seem logical to you that legitimate medical research isbeing conducted in an abandoned factory? In one individual we've managed to find the worst qualities ofthis era. Greed, violence, moral corruption. Did he also figure that you'd have nocompunctions about abducting people? Is that what human life is worth in the twenty first century? Be quiet. I told you to be quiet. Does the Fiesta Salad contain animal products? Nothing for me, thank you. Quite. Engage the engine and proceed tothe second location. Drive. Don't speak until we're out of visual range. When my associate returns we'll discuss the details. You've been abducting people for money and you're questioningour honesty? Sit back. What are you doing? Extinguish that now! Now. Stay exactly where you are. T'Pol. Why would they travel back through time? Are you in a position to disable all three of them? They must have some kind of temporal beacon. If you can destroy it,they'll have no way of getting back. Modify your scanner to a delta band frequency. That should help youlocate the signal from the temporal beacon. Yes, Captain. Acknowledged. Drive. Drive. Pull over and stop here. Lower your window. Be quiet. They're coming. Stop! We've eliminated his only means of returning to his own century. Perhaps he has no other choice. If they can infect three quarters of Earth's population, it'sunlikely humans will pose a threat to them in the future. Come with me. 1"

Maybe with your friend. What? Oh, yeah. Now I remember. Small world, huh? Sure, yeah. Georgia Tandy, O negative. Come here. There yougo. There you go. It's okay. They said they won't hurt you. Loomis. There you go, nice and comfy. Are you Vaughan Strode? I'm from the blood bank. We had a screw-up this afternoon. Wegave you the wrong papers to sign. No, no, no, they don't want the money back. In fact. they'regoing to pay you again. Twenty five bucks. They just need you to signthe right papers. No, they wouldn't let me. You've got to do it in front of thesupervisor. You know, the fat broad that paid you. They sent me todrive you down. Yeah, I know. They want to send your blood work out first thingin the morning and they can't do it without the right paperwork. Youwant the twenty five bucks or not? Loomis. I insert IVs all day, I told you that. If there are anyinfections here it won't be because of me. You forget something? Well, that's not what we agreed. You said I'd get paid for eachone. We should wait a while, a few more days at least. There wassomething on the news. Cops are starting to get some complaints thatpeople have gone missing. Look, as soon as they figure out that all these people herehave been to the clinic, it won't take a rocket scientist to point thefinger at me. Look, I don't know what you guys are up to, and I don't want toknow. It's not my business. But the cops don't take kindly to peoplewho help terrorists. I gotta be real careful. Double? Tomorrow? Yeah, all right. I'll have them here bytomorrow. Ninth floor. Two hundred and eighty pounds. William Myers, second floor. I swear I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I took that from the clinic. I work at the blood bank onPorter Street. Check with them, they'll tell you. I've been there forover a year. Make a few extra bucks. There's plenty of people on the streetlooking for that stuff. I don't like cops. I've never been to Carpenter Street. I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. I thinkit's time you find me a lawyer. You heard him. Untie me. That's better. You're not allowed to hit me. No, no, no, no, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute, Idon't know who he is, I swear to God. A doctor, maybe. Says he'sworking on a vaccine, experimental. He doesn't have approval orsomething like that so he needed me to bring him people. I thought about that. Just tonight, I thought maybe he's somekind of terrorist. But I swear if I knew that for a fact I never wouldhave agreed to help him. But he said he wasn't going to hurt anybody. I just saw them anhour ago. They're all okay. Five. No, no, six. The wheelchair guy was number six. I told you, I work at the blood bank. He wanted someone fromevery blood type. Eight blood types, eight people. He figured I hadaccess to that kind of information. Five thousand apiece, double for the last three. I told you, he said he wasn't going to hurt any of them. He only calls me on the phone. I saw him a couple of times, buthe stays in the shadows. You know, he's kind of tall, that's all I cantell you. Why don't you let me go. I swear to you, I will never do itagain. What are you talking about? Yeah. If you think you're going to be inthere a long time, we should get something to eat first. Come on, I'm not talking about anything fancy. A burger, ataco? There's a drive-through less than a mile from here. Cops have toeat, don't they? What is the matter with you two? I'll pay. I'll have the Double Superbeef, no lettuce. Do it. Yeah, fries and a medium root beer. You guys don't mind, doyou? I'm starving. You know, it'd make it a lot easier if you'd untiemy hands. It's not like I'm going anywhere. Uh oh, I told you. Letme get that for you. Oh boy. You're a veggie, I forgot. Why don't you take a fry,they're probably okay. Have it your way. They'llcome in to take fresh blood samples every hour. They re-administer thesedative every six hours. I recommend you do whatever you're going todo before then. Â LOOMIS B, B negative. You'll have AB positive by tomorrow night, Iswear. Nice ray gun. Am I supposed to believe that thing's for real? Ten grand a piece for the last three and I'm not going to see apenny of it. You catch these guys and I get immunity, right. We're not talking aboutcopping to a lesser charge. Hey, I'm taking a big chance here, okay? If your associatedoesn't catch them, they're going to come looking for me, okay? You twohave to keep your word. Relax, just getting a smoke. I don't know about you, honey, but I'm a little tense. knowwhat I mean? If you want some air, open your window. Trouble? They give you all that fancy equipment and what good does it doyou. I knew your partner's plan wouldn't work. What's going on? Hey, hey,hey, I didn't do anything. 1 Those two cops who came to my place, they offered me a deal. That's the only reason I helped them. 1 Those creature, the lizard people,they're around here somewhere. You've got to find them. 2 Be careful, be careful. They've got ray guns. 2"

6635,ENT,episode 62,ARCHER,"Any new theories on their purpose? Archer here. Let's see them. Hail them. This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the starshipEnterprise. Can we assist you? What kind of weapons do they have? Can you get us through the anomalies? Full impulse. Take full security precautions. Make sure none of them arearmed. How are they? Why? They're no strangers to anomalies. That looks like an old scar. Which one's the Captain? I'm Captain Archer. Welcome aboard. I understand you've been in this region for quite some time. Your ship's in pretty rough shape. My engineer's taking a lookat it. Maybe there's some information about the Spheres we can share. If you're feeling up to it, I'd like you to have dinner with me and myScience Officer tonight. Doesn't ring a bell. We're new to the Expanse. I think we're talking about the same thing. We're here to learneverything about a species you may have run into, the Xindi? The Makers? They're certainly impressive. We've found three of them so far. Perhaps this is a subject we should discuss some other time? You'll be glad to know my engineer believes that he can repairthe damage to your vessel. He thinks it shouldn't take more than acouple of days. They believe that god-like beings they call the Makers created theSpheres a thousand years ago. Well. they also believe that the Makers are using the Spheresto reshape the Expanse, creating a paradise for when they return. Come in. Not at all. That isn't necessary. Seal off the area. Get security teams They say they'll destroy Enterprise. I have to believe them. Remember what's at stake, why we're out here. Right now wedon't have a choice. Don't take any action against them. Is that clear? This isn't over. You just murdered one of my people. What do you want with my ship? Save your breath. Where are you taking this ship? A war. That was the glorious mission you were talking about? Why do I have the feeling these heretics would say the samething. Your truth. How many people do you intend to kill with my ship? Doctrines like that make it real easy to wipe out everyone whodoesn't agree with you. You're out of your mind. I need time to think about this. That's very considerate of him. Wait a minute. Your name'sYarrick, isn't it? I understand your wife paid a visit to Sickbay. She had a longtalk with my doctor. She's pregnant. I guess you also know she wants to end the pregnancy. My doctor got the impression that she doesn't exactly agreewith D'Jamat's interpretation of your faith. As a matter of fact, Phloxsaid she's grown to hate everything about it. He also got the impression that you're not happy with the waythings are going either. From what I've seen, I'm pretty sure you're going to have thatopportunity. What makes you think that. I'm trying to stop my world from being destroyed. You're tryingto wipe out everyone who doesn't share your beliefs. I draw the line at murdering innocent people. I needed information critical to my mission. He wasn't hurt. You're proud of that. There are no Makers. At least, not how you perceive them. TheSpheres are machines built for a reason you and I don't understand. I've made it. I've chosen myself. You wanted to kill someone, kill me. I won't make someone else pay for something that happened undermy command. T'Pol's a fine commander. Then maybe you'll grant a request. My people have certain customs regarding death. There's adevice on board. We use it to dispose of hazardous materials but, onrare occasions, when the situation arises, we've also used it forexecutions. It's considered humane. The molecules have been disassembled. Quick and painless. No more than I can change yours. Ask Phlox to keep an eye on Porthos. Take care of Enterprise. This won't end here. Don't feed him cheese. Can you talk? Can you neutralise the organic explosives? I know, medical scans are against your beliefs. I don't think theMakers will mind. You past it. You don't want to do that. Not if you help me. You know this is wrong. Everything he'd doing, we can put astop to it. All of it. Your faith betrayed you. Is this really what the Makers want? To kill people by the thousands in their name? Is that the faith youwere raised in? Then do what's right. If you don't help me, you'll becondemning your wife and child to death, because that's how this isgoing to end. As long as people like D'Jamat dictate what's true andwhat isn't, all you'll ever have is war. These people you're fighting. What makes them heretics? For that, you've been at war for over a century? Found it. The environmental controls need to be re-routed to Sickbay. That can only be done from the Bridge. I'm going to show you how to doit. Doctor Phlox has synthesised an airborne agent. It neutralisesone of the enzymes used in the organic explosives, renders it inert. We have to get to the Armoury. We'reretaking the ship. We need the MACOs. Archer to the Bridge. We've rerouted command functions toEngineering. I've taken weapons offline. We've also neutralised your organic explosives. Go ahead, try to blow yourself up. I'll wait. Stand down before anyone else gets hurt. Stand by. Hail them. This is Captain Archer. D'Jamat is no longer in control ofthis vessel. Please respond. We've retaken the ship. I'm in commandagain. I'm powering down my weapons. See for yourself. We just entered orbit around Triannon. Let's go. Peace? One of my crewmen is dead, six others are wounded, myship is damaged. You want truth? I'll show you some truth. From what we've been able to learn, this happened eight monthsago. Both sides have been decimated. There are no major cities left. Millions are dead. Your faith was going to bring peace? Here it is. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

I believe I can plot a safe course. You've studied them for some time? You're referring to spatial anomalies. That Breath nearly destroyed your ship. Actually, we've determined that there are fifty nine Spheres inthe Expanse. That's doubtful. Doubt is the basis of all scientific progress. We have determined that the Spheres are nearly a thousand yearsold. Mythology often has a basis in fact. Excuse me. If you use Enterprise toattack your enemies you may prevail, but your war will not end. Vulcan was once torn by violent conflict. Numerousfactions with opposing doctrines on logic. Each decisive victory drovethe defeated faction underground until they could regroup and fightagain. The cycle perpetuated itself for centuries. Only when weembraced non-violence did we achieve peace. That's illogical. It's not possible to eradicate everyone whodisagrees with you. Captain. Main power is being disrupted. I can't identify the location. They're hailing us. No. They're moving off."

Apparently they've beenin the vicinity of the sphere for several months. He prefers the term Pri'Nam, a religiousdesignation. May I help you? What is it? Are you feeling ill? Why don't you have a seat? I was about to make some Janaran tea. Would you like some? He has severe burns! The other two are suffering from theeffects of rapid decompression.

No, the doctor said he needed time to review our physiology. He's under guard now. It's too late. Have you changed your mind? I won't watch my son or daughter fight in D'Jamat's war. You don't believe that any more than I do."
6919,ENT,episode 62,D'JAMAT,"Visual. I want to know what kind ofarmaments they're carrying. We may have found what we're looking for. Enterprise, we've suffered heavy damage. Our engines areinoperative, our life support system is failing. Please assist us. My name is D'Jamat. I can't express howgrateful we are. You saved our lives. Yes, we're on a pilgrimage to the twelfth Sphere. It's takenus a year to make the journey. It's an old vessel, but sturdy. Unfortunately we are better atprayer than we are at space travel. I'd be honoured to accept your hospitality, Captain. Our home world is called Triannon. It's six point three lightyears from here in the Maradas star cluster. Have you heard of it? The Expanse? You mean the Chosen Realm. I'm not familiar with them. We place very little emphasis onmeeting other lifeforms. Space travel for us is merely a means to bringus closer to the Spheres. We're not here to study the Spheres, we're here to veneratethem. We believe that it is through prayer and meditation that theMakers become manifest. The creators of the Spheres. I've felt their presence here. The Maker's Breath. It reshapes reality, allows ordinary men aglimpse of the divine. Well, we became careless. It's easy to do when you're in thepresence of a Sphere. You're fortunate to have such a fast ship. I regret that I'lldie having seen only one of the many thousands of Spheres. I think your estimates are a bit low. With the Makers there is no doubt. Scientific progress has led many people astray. I agree, Captain. That is good news. I certainly hope that we'll have theopportunity to repay your kindness. Is everyone in place? You sound hesitant. Do you think this ship just came to us by coincidence? Thisencounter was clearly ordained by the Makers. They desecrated a Sphere. What we are about to do is not justfor our salvation, but for theirs as well. I know it can be difficult. We've been away from home for a long time, but we have been given themeans to end the bloodshed for once and for all. Don't lose your faithnow, Yarrick. Am I disturbing you? I said before that I hoped to be able to repay your kindness. It's already underway. Captain Archer, you, your crew, thisvessel, are all about to embark on a glorious mission. At this moment anumber of my people have taken positions around your vessel. Theirbodies have been equipped with powerful organic explosives. With asingle command I can order any one of them to sacrifice their lives. Stop. Two of my men are positioned next to your warp reactor. Unless you turn this ship over to me, I'll destroy it. You made the right decision. I promise you your people won'tbe harmed. I had to erase any doubts you might have had about ourresolve. When I'm satisfied the situation is secure, I'll answer yourquestions. I also lost a crewman in that explosion, Captain. I'll say aprayer for them both. Were you given the coordinates for Triannon? Seta course. Your highest warp factor. Prepare to fire two ofyour torpedoes. Target my ship's reactor. You heard me. Release thedocking clamps. No, I don't want a victory by attrition. We're going toassault their positions directly. We also plan to embrace non-violence. As soon as the hereticsare eliminated. With the help of the Makers, all things are possible. I promised you an explanation. I owe you that. To my homeworld. We'll be there in three days. For the lastcentury, a violent group of heretics have tried to undermine our way oflife. With your ship I can deliver a final, decisive attack. I can endthis conflict forever. I'm trying to save my people. They might very well, but it doesn't change what they are. Enemies of the truth. There's only one. Your species is obsessed with numbers. A characteristic ofyour misguided belief that the secrets of the universe can be revealedthrough science. This may sound barbaric to you, but it doesn't matterhow many heretics die. When the Makers return, only the faithful willsurvive. Non-believers will be swept away. Not only Triannons, butevery race within the Chosen Realm. You're wrong. It's not easy. If it were, I wouldn't bedreading what I have to do next. I've been reviewing your records. You've committed terrible acts of desecration. Not only have you flownwithin the cloaking barrier of three Spheres, you've landed on one andentered another. For crimes of this magnitude my faith obligates me todestroy your ship and put your crew to death. However, I cannot ignorethe fact that you put yourselves at risk to save us, and that I likeyou, Captain. I believe you're an honourable man, so I am going againstwhat my faith dictates. I'm going to temper the punishment. AsCommander of this ship you may choose one member of your crew to giveup their life. If you won't choose, I'll choose for you. I take no pleasurein this, Captain, believe me. You have six hours. I urge you to use this time to searchwithin yourself, and put these lies out of your mind. All of this datathat you've collected must be erased from existence. Six hours, Captain. Enter. Ah, I'm glad you've come. I was just looking at yourCaptain's Logs. I had no idea we were such kindred spirits. I know why you're here, in the Expanse. It turns out we'reboth fighting to save our people. Our situations aren't as different as you think. And not torture? In your log there is an incident with aprisoner. An interrogation that made use of an airlock. I sympathise with you, Captain. I've had to make hard choicesas well. When I was young, I fought with the Holy Regiments. I wascommanding a mission. We'd infiltrated a village known to be a hereticstronghold. We were instructed to stay concealed and relay intelligenceabout enemy movements, but one of the villagers discovered us. It was asmall boy, no more than six years old. We knew if we let him go hewould alert the village, and if we tried to hold him he might give usaway. There was only one action to take, so I took it. In the service of the Makers, all actions are blessed ones. I was once like you, but then I felt the Breath. I prayed foryou, Captain. I had hoped that the Makers would open your eyes to thetruth, but it seems that they've turned away. You had a choice to make. And which crew member have you selected? I urge you to reconsider. But what about your mission? When I'm through with your ship,your crew will need their Captain. We are more alike than you think, Captain. I would make thesame choice. I respect your decision. What is it. Where is this device? I can't chance your mind? Very well. Proceed. You have my sympathies. You should inform your crew. Theydeserve to know. You've been quiet. I know you too well. Tell me what's wrong. And that bothers you. They are non-believers. That makes them our enemy. Do you believe the Makers speak through me? Then when you question me, you question the Makers, andthere's a word for that. Heresy. Yarrick, when you begin to sympathisewith the enemy you risk becoming the enemy. Enter. Lyaal. Lyaal. We'll use the ship'sinternal sensors to find him. I need to locate one of my men. From where? This did not happen by accident. Yarrick, go with him. Have you located Lyaal? What is it? Let me see them. Surrender now. If you had ten ships you wouldn't survive against this vessel. Run your scans. You'll see that I'm telling the truth. Surrender andyou'll be treated fairly. Target the lead vessel. Do what I say. Prepare to fire torpedoes. Target their main reactor. It's begun. What's the status of the engines? Stay with them. Do what I say! Bring us within firing distance. Prepare to lock weapons. Good. We'll eliminate them one by one. Lock weapons. Continue firing. Find him. You're lying. You know I won't do that. They're firing again, Captain. I suggest you bring yourweapons back online. Are you willing to sacrifice the lives of yourcrew? You've done a terrible thing, Captain. You've interfered withsomething that was ordained. After centuries of fighting, I was goingto bring an end to the war. We would have had peace. None of that is important. All that matters is the sacredtruth."
6920,ENT,episode 62,YARRICK,"They'reemerging, heading back to their ship. Yes. They're just waiting for your signal. I'm sorry Pri'Nam, but are you certain this is the right thingto do? But these people risked their lives to save us. Never, Pri'Nam. My orders are to escort everyone to their quarters. Watch him. A strike here will cut off their supply route. An update on the repairs to your ship. D'Jamat felt you shouldbe kept appraised. It is. Yes. That's between her and me. That's not true. D'Jamat is my spiritual leader. I will follow him to my death. You went to the doctor. You've put us at risk. He told hisCaptain. I don't think so. Did you have the procedure? It's just as well. I'm not certain it's the right thing to do. We have the ship now. We'll end the war once and for all. I'm just thinking about what's ahead, Pri'Nam. We've just begun this mission and already three people aredead. Shouldn't it? These people are not our enemy. Why? Yes. You can't win. They'll destroy the ship. No. I won't betray my faith. No. We believe the Makers created the Chosen Realm in nine days. They believe it took ten. What is it? Why? Pri'Nam. We've located the problem. It's under repair. The warp reactorshould be functioning in a few hours. They're sending a transmission. They want to surrender."
6921,ENT,episode 62,JAREB,Lyaal's missing. He's not at his station. Internal sensors aren't functioning. Systems are down all overthe ship. One of the ships has lost engines. They're retreating. Their engines are at maximum. We're still gaining. They're coming into range. Weapons aren't functioning. Pri'Nam! They're coming about.
6922,ENT,episode 62,NALBIS,"It's true. He never left my sight. Pri'Nam, there's something wrong with the manifolds on deckD, section J15. It's on the left."
6923,ENT,episode 62,CERIS,"I have four ships. You consider us heretics. We know what you do tothem, D'Jamat. Why should I believe you?"

I want to know where they'reshipping this kemocite. It could lead us to the weapon. Youoffered to help us. Are you still willing? Degra's going to discover that you sabotaged his kemocite. Are you picking up the tracking signal? But you are now. Set a course. Tell Trip I want everything he can give me fromthe engines. And? How long to go around it? Alert the crew. It's going to get rough. Go ahead. Acknowledged. T'Pol? Do your best. Travis, take us in. One half impulse. Just how accurate is this map of yours? Expanding? Emergency power to hull plating. Brace for impact. Come about. Get us out of here. Can you identify it? I guess we owe someone a thank-you. You don't seem to be having any trouble. That explains how you got here. It doesn't explain why. Why are you here? Phase cannons? How long to fix them? Commander Shran offered to send his Tactical Officer over tohelp. The kemocite signal Hoshi picked up could lead us to the Xindiweapon. We're going to need our defences. I don't like the idea ofhaving the Andorians down here any more than you do, but we could usetheir help. Good. Let's put them to work. You been talking to Lieutenant Reed? They're here to help,T'Pol. I'm not going to ask them to work with guns at their heads justbecause you don't like them. I appreciate that, but whatever problems exist between Vulcanand Andoria don't involve us. What happened? Is that your assessment or the High Commands? I don't trust them either, T'Pol, but based on my experience Ithink I can trust Commander Shran. I appreciate the gesture, but we have a lot of repairs to make. Thanks. So, how did you get picked for this assignment? We keep doing each other favours. Close enough, Travis. We don't want to give ourselves away. Any biosigns? I don't think they attacked anyone. It's Bikini Atoll. When my species was developing primitive nuclear weapons theyneeded places to test them. One was a remote island called BikiniAtoll. It's possible. If they are getting ready to test their weapon,we're running out of time. I agree. We need to get a closer look. What's the status of our repairs? Weapons? How long? If they are here to test that thing, we may not have two days. I don't intend to destroy it. If we could get our hands on thisweapon, Starfleet might be able to figure out a defence. We're going totake it. Report. Can we get a closer look? Gralik. An arboreal Xindi that we met at a facility thatmanufactured one of the components for the weapon. He promised to helpus. Looks like he kept his word. How long until it's safe enough to get close? We've got to get to it before they do. What if we shield thelaunch bay, evacuate all the adjacent compartments. Could we bring itaboard any sooner? That's a generous offer, but what are we supposed to do, cheeryou on? Archer to Lieutenant Reed. What's the status on weapons? We're going to need them. Archer out. I appreciate your offer, Shran. We accept. I'm going with you. I plan to be there when you bring theweapon aboard. That's not good enough. If something goes wrong. What happened to this being a joint venture? They're going to have to. This is my mission. This isn't about pride. The Xindi killed seven million humans,not Andorians. I won't put the fate of my people in the hands of theImperial Guard. Now, we could use your help, but if you're not happywith me calling the shots then we'll go it alone. Try to keep them busy. Let's go get it. What about Enterprise? Contact T'Pol. Have her meet us at the rendezvous point. Isthere a problem? What are you doing? Now I see why you generously offered to let us use your ship,you son of a bitch. I'm starting to think the Vulcans may be right about you. What are you talking about? You're putting Earth at risk because of a border dispute withthe Vulcans? I guess I'm not familiar with the Andorian concept of help. My crew won't let you take the weapon without a fight. You'll have to slow down to pass back through the anomalyfield. You like totalk about repaying debts. I've owed you that for a long time. What about our sensors? Their ship? You don't think I'd let your people work on myship without appropriate supervision. Give us the weapon. No, I think you're going to give it to us. Willingly. You tossed me overboard before I had a chanceto thank you for letting us access your sensor telemetry. When theXindi tested the weapon we were able to intercept their activationcodes. Give it to us, or we'll detonate it in your cargo bay. I'd rather do that than let you take it back toAndoria. I can't take the chance that you'd use itagainst the Vulcans. You said you came to help us, Shran. You canstill make good on your offer. You're not giving me any choice. T'Pol. I'd get rid of it while you still can. Shran. Let's get moving. The Andorians? Open a channel to Shran. Ask him if he requires our assistance. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Commander Shrangraciously declined our offer of help. The last we saw of them, theywere limping away on auxiliary power. You have something? Let's see it. Get it to Starfleet Command right away. Whydon't you and Trip join me for dinner tonight. I have some Andorian aleyou might like to try. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

We're damn lucky the torpedoes were all in safe mode. If one of themhad detonated. They haven't even got enough power to light a camp fire. I couldn't even guess without a chance to sort this out. We'd be giving them access to critical systems, sir. Aye, sir. Coffee, black. Yeah, no crumpets either, thank you. I need all the caffeine Ican get. What's the situation in Engineering? Worse. I'm Lieutenant Reed. It's coffee, and just for the record, I haven't left the Armouryfor so much as a bathroom break in nearly twelve hours. And you are? This is Commander Tucker, our Chief Engineer. Indeed. Well, I'll see if I can find something for you to do. Hand me the micro-spanner, please. The spanner will do the job nicely. If you wouldn't mind. That'd be lovely. Give my regards to Commander Shran. I beg your pardon? I'm sorry I wasted your time on our primitive systems. Lieutenant Talas. I apologise if I've been rude. Why don't I getus both a cup of coffee and we can align these relays together. Captain's starlog, December 6th, 2153. With someassistance from the Andorians we've managed to steer clear ofanomalies. All we have left is to reset the emitters. I'll do it. No offence, but when it comes to our weapons frequencies Iwouldn't trust my own mother. It's just an expression. Really. You come from a military family. Three, on my father's side. What? Actually, we haven't done much exploring for quite a while, butsince you ask, he wasn't very pleased. The Royal Navy was his life. I'm sure he would. Right, all done. I'll power it up and we'llsee where we stand. Reed here, sir. Torpedoes are back online, and thanks to Lieutenant Talas weshould have phase cannons within the hour. I've never gotten them above ninety three. If you ever decide toleave the Imperial Guard, Starfleet could certainly use you. What are you doing? Why are you accessingthe sensors? They weren't damaged. You're just being thorough. So, anything we need to worry about? Even with our primitive weapons? Hull plating's holding. They're breaking off. Back online. You were right, sir. If I hadn't been watching thatAndorian officer it might have taken weeks to find where she'dsabotaged the array. They've reduced speed. We'll intercept them in fourteen minutes. No damage sir. They were much closer than we were. Their hull's intact butthere's significant damage to their engines and power systems."

6938,ENT,episode 63,T'POL,"We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks. Captain, as you know, Ensign Sato and I have been working toreconstruct our database. Enough to begin piecing together a map of the spatial anomalies. The signal lies just beyond a dense field of them. A field this massive? Seventeen days at warp five. I've charted the largest anomalies, but the field is extremelydense. We may not be able to avoid all of them. Come to bearing two seven five mark eight. Hard to port! Considering I only have thirty percent of our database to workwith. There's an anomaly forming directly ahead. It's expanding. I've never seen this before. They're merging, building on oneanother. It's growing too rapidly. We've been completely enveloped. A tractor beam's locked on to us. We've been pulled out. How did you locate us? And how did the Imperial Guard know Earth had been attacked? Especially if you're monitoring communications between Starfleetand the Vulcan High Command. I resigned my commission. The Andorian shuttle has docked. I recommend we assign a security detail to each repair crew. That doesn't mean we shouldn't exercise caution. I neither like nor dislike Andorians. I've simply had a greatdeal of experience with them. Not at the moment. We weren't always so antagonistic, Captain. In fact, despite their heightened emotions, our first contact withAndorians seemed promising. They were duplicitous. They only honoured agreements that didn'tconflict with their interests. Considering the importance of this mission, I feel compelled topoint out that they've proven untrustworthy in the past. Three neuro-pressure sessions a week is hardly avoiding you. TheCaptain asked for an update on your repairs. How long until we have warp? No. Keep me informed of your progress. Two hundred million kilometres. It's a G-type star system, six planets with over a hundredmoons. There's a great deal of debris in the system. I can't tell fromthis range. Four vessels, all Xindi. Many of the moons show evidence ofextensive weapons bombardment. So you believe this is some kind of proving ground. I thought it was four to two. It's emitting high levels of radiation. It has the same quantum signature as the weapon that attackedEarth. Impulse and warp engines are nominal, hull plating's at eightytwo percent. Mister Reed reports the anomaly caused more damage that heoriginally estimated. He isn't certain. Perhaps two days. They've launched the prototype. The output was much greater than the probe that attacked Earth,but still, I don't believe the device reached it's maximum yield. Wedetected power fluctuations. It appears it was building toward anoverload. A spectacular one, but yes. It's still emitting high levels of radiation. Six hours, at least. Our shielding wouldn't be sufficient to protect the crew. Tactical alert. Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign. Hail the Captain. The two reptilian ships aremoving towards us. The other vessels are holding position. Acknowledged. Return fire. Target their engines. Pursuit course, Ensign. Continue firing all weapons. We disabled main power on both reptilianships. The other vessels aren't pursing us. It's approaching the anomaly field. They have less than thirty seconds. Twenty seconds. Six seconds. It wasn't on one of their normal comm. frequencies. It wasencrypted to look like subspace interference. Judging by the clandestine nature of the transmission, I'd guessthat whoever sent this didn't want to be discovered."
6939,ENT,episode 63,TUCKER,"There's no doubt about it, Captain. This isotope was used in the weaponthat attacked Earth. Tucker to the Bridge. I've got the warp reactor buttoned up. We're as ready as we'll ever be. No tea? Bad. The Armoury? Pleasure. Well, I'll let you two get acquainted. I haven't seen you in a while. As long asyou're here, maybe you can give me a hand. Touch this onto the phaseregulator, there, while I check the polarity. I thought you might beavoiding me. Three of the injectors are burnt out, the restrictor coils arecompletely fried. I would say at least two days, but the blue guys really knowtheir stuff. Should be up and running in about twelve hours? Is there aproblem? Ensign. I'll take him from here. Pretty well, thanks to your people, but I was wondering if Icould ask a favour. I'm told your anti-matter injectors use variablecompression nozzles. I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but one of thoseinjectors would work wonders for our engines. I thought we were allies here. Thanks. Well, lots of people lost family. I'd love to get my hands on whoever ordered that attack, butthat's not why we're here. I just want to make sure they don't get the chance to finishwhat they started. So, any help you can give us. I appreciate it."

The isotopic signature matches the kemocite that youplanted on the Xindi ship. We've managed to dig about thirty percent of our lost data outof the redundant memory core. Here. They're hailing us. It's coming in. Just before we went to warp we received a transmission from theAndorian ship. Apparently they had time to take some detailed scans while itwas aboard their ship."

And we'll continue searching until we've accomplished ourmission. We have our orders. You sound like you're afraid of this Expanse, Lieutenant. I'dexpect that from a Vulcan, not a member of the Imperial Guard. Don't underestimate these pinkskins, Lieutenant. They're stillout there. Captain Archer. Look at the trouble you'vegotten your pink skin into this time. You're braver than I imagined. I wouldn'ttry to traverse an anomaly field in a ship this fragile. We've discovered a few tricks to deal with them. We have a record of your warp signature from our last encounter. Our ships are considerably faster than Enterprise. It wasn't difficultto catch up with you. Your world was brutally attacked. The Imperial Guard thoughtyou'd be grateful to have an ally, considering no one else came rushingto your aid. Seven million killed? Not exactly a state secret. What happened to your uniform, Sub-Commander? Not that I don'tfind your new look becoming, but it's not exactly regulation, is it? Yes, I believe I heard something about that. Your world is in jeopardy, and where are your friends, theVulcans? Where is their mighty fleet? They couldn't even spare oneofficer. She was forced to abandon her career to remain on your ship. Aremarkably selfless act, for a Vulcan. But we've come to your aid. We've come into the Expanse when they refused. We're here to help you. If you don't want our assistance, we'll leave you to deal with theXindi on your own. Just like the Vulcans have done. I wasn't sure we'd find you alive. Underthe circumstances, I'd say we have something to celebrate. And your crew's doing a fine job of making them. Have a drinkwith me. You've earned a brief respite. Andorian ale. You seemed toenjoy it the last time we met. I took the liberty of bringing a fewextra bottles. To a swift victory. I volunteered. It made sense. I've had the greatest amount ofcontact with pink, with humans, and the last time we met you helped mypeople avert a war. I don't like unpaid debts. Isn't that how alliances are born? Our sensors are more sophisticated than yours. We should be ableto scan the system without betraying our presence. If I may? This is Commander Shran. Transfer our long range sensor data to Enterprise. Why attack an uninhabited system? What? I wouldn't recommend a frontal assault. Your weapons aredamaged, critical systems are down all over your ship, and yourout-numbered four to one. Even our combined forces don't stand a chance against that kindof firepower. I'm not ready to risk my ship when we don't even know ifthe Xindi weapon is here. What do you propose we do? Fly up to them and ask them whatthey're doing? Mister Tucker. How are your repairs coming along? Told by whom? That's rather sensitive information. I imagine it would. I don't know, Commander, that's asophisticated piece of technology. That remains to be seen. You have my condolences over the attackon your world. I understand your sister was killed. Captain Archer told me. No great victory comes without sacrifice. The dispute between mypeople and the Vulcans hasn't been bloodless. Border skirmishes werecommon a few decades ago. They'd violate our territory, we'd retaliate. I was still in school when my older brother joined the Imperial Guard. He was assigned to a forward surveillance unit. I can understand whyyou seek vengeance against these Xindi. You have no desire to make these people pay for the death ofyour sister? I'll have that anti-matter injector delivered to you. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Shran. Of the Andorian Mining Consortium. Restricted? I had no idea. We don't want to cause any trouble. We're looking for a rare element Archerite. We picked up some promisingreadings coming from your system. Of course, of course, but you don't mind if we finish our scans? Archerite is Extremely valuable to us. Even a few kilos will pay our expenses for the next ten cycles. We're not trying to violate your privacy. Our sensors are omni-directional. There'snothing to be concerned about. There's no need for threats. We'll leave, but ifthis system does contain archerite, you just missed out youropportunity to collect a generous percentage. Stop the scan. Take us out of the system,but not too quickly. The Andorian Mining Consortium runs from no one. It could be anything. Power generator of some kind, fusionreactor. Why the urgency? This can't be the final version of the weapon. T'Pol's analysis shows it isn't powerful enough to destroy an entireplanet. Let them run their tests. Why destroy this prototype when wecan see it in use and gauge it's destructive power? This is Shran. Transfer our sensor telemetry to Enterprise. Are you saying this was a failure? Why haven't they retrieved it? Use my ship. Our forcefield will contain the radiation. We'llsecure the device in our cargo bay until it's safe to transfer toEnterprise. It's four against two, remember? This would be a joint venture. I'll return to my ship. That won't be necessary. We'll keep you informed. Kumari is a warship with a battle-tested crew. They're capableof performing their duties without you looking over their shoulders. We'll render whatever assistance we can, but my crew won't takeorders from you. The Imperial Guard doesn't serve at your leisure, pinkskin. And you'd pass up your best chance for success over a matter ofpride? Archer's science officer believes the weapon is unstable. Itnearly overloaded. I have no reason to doubt her assessment. She seems competent. General, the humans may yet become valuable allies. Why squander the opportunity? Is this mission worth makingenemies of them? I await your orders. Charge weapons. Set a course. Take us out of the system, maximum speed. Are they following? Inform the Imperial Guard we have the weapon. Set a course forAndoria, maximum warp. I'm afraid we won't be taking orders from you any longer. I was ordered to retrieve the weapon by whatever meansnecessary. The Vulcans are the reason we're doing this. For two hundred years all that's kept them from invading Andoriais the threat of massive retaliation. With a weapon of this magnitudeat our disposal they wouldn't dare attack us. We disrupted the Xindi test, took their weapon. We may havehelped save your world. I don't need to justify my actions to you, pinkskin. I swore anoath to the Imperial Guard, my loyalty lies with them. Your ship isn't fast enough to catch us. I anticipated that. When Talas was working on Enterprise shedisrupted the main sensor array. They may be able to catch up to us,but they'll have no way to find us. Archer Take the Captain to an escape pod. Don't worry, I'll alertEnterprise where to find you. We've begun examining the weapon. With respect, General, I'd prefer you didn't. What is it? Where are they? Captain Archer. Glad to see you made it back safely. How did youfind us? I respect your perseverance, but you don't actually think you'llbe able to take it from us? I should have warned you. Don't drink too much of thatAndorian ale in one sitting. You'll lose your prize. Why? We're not your enemy. What have the Vulcans done to deserve your loyalty? I'm sorry, pinkskin. I don't believe you. Take us into the anomaly field. Shran to cargo hold three. What's your status? Shut it down. Report! Clear the hold. Prepare to open the bay doors."

You'll be able to view the test remotely from thischamber. If everything goes as planned, we should be ready to deploythe final version in a month, maybe sooner. I hope you find that worth your time. Stand by. We're confirming final power readings. I wouldn't want you to bedisappointed with the results. Deploy the weapon. Initiate firing protocols. A ship just entered the system. We can't identify it. Abort the test. Return the weapon to the launch platform. Stand by. Activate all defence systems. Contact theother vessels and have them intercept that ship.

7218,ENT,episode 63,TALAS,"Commander Shran, would you come to the Bridge. We've lost the warp trail. Commander. We've been searching for weeks. Or until we're destroyed? You've seen what this place is like. What are the chances they've survived? We should head back to Andoria while we're still able. Continue scanning. Which one of you is Reed? I assumed I'd find you in the Armoury, not relaxing here. Whatis that? Lieutenant Talas of the Imperial Warship Kumari. I've been ordered to assist you. I have duties of my own. The sooner your ship is repaired, thesooner I can get back to them. I've brought some equipment that should align those relays muchmore precisely. Is there anything else I can get you? Some coffee, perhaps? Since you clearly don't need my help, I'll return to my ship. Thank you for the hospitality. For what it's worth, Lieutenant, I'm not here to steal yoursecrets. It would hardly be worth the effort. Last time I saw weapons like these was during my early tacticaltraining. Not at all. I found it nostalgic. Just be careful when youreconnect that to your power grid. You didn't reset the EPSsynchroniser. You may singe your eyebrows when you bring it backonline. The phase couplers are charging. What's the frequency? You don't trust me. Is your mother considered a security risk? An odd one. My mother's security clearance is higher than mine. She commanded an Imperial Infantry Unit. Four generations. He must be disappointed in you. Betraying your family tradition by serving on a ship ofexploration. Perhaps he'd feel differently if he saw you now, fighting forthe survival of your race. I wish we had more time. You're only going to get ninety fourpercent efficiency from the phase cannons. And if you get tired of exploring, you'd do well in the ImperialGuard. Not by the anomaly. With all the bypasses we've been running, weobviously could have created some additional problems. You wouldn't want to be in a battle with the Xindi and suddenlyfind yourself flying blind. Your lateral array was out of alignment. I corrected it. Allother systems are functioning properly. I'd take this ship into combatmyself. It's not the weapon, it's the soldier who wields it. We have it. No. The human vessel disabled main propulsion on both ships. They've gone to warp. No apparent damage. Commander Shran. Where are they? Eighty thousand kilometres. They're hailing us."

7220,ENT,episode 63,THALEN,We're receiving a transmission from the ship. They're scanning our ships. A ship. No. Biosigns are human. Another vessel. It's the Andorian ship. They're heading for the weapon.
7221,ENT,episode 63,GENERAL,"I've seen the scans youtransmitted, Commander. Impressive. The Vulcan. We'll review her data. Proceed as planned. If your mission is successful, we won't needan alliance with them, or anyone. It's not up to you to determine the value ofthis mission, Commander. I trust your regard for this pinkskin won'tcause you to forget that. Excellent work. I'll see that you receive acommendation. Transmit your analysis as soon as possible."

If we don't raise the shields, the only that's going to beleft of this ship is a cloud of vapour. These could be shield emitters. They're not going to last forlong. What? It's been a long time since any Xindi took orders from you. We're carrying five hundred litres of warp plasma in the starboardtanks. We'll have to vent it. Turn these down on my mark. They're goingto destroy us. Now! The plasma got into their intake manifolds. Their engines areoverheating. You really don't remember. I was afraid this might happen. It'sme, Archer. You've been through a lot in the last two days. Just let mefigure out I'm human. Degra, you have to listen to me. I'm not your enemy anymore. You've spent the last two days in an interrogation chamber. Whateverthe insectoids did to you in there must have affected your memory. Myname is Jonathan Archer. The two of us just escaped from an insectoidprison colony. We've shared a cell for almost three years. Roll up your sleeves. The conflict between our people is over. We both lost. Ipromise I'll explain everything. Right now we have to get out of herebefore our friends out there repair their engines. There's a system about a week from here. It's isolated. I doubtthey'll look for us there. Â DEGRA It's been a while since you referred to those overgrowngrasshoppers as your own people. Probably because of the bloodworms. They're used during interrogations. Their secretions act as atruth serum, makes the prisoners more co-operative. But there's a sideeffect. Sometimes they can suppress memories. The same thing happenedwhen they questioned me. I forgot everything that happened since flightschool. It'll start to come back to you. Give it a few days. Three years. They wanted information about the weapon. This is going to take some time. What's the last thing youremember? The weapons test. It failed because your prototype wassabotaged. Because I'm responsible for it. Your kemocite shipment wastampered with. He wasn't too happy when I told him what you were planning todo with his kemocite. He was. In the end it didn't make much of a difference. Wedidn't stop your programme, we only slowed it down. A few weeks laterthe weapon was launched. It destroyed my planet. I don't know if you'd call it a success. After Earth wasdestroyed the old Xindi rivalries surfaced again. The insectoidsstarted attacking other Xindi colonies. They killed thousands of yourpeople. There wasn't a lot they could do. While you were busyconstructing the weapon, the insectoids were secretly building hundredsof new ships. They used Earth as a diversion. Their real goal was todominate the other Xindi species. Are you all right? It's just a bloodworm. It'll workits was out. Hold still. I think you need this morethan I do. Suit yourself. Trust me, it didn't happen overnight. You gave me this the first day we were locked up together. The guards thought it would be entertaining to put us in the same cell. They even placed wagers on who would survive the longest. I was inpretty bad shape at the time so you were the odds-on favourite. Yourpeople killed everyone I ever cared about. I was going to make sure younever walked out of that cell. For weeks we tried to kill each other. Iwas lying in the infirmary when I finally asked myself, what was thepoint. My world was gone, but so was yours. So I made a proposal. Thetwo of us would work together to get out of that place. Took us longerthan either one of us thought, but here we are. It's a Malosian cargo shuttle. They're traders. They bring supplies to the prison a few timesa month. No weapons, but she's sturdy enough to get us where we'regoing. Not exactly. When we were getting close to finding your weaponthe insectoids sent their ships after us. They boarded Enterprise andtook me prisoner, then they planted spatial charges around our warpreactor. My crew was still aboard when they detonated them. The Council? You told me you'd heard from Naara before you were sent toprison. She and the children were safe. We have a ship now. We can lookfor them. There's nothing in range. Do you remember the coordinates? There may have been survivors. Reactor coolant. The conduit must have ruptured in the attack. Take it. You're the one with a family. You want to see them again? Tryto seal the rupture. I'll see if I can close off the coolant tanks. T'Pol. Keep an eye on him. Trip.Â  What have we got? Can we scan them for a weapons facility? Degra's a senior official. We know he's designing the weapon. There's a chance he'd keep his family close by. What do you mean? It's too risky. If he suspects something, we'll wind up rightback where we started. He'll tell me. I just need a little more time. Three Days Earlier Captain's starlog, December 12th, 2153. We'vereturned to the site where the Xindi were testing the prototype weapon. An analysis of the debris may tell us more about it. Why didn't we see it before? Have they seen us yet? See what you can do about their engines. Hail them. Stand down andprepare to be boarded. Anything? What about navigational logs? Does it mention the weapon? Let me know what else you find. Not your typical nacelle configuration? Learn everything you can. I want to know where you're building the weapon. The hell you don't. Your name is Degra. I was at the Xindicolony when you picked up your shipment of kemocite. Your people areplanning another attack. I'm not going to let that happen. Where's the weapon? Archer to the Bridge. Report. What's causing it? All right. Take the ship out of the field but keep us close by. If you won't tell me what I need to know,perhaps one of your men will. But this is a Xindi reptilian. Would it work on a primate? How selective could this memory wipe be? Hoshi can help with that. Let's get started. T'Pol, I could useyour help with some of the details. If he buys into this, Degra's going to want to know everythingthat's happened in the last three years. I can't make up the wholestory on the spot. Nice work. I'm not sure about the grey. This is only supposed to be threeyears from now. You're sure these are safe? I'll do my best. Spatial anomalies. We're passing through a field of them. Holdon. Obviously not. We're losing structural integrity. I'm taking us out of warp. We'll never make it through this field in one piece. We don't have enough fuel. We should send a distress call. Oneof your ships might be close enough to hear it. We don't have a lot of choices. What's the frequency? One of the inmates told me all aboutMaarek Three. He used it as a staging area when he was smugglingdilithium. Beautiful, with beaches that go on for thousands of kilometres. First thing I'm going to do is find a cold lake and take the longestbath of my life. It sounded a lot like Earth,the way he described it. This colony of yours, you never told me about it. Why'd you live there? It's been a long time since anyone called me Captain. It'sJonathan, remember? I never really had an opportunity to start one. Iwas away from home a lot. Actually, you haven't. We're being hailed. Whoever it is, they must be pretty faraway. I'll try to clear it up. Better make it fast. At least you know they're all right. We should still changecourse. Do you know the coordinates? What's wrong? Be my guest. You encrypted the navigation controls. Do you mind if I ask how long it will take to get there? What will your people think when you showup with me. Humans probably aren't their favourite species. I appreciate that. I'm not sure. Subspace turbulence. You still don't believe me,do you. It's been years since you've said anything. This isn't necessary. Piral and Jaina. Take him to the Brig. When did you realise. We know your ship has been there, recently. You gave us the coordinates of a red giant. I guess I'll just have to wipe your memory clean again, go backinto the simulator and start this whole thing over. I think you didn't figure it out until after the malfunction. I'd be willing to bet those co-ordinates are real. We can't afford to lose three weeks if the weapon isn't there. Have you learned anything more about how they open the subspacevortices? I want to see all the data you've collected. Archer to the Bridge. We're ready. Emergency bulkheads! You're the engineer? You're going to help us. We adapted your technology, used ourmain deflector to open a subspace vortex. If you don't do what he says, this ship will break apart. Lieutenant. Tell him to do what he's told. Trip. Go ahead. Take him back to the Brig. Report. What's our status? Arm all weapons. Lay in a course for those kemocite signatures,full impulse. Get him out of here. Show him. Thanks for your help. Take him to Sickbay. I think you overdid the turbulence just a little,Ensign. How's it coming? As long as they don't know we were here, we can leave them witha mystery. Go ahead."

Perhaps you should try amore direct approach. Ask him where the weapon is being constructed. It's Xindi. It may have been travelling through one of the subspace vorticesthat they use. It's hull signature matches the Xindi ships that werehere two days ago. I don't believe so. They were attempting to erase the computer core when we boardedthe ship. There's very little data left. They've been deleted. It may be necessary to communicate with you while you're insidethe simulator. Details? T'Pol to Cargo Bay two. Increase hydraulics to level six. Increase to level seven. On my mark, initiate a sharp jolt tostarboard. Sharp. Let the Captain know. Ensign? Stand by to respond. Go ahead. How long until they arrive? Lieutenant, take us back into the debris field. I'm aware of the risks. Carry out my orders. The Doctor gave him an anti-intoxicant. A red giant. Open a comm. line to the Captain. Captain, the coordinates match the location of one of thered giants. Approximately three weeks at maximum warp. A considerable detour if the weapon isn'tthere. T'Pol to Cargo Bay two. Report. Can you stabilise the simulator? Captain, we're having some problems. Standby. T'Pol to the Bridge. Take us out of the debris field. Acknowledged. Magnify. Captain, he has a weapon. We're coming in. Perhaps he thought it would make them appear more convincing. Tactical alert. Engage. Hull breaches on decks D and E. Engineering, we're losing hull integrity. T'Pol to Captain Archer. Please report to the Bridge. We've reached the coordinates. Ensign, magnify. We've made it appear as if a plasma conduit ruptured, renderingthem unconscious. This accident won't explain how their computer core was deleted."
7236,ENT,episode 64,TUCKER,"The son of a bitch designed the weapon. This red giant might be a red herring. He only told you hisfamily was living near one of these stars. We don't know that theweapon is there. Too bad he didn't go for the Andorian ale. That would'veloosened him up. I'd love to spend an afternoon taking this engine apart. Look how everything's tied in through their main deflector. I've built flight simulators for Starfleettraining. This wouldn't be that different. How sharp do you want it? You heard the lady. Travis? Shut them down. The radiation from the debris is Overloading the hydraulic system. I'm working on it. He's got to be lying, sir. Something must have happened duringthe radiation surge that tipped him off. They use some kind of phase deflector pulses. Once they're in,their ships can travel half a dozen light years in a couple of minutes. We'll fracture the hull if this goes onany longer. The vortex is starting to collapse. I need you to stabilise it. The pylons are buckling. It wasn't me, Captain. I'll be damned. Travis inverted the warp field. It dropped us back into normal space."

I've been studying Xindineuro-physiology. It may be possible to erase his most recent memoryengrams. That way Degra will never know that he came aboard, or that hemet any of us. Their neural pathways are virtually identical. I'll need toperform a few tests, but I don't expect it will be a problem. They're relatively easy to implant. Thank you. Dermal art used to be verycommon on Denobula. Fortunately, my parents insisted I study it. I'vealso stimulated his hair follicles. Ah, but you're forgetting about the stress of imprisonment andtorture. It could very well have an effect on hair pigmentation. Oh, yes. I've treated patients with Regulan bloodworms foryears.

I want to know who you are. Why you've abducted me. What species are you? What species! You're from the Earth vessel. Prison? That's not possible. What are you doing? Why don't I remember you? Bloodworms? You claim that I've been a prisoner for three years. If that's true, why would they question me now? What kind of information? I was on my vessel, approaching the planet in the Calindrasystem. How would you know that? Gralik. He'll be executed for this. We were successful? The reptilians and aquatics would never allow that. Can you remove it? I don't understand how a Xindi and a human could put aside theirdifferences so quickly. I don't recognise this type of ship. Malosian. Perhaps we should set a course to your vessel. Is it still inthe Expanse? The insectoids were always the aggressive species, but I neverthought them capable of this. They destroyed everything the Councilworked for. It was formed when our planet was destroyed. It was created tofind a new home world for all Xindi. After years of searching we founda few suitable locations, but as usual couldn't agree on a finalchoice. Our plan for reunification was put aside when we learned of thethreat from Earth. I was ordered to begin designing the weapon. Idevoted years to it. I made so many sacrifices. So did my wife. Do Iknow what happened to my family? They were on a colony near a red giant. I doubt if there's anything left. It would have been one of thefirst colonies to be attacked. It's too dangerous. Patrol ships are still looking for us. Weshould find a refuge in case. What about you? Set course for the inner moon. Stand by todeploy the sensor drones. What's that? From where? You said there was no one in the system. Contact the Council. Thalen. I don't know what you're talking about. By capturing us, you've accomplished nothing. When my superiors learn we're missing, they'll find your shipand destroy it. What is it? Is the hull lined with trellium? Can we go around? What if the insectoids pick it up? There's a comm. channel used by high-ranking primate officials. I doubt the insectoids know it. It would be easier for me to enter it directly. What did he say it was like? It was bleak, desolate. The planet was barely habitable. It wasn't by choice. Naara was desperate to leave, she didn'tthink a military habitat was the right environment for the children. Doyou have a family, Captain? You should make the time. I've learned that our work, in theend, means very little. Our real legacy is the children. I would doanything to protect mine. After I was told of the threat from humanityI left my theoretical studies and agreed to design the prototypeweapon. When it arrived in your star system, I watched the incomingtelemetry with the other members of the Council. Seven million liveswere extinguished in front of my eyes. I asked myself how many of thosewere children. I suppose I've told you this before. Three years. My children may not even recognise me after somuch. It's one of my colleagues. Thalen, can youhear me? It's Degra. They haven't killed me yet. I need your help. My friend andI Have escaped from an Insectoid prison. Their patrols are looking for us. Thalen, where are you? Is my family still there, are they safe? Thalen! There were more than a thousand primates and arboreals at thatcolony. I don't understand why it wasn't destroyed. You must forgive me. To me, it's been only a day since we wereenemies. Giving you the coordinates to a classified installation isdifficult. Yes. Not long. I'll tell them everything you did to help me. I'm a seniorofficial. There won't be any problems. It's a diverse community. Far more pleasant than most military More anomalies? What was the problem? Really. I'm curious, Jonathan. If we've been friends for as longas you say, I must have told you the names of my children. I'm sure I would have told you I just need you to tell me. What their names are. Which one is older. You'll never find the weapon. We were told humans were ruthless, but Ididn't know you were also skilled at deception. I had my suspicions from the beginning, but it was the comm. signal from my colleague on Azati Prime that confirmed them. There's an Insectoid deuterium facility on Azati Prime. That'sthe last place my people would have gone to hide from them. If itweren't for that one mistake, your plan might have succeeded. I gave you what you thought you wanted. I doubt there's time for that. We both know my people aresearching for me. Then I suggest you proceed there at maximum warp. That's impossible. Do nothing to help them. You'll never get close to the weapon! Our defence perimeter willdestroy you!"

It becomes a clone. Come in. I had a conversation with Major Hayes this morning. He wants toput your security team and all the senior officers through a series oftraining drills. These would be different. They'd be conducted by Major Hayesand the MACOs. We're heading into a hostile situation. We don't know whatwe're going to face when we get there. The MACOs' tactics and technology are two, three years beyondStarfleet's. Why not let them pass on some of that expertise? You don'tagree. Hayes and his men have gone up against a few aliens on thismission, including the Xindi. They've handled themselves pretty well. I'd like you to co-ordinate the training sessions with the Major. What's the problem. What do you mean? Maybe it's one of the navigational sensors. Let's go take a look. Let's see it. Are there any other ships in the vicinity? Bring the grappler online. Try again. Travis. Archer to Engineering. The helm's not responding. We need full reverse Right away. Get us out of here. Do you think you can stop it? I'm Captain Archer. Your vessel has minimal life support. You wouldn't last toolong if we took you back. What was that pod designed to do? You're dying. We're doing everything we can for you, but How's it coming? Get us underway as soon as you can. Learn anything? Do you think the Spheres have something to do with creatingthis thing? Maybe the alien we picked up is the last survivor. I want you and Trip to take a look at the pod. If we can'trevive the alien, it may be our best source of information. You remember the Triannon creation myth? And that the Spheres were reshaping the Expanse into a paradisefor the faithful. A canary. On Earth, miners used to take canaries into thetunnels with them. If the canary didn't die, the miners knew the airwould be safe to breathe, and they could proceed. I want to talk to him again. Find a way. Until I get the answers I need, we're going to have to bend afew ethics. Notify me when he's conscious. We know you were sent here as some kind oftest subject. The region of space where we found you. What is it? Hold off a second. Keep going. I find that hard to believe. We found you drifting in a pod, hooked up to banks ofmonitoring equipment. You're telling me you have no idea why? That's impossible. Tactical alert. Senior officers to their posts. He's on B deck. Malcolm, status. Archer to Engineering. Doctor Phlox says you have a detached retina, a bruised leftkidney. We're in a dangerous region of space. We're trying to stop analien race from destroying Earth. We face attacks from all sides,enemies everywhere we go. The last thing I need is to hear that two ofmy senior officers have been admitted to Sickbay because they suddenlyregressed to the level of five year olds. Don't try to tell me who started it! I don't know what theproblem is between you two, and to tell you the truth I don't care, butI want it settled right now. Settle it! That's an order! How are the drills going? Archer. On my way. You weren't sent here against your will. You know exactly whatyour mission was. What were your people trying to do? You tried todestroy my ship. Why? Answer me!

It had to do with who the Major thinks is more capable of carrying outthis rescue. You wanted to see me, sir. We run drills twice a week. Senior officers are free to attend. Sir? My people are ready, sir. The MACOs' expertise comes from simulated combat, all conductedon Earth. On the other hand, we've fought numerous alien species onmany different worlds. If anything, we should be giving the MACOs thebenefit of our experience. Aye, sir. I prefer to train in the evenings. You get a better workout. Muscles are looser, reaction timesquicker. How about Tuesdays and Fridays in the evenings, and Wednesday inthe morning. I'm not trying to make it difficult. With all due respect? Is that what you call circumventing myauthority? And what did you think you were doing when you went to theCaptain with this proposal? You're probably right, but the decision was mine to make. I think that's exactly what you meant to do. As is mine. Tuesdays and Fridays, in the evenings. It's more than seven hundred million kilometres in diameter. Could be an escape pod. I'll see if I can compensate. We're losing systems all over the ship. That's all for today. Session is over. Dismissed. What the hell was that. It was way out of line. That last throw was completelyunnecessary. Fair game. These are training sessions, Major. If your men can't understandthat then I'm going to put a stop to this right now. Is that clear? Jolly good. You don't say. I started picturing Hayes' head in place of the target. Oh, no. This is a fight to the death. He's determined to take over the security of this ship, you know. Everything he does points to the fact. Just drop it. So, why don't you tell me about you and Miss Cole? You're pretty hard to miss. Is it true she's giving Amanda neuro-pressure now? I heard it was damage control from your tender touch. And why were you giving Amanda Cole neuro-pressure anyway? Well, from what I'm told, it's a pretty intimate procedure, forjust friends. That's the rumour. Right. You're all just friends. I guess this Vulcan neuro-pressure isn't that intimate after all. In that case, I've got a nasty little pain just Are you leaving so soon? It's no distraction. In fact, I could use a sparring partner, ifyou're up for it. You want to keep that left up. That's it, stay loose, excellent You're improving. You see, you were looking at my hands when you should have beenlooking at my eyes. Major. What. Because you're here to enhance the combat capacity of this crew,not take over security. You just can't stand taking orders from me, can you. Hayes! Â REED It's a little Klingon move I picked up. We're coming up on access tube seventeenbaker. Can you be any more specific? Our weapons had no effect on him. He's heading towards the centre of the ship. We need to reverse polarity on the plasmacoils. It'll trigger a feedback pulse. Turn the T-valve all the way tothe left. Let's see if you can handle this. Captain. There's no problem, Captain. Very good, sir. Think we're dismissed?"
7530,ENT,episode 65,ALIEN,"You had no right to bring me here. I didn't ask for your help. Return me to my ship. That's none of your concern. I'm not answering any of your questions. Take me back to my ship! I was sent against my will. I am not from your part of space. Icome from a trans-dimensional realm. I don't know why I was sent here. It's the truth. I was a prisoner. Because of my transgressions,I've spent my entire adult life inside a cell. One day the guardsoffered me freedom if I would participate in an experiment. I agreed. That's all I remember before I woke up here. The experiment was important to them. They wouldn't abandon me. Take me back. If you don't, I'll die. Please. What's happening to me? What's happening to me? Captain's starlog, supplemental. With Travis'sadjustments in place, we've resumed course for the red giant. You're not like the others on this ship. What are they called, your two worlds? Am I going to die? I'm grateful to you for trying, Doctor. When the Xindi destroy Earth, my people will prevail."
7531,ENT,episode 65,SOVAL,
7532,ENT,episode 65,T'POL,"Previously on Enterprise. Why would someone want to create a web of crippling anomalies? Lieutenant? The coordinates match the location of one of the red giants. I was instructing him in the practice of Vulcan neuro-pressure. What did you want to ask me. She's one of the MACOs. You believe it's causing her headaches? It's possible. Gladly. Yes. If there's nothing else. I think I have the cause. An unusually strong gravimetricdisturbance approximately three light years away. It appears to be a convergence of spatial anomalies. An object, approximately five metres in length. It's just a few hundred metres from the edge. I'm reading onebiosign. Humanoid. None. The biosigns are very erratic. There are rising levels on ammonium sulphide in the atmosphere. A great deal. The disturbance appears to be expanding at a rateof several kilometres per second, and it's location is exactlyequidistant to five of the Spheres. It's possible. This planet was once an inhabited world. It wasengulfed some time ago. I couldn't find any signs of life. A possibility. Doctor Phlox has asked me to speak with you. Corporal Cole's been experiencing headaches. The Doctor believesthey might be caused by your neuro-pressure sessions. Perhaps she didn't want to worry you. It shouldn't be performed by novices. If misapplied, you couldcause nerve damage. Under my supervision. I think it would simply be best if you ended the sessions. Theseelectrodes were collecting biometric data from the occupant. I'm sure she won't. I've noticed that you and Corporal Cole have become somewhatfriendly. Last week you were eating together in the mess hall, and in thetraining session yesterday she touched your behind. You're hard to miss. There's no reason to justify your behaviour. I was simplysuggesting you might use some discretion. It's not appropriate for a senior officer to fraternise with asubordinate. We need to get this data to the Captain immediately. There's no mistake. The pod's hull containsthe exact combination of alloys we found on the surface of the Spheres. They believed the Spheres were created by divine beings who willone day return to the Chosen Realm. Perhaps Triannon mythology has a basis in fact. It appears thepod was designed to transmit data regarding the alien's physiologicalstatus. I believe he was inserted into the disturbance so someone couldmonitor his exposure to the environment. Corporal. Come in. Please sit down. Remove your jacket. I assume Commander Tuckerbriefed you on the proper breathing technique. Begin with a deep breath. Good. Doctor Phlox did caution youagainst any further neuro-pressure from Commander Tucker? You and Commander Tucker appear to enjoy each otherscompany. He didn't mention it. Extremely low. Did you lose any relatives? Commander Tucker was greatly affected by his sister's death. You're quite fond of him. I apologise. I'll try not to press so hard. Sit up. I'm not upset. You're mistaken. Unless what? I don't experience jealousy. I am not, in any way, jealous of you and Corporal Cole. I didn't know you were an expert in vocal inflections. You're implying that I'm attracted to you. I think you're mistaken about who's attracted to whom. I don't need to say it. You already have. It wasn't you, it was your clone. Sim told me. He said he had feelings for me. Standing right there. Your voice is tensing up. I don't need to be an expert to read you. You're jealous? Which would mean you're attracted to me. It goes with theassumption. He's disrupting systems as he goes. We can use that to trackhim. That was the secondary relay coupling. Between the A1 and A3 bulkheads. He's moving in your direction. Magnetic containment is fluctuating. Commander. Eventful. How long before we can get underway? I've been briefed on the situation. I suppose I should thank you. For facilitating my exploration of human sexuality. It's one of the many aspects of your species which I've beenmeaning to explore since I left the High Command. I wouldn't use that term. Are you getting emotional? I'm sorry if I offended you. Agreed."
7533,ENT,episode 65,TUCKER,"Malcolm can be a tough man to get to know, I'll grant you that. He likes to keep to himself. This feel okay? But, you spend enough time around him, you come to realisethere's no one you'd rather have watching your back. I thought you said you weren't ticklish. Maybe I'm doing this wrong. Posture? Sure. Take a seat. I don't think Malcolm thinks of MACOs as the enemy. Competitionmaybe. Relax. This is one of the first pressure points T'Pol worked on. Helped me get through many a night. You should bring it up with Hayes. So does Malcolm. He told me that while he was in Starfleettraining, he ate the exact same three meals every day for a year. Maybe that's why they get along so well. How's it feeling? There. Well I guess I did it right. Well. That was unexpected. No. With a little warning. Commander Tucker. I'm on it. We're ready to open the hatch. I think it's a transmitter. I just can'tpin-point the frequency. What about? She never said anything about headaches. Why would neuro-pressure be the cause? I've performed it on you plenty of times. I see. You want to supervise me and Corporal Cole? Amanda won't be too happy about ending the sessions. What do you mean by that? Friendly. You've been keeping a pretty close eye on us. Look, Amanda and I just share a lot of interests, that's all. We both come from Florida Discretion. She's not Starfleet. There's nothing inappropriate about it. What's wrong? That target practice was something. Surelooked a easier than it was. Oh, come on. Your score got a lot better as the session wenton. You two really ought to declare a truce. I guess if I were in your shoes, I'd be just as upset. You really believe that? Well, it could also be that he wants everyone to be as preparedas possible. You have to admit the extra training isn't such a badidea. Okay. We're friends. Is everyone on this ship watching us? That's what T'Pol said. So? T'Pol's just smoothing out some of the rough spots. That's all. What's it to you? I do it with T'Pol. Are you implying there's something going onthere as well? Look, for the last time, there's nothing going on with any ofus, between any of us. That's right. Exactly. Just drop it. Between all this training and the extrashifts in Engineering, I've been looking forward to this all day. You aren't saying much tonight. Don't tell me you're stillupset about me and Amanda. It sure sounds like it. Why would a few neuro-pressure sessions between me and a MACObe such a big deal? Unless. Unless you're a little jealous. You're doing a pretty fair imitation of it. You know, your voice is tensing up. It's a dead giveaway. I don't need to be an expert to read you. Come on, admit it. You're a little jealous. That kind of goes along with the assumption, doesn't it? Are you saying I'm attracted to you? I don't remember that conversation. Sim? He told you that. What the hell was he doing in your room? Oh, now you're the vocal expert. I can't believe this. I'm jealous of myself? No, absolutely not. Okay, maybe. Maybe I am, a little. What just happened here? Did we? Are we? Tucker. Morning. Coffee, strong. Some night. I don't know who did more damage to the engine, the alien orMalcolm. Another day at least. I guess we should talk about whathappened last night. Well, I was referring to what happened between us, in yourquarters. I guess I'll go first. Actually, why don't you go first? No need to thank me. I'm not sure I follow. Sounds like you're saying last night was some kind ofexperiment. But that's the general idea. No, I'm not getting emotional. I just don't like being comparedto a lab rat. Forget it. I'd appreciate it if we could keep this between us. In fact, we probably should forget it ever happened. Doesn't mean we can't keep doing the neuro-pressure though."

Are you acquainted with Corporal Amanda Cole? She was in this morning with a mild headache. Says she's beenexperiencing it for a week now. Every test I ran came back negative. Frankly, I was mystified until she mentioned she was receiving Vulcanneuro-pressure from Commander Tucker. Well, I wanted to ask you. Neuro-pressure's a highly specialiseddiscipline. Commander Tucker's only be receiving it for a couple ofmonths. I thought it was possible that he might have misapplied one ofit's techniques. Well, I've already spoken to Corporal Cole about using caution,but I was wondering if you might have a word with Commander Tucker. Perhaps during your next session with him? Everything all right? Oh, there is one other thing. If you find time, perhaps youcould schedule a neuro-pressure session with Corporal Cole. Maybe undosome of Commander Tucker's work. He's suffering from a form of rapid cellular degeneration. I don't know yet. I've managed to revive him, but he's in a fairamount of pain. We were trying to save your life. He may be going into shock. His condition has worsened. He's literallydisintegrating and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop it. I don't even know if I can revive him. Captain, this man is dying a painful death. To keep himconscious is unethical. Very well, I'll do what I can. His pain medication's wearing off. Captain. They're from a different world than I am. Mine is called Denobula, my shipmates are from Earth. I'm doing everything I can. Try to rest. Please come to Sickbay, Captain. The alien has regainedconsciousness. I'm afraid there's nothing I can do."

Any reason? How about Tuesdays and Fridays in the morning, Wednesdays in theevening. You're not making this very easy. With all due respect, I think that's exactly what you're tryingto do. I wasn't aware I'd done that. If I'd come to you first you'd have turned me down flat. I didn't mean to deprive you of the opportunity. Whatever you might think, sir, my only concern is the successfuloutcome of this mission. We incorporate elements from numerousdisciplines. It's extremely effective in hand to hand situations. WhatI'd like to do now is break up into sparring pairs, run through some ofthe moves you just saw. Let's get started. Try the combination. Nice cross. Excellent. Effective combination. You were looking at his hands when you should have been watchinghis eyes. All right, why don't we take five minutes We still have the shoulder throws to cover. Okay. For next time, work on your forearm blocks, and the elbowstrikes. That was a sparring demonstration. He was on his feet. That made him fair game. It's just a little blood, sir. No one got hurt. Perfectly. We developed this specialised training system at Jupiter Stationa few months ago. The goal is to hit as many targets as you can in tenseconds. Lieutenant, if you're up for it. Fall back. Start him off atlevel two. Four targets in ten seconds. Not bad for a first go, but youmight schedule a little extra practice time. Kick it up to level four. Nine hits. That's a mid-range score. Corporal Cole here has therecord, fourteen hits at level four. Okay, lets do some shooting. We'll start at level two and workour way up. Who'd like to go next? I don't want to distract you. Always. Good forearm block. Nice back-fist. Show me thecombination. Faster on that combination. You're improving. Okay, Lieutenant. Tell me something. Why won't you let me do my job? Is that what this is all about? You think I want to replace you? I have no problems taking orders from you. After lunar survival training I could handle just aboutanything. Good sparring with you. What was that? Lieutenant. All right. It's settled, sir. Good, sir."

7830,ENT,episode 66,T'POL,"It's directly on our route to Azati Prime. Because it wasn't there before now. It's similar to thephenomenon we encountered several weeks ago. This region is being rapidly reconfigured as we speak. Two weeks. Perhaps not. Since this region was formed only recently, ithasn't been completely reconfigured. We should still be able to crossit safely. Doctor. Less than an hour at warp four. I was running a diagnostic. Do you require my assistance? Whatare you doing here? I thought it was movie night. I'll make a note of it in the maintenance log. Are you all right, Doctor? You seem somewhat agitated. I apologise if I startled you. You're certain that's all? I've had my duties to attend to. The rest of the time I've spentin my quarters, reading, meditating. I'd like to complete the diagnostic. No, thank you. If you like. Go ahead. Doctor? I don't understand. Doctor, I'm on the Bridge. This is fine. Yes, his plomeek broth leaves something to be desired as well. Quite sure. What were you doing there? I'm responsible formonitoring the engines. Do you have anything to report? Doctor? A member of the crew? Then obviously you were mistaken. No. It sounds fascinating. I'm sorry I haven't been better company. I know. It is ironic, however, that I should be your solecompanion. Unlike your people, most Vulcans will go to great lengths tofind solitude. At times it has been trying for me to co-exist witheighty humans. Especially the more irrational ones. I've found the last two days to be a welcome respite. Internal sensors don't show any additionalbiosigns. There are no lifeforms anywhere in this vicinity. You can see for yourself there's nothing there. That's possible, but we should consider another explanation. Youmentioned you were having difficulty adjusting to the solitude of thepast few days. Outside the ship, crawling on the hull. You ran the scans yourself. There is nothing unusual on board. You said you haven't slept much since we entered this disturbance. Perhaps you should return to your quarters, try to rest. Go ahead, Doctor. There's nothing on sensors. Doctor. Phlox! I thought you were going to get some rest. If that's true, then how did they get on the ship? All externalhatches and docking ports are sealed. There were no transporter signatures. We've searched four decks. If there are Xindi aboard, why are they concealing themselves? There are over eighty biosigns aboard, not counting your pets inSickbay. Neither are your pets. There must be some interference, possibly from the reconfiguredspace. I said it wasn't affecting main sensors. That hand scanner isfar less powerful, you know that. Doctor! How did he get out? And you simply forgot. It can, if you use it properly. You feel I haven't been helpful? How would you characterise thetwo hours I wasted searching for a figment of your imagination? Are you certain? As I recall, you once told Ensign Sato thatit's considered healthy for Denobulans to hallucinate. It's how yourelease stress. You've been under a lot of stress lately, haven't you,Doctor. You said you've been having headaches. Is there anything elseyou care to tell me? You nearly shot the Captain's dog! Doctor. Are you in danger? I don't have the medical expertise. I have my own duties. I can't possibly monitor the entire crew. I can't. When we were searching the ship, I became irritated with you. You don't understand. I was on the verge of losing control of myemotions. This reconfigured space is effecting me as well. I'd hoped to control it, but it's proven more difficult than Ithought. The crew is better off in your hands. You won't do that. Because your duty is to look out for the welfare of this crew. Why do you think the Captain allowed you to sedate him over CommanderTucker's objections? Because he trusts you, as do I. Just a few more hours, Doctor. There could have been some slight navigational discrepancies. Not always. Check long range sensors. This can't be correct. We're nearly a quarter of a light yearfrom the far edge. The reconfigured space has expanded. Obviously the rate of acceleration has accelerated. We need toincrease speed. As you can see, that's insufficient. We need to go to warp. What do you propose? Keeping the crew comatose for the next tenweeks? I'm afraid I may not be of much assistance. I already told you, I'm finding it difficult to focus. Unfortunately, this is by far one of my worst days. You hold a dozen scientific degrees. The procedures for restarting the reactor are in the database. That seems simple enough. I realise this is a complex procedure. I understand. I just wish I could be more helpful. Doctor, are you all right? Doctor, I can't find the plasma relays. Shall we try? What's wrong? You need to Perhaps you should increase it. Doctor, perhaps we should wake CommanderTucker. If we destroy the ship, we'll all die. If we can't accomplish our mission, billions of people on Earthcould die. Isn't it logical to sacrifice one life to save so many? The field is stabilising. Then I suggest we go to warp. What are you doing? I'll assist you in waking the others. Doctor's orders? Thank you. Of course. Commander Tucker was complaining that it will takehim days to realign the warp coils. He also said, and I quote, Phlox did one hell of a job. You musthave enjoyed having the ship to yourself."
7831,ENT,episode 66,TUCKER,"You said nothing from our universe could survive inside thesethings. How do you plan to shut down our neocortexes? I don't want to risk going to warp in there. Who knows whatkind of effect this disturbance will have on our warp field. We'll besafer sticking to impulse. You'll have to keep us in comas for at leastfour days. You need to check this every two hours,minimum. If the impulse manifolds get clogged, the engines'll overload. That would be very bad. No offence, Doc, but under normal circumstances I wouldn't evenlet you in here without four years of Starfleet training under yourbelt. Listen. If something happens, something you can't handle, Iwant you to wake me up. If it comes down to saving the ship? Look, I'm making it easyfor you. Okay? What the hell are you doing? I told you not to mess with thewarp engines. You'd better make time, Doc. I told you, you can't start thewarp reactor inside this disturbance. That machine was designed to manipulate space, to violate thelaws of motion. You make the tiniest mistake, you'll collapse the warpfield, you'll crush this ship. You're going to screw this up, Phlox! You're going to kill everybody. A little woozy. Aye, aye, Doc."

7839,ENT,episode 66,PHLOX,"Porthos, come back here. Porthos, stop. Return. Heel, that's it. Heel. Porthos. All right, but just for a moment. That's enough. You can come and see him again tomorrow. It says here that canines can bequite territorial. Is that why you keep returning to the Captain'squarters? On Earth, a dog called Scruffers travelled three thousandkilometres attempting to reunite with it's human keeper. I heard of aPycan space moth that drifted half a light year trying to return toit's home world, but I don't believe it had a name. I could use a walk. How about you? Dear Doctor Lucas. I apologisein responding to your last letter. As you can imagine, the crew and Ihave been quite busy. In we go. Iwas deeply saddened to hear about your colleagues lost in the Xindiattack. You have my condolences. It's unfortunate you were forced tocut your time on Denobula short, but obviously you're needed on Earth. Perhaps when our mission is successfully completed I'll see you back inSan Francisco. The Expanse. An extremely curious place. For example, we'verecently encountered a phenomenon that, er. Do you wantone of these? I doubt you'd like it. It's a leech, you know. It willclean out your intestinal tract. Don't tell the Captain. I apparently find myself in somewhat unsettlingcircumstances, Doctor Lucas. Although they have allowed me the luxuryof catching up on my correspondence. We first encountered the phenomenonresponsible for this situation two days ago. That's true, unless we take the appropriate precautions. Thereconfigured space disrupts the human neocortex, but I can counteractthe effects by dampening the crew's neurological activity. It would belike, oh, shutting down the main computer to protect it from an ionstorm. Quite simply, I can place each of you in a comatose state untilwe've passed through the affected region. Shouldn't cause any problems. Commander Tucker was none too keen on myplan. However, I was able to convince Captain Archer. Since myDenobulan physiology is immune to the effects of the disturbance, Ivolunteered to watch over the crew. So far, they've been no trouble atall. While the computer's controlling most of the ship'ssystems, I was given a quick tutorial, just in case. Despite the direcircumstances I must say I relished the challenge and soon developed anew-found respect for Ensign Mayweather. Every two hours. I imagine it would. These are hardly normal circumstances. I can't do that. Even a few minutes of exposure would causepermanent damage. Sleeping peacefully, except for you. Now, lie back. Please, Captain, I've told you the procedure's completely safe. Captain, I have already had this discussion with CommanderTucker, Lieutenant Reed and virtually every other officer on the ship. I'm not comfortable being incapacitated, I really should be at my post,I'm willing to risk staying awake. Well you can't, nor do you need to. I assure you I have everything well in hand. Well, thank you, Captain. I must say, Doctor Lucas, that I appreciated the Captain'svote of confidence. I had in fact been feeling some trepidation overthe responsibility I'd been handed, but after two days at the helm theship is running perfectly. Hello? Hello? Nonetheless, I'm not ashamed toadmit I'll be relieved when I can wake up the crew in two days, sixteenhours and forty three minutes. I know, I know, I'm sorry I'm late. Did you hear that? Computer, mute sound. Thatdoesn't sound normal, does it. I suppose we should investigate, hmm. I'm not going alone. Come, Porthos, come. I'd be betteroff talking to my Pyrithian bat. Perhaps we are letting our imaginations runaway with us. I should never have let Mister Tucker talk me intowatching The Exorcist last week. Hello? It's Doctor Phlox. Porthos! Porthos, come back here. Porthos. Well, now don't you feel foolish. I called out. Didn't you hear me? You could hear that all the way from the mess hall. Bangs, squeaks, rattling chains. Is this a starship or a haunted house? Considering you nearly sent me into cardiac shock. I have had a slight headache since we entered this region. Perhaps Vulcans and Earth canines are better able to adapt to it thanDenobulans. How are you? I've barely seen you the last two days. Then you're due for a night out. Why don't you join Porthos andme? The movie's quite amusing. T'Pol, I, er, perhaps you'll share a meal with me later. Hello? T'Pol? Is that you? Stop! Phlox to T'Pol. Would you mind not creeping around the ship like a Draxxan cloudviper. Please. I wouldn't have imagined that Vulcans engaged inchildish games. What were you doing in Engineering just now? I hope you don't mind eating here in thegalley. Mess hall seems a bit, er, oh, melancholy. All the emptychairs. My fifth grandmother made this for each of my weddings . Chef's tried to prepare it, but he never gets it quite right. I always thought so, but was afraid to mention it. T'Pol, you'resure you weren't in Engineering today? We're supposed to be assisting each other. It's a large ship fortwo people to maintain. I could have sworn there was someone in that room with me. No, everyone except us is in deep neuro-sedation. Obviously. You've never been to Denobula, have you. The cities are quite crowded, by choice, not by necessity. Theatmosphere is vibrant, communal. What I'm saying is that we're a sociable people. Being alone onEnterprise, just the two of us, has proven more stressful than Iimagined. Two people aren't even enough for a Denobulan marriage, aproper one anyway. That isn't what I meant. Such as Commander Tucker. I understand, but I for one will never complain again when Ican't get a good seat on movie night. Despite the tragiccircumstances surrounding your homecoming, Doctor Lucas, you must behappy to return to Earth. As I've mentioned before, I've no regretsabout accepting my position on Enterprise. However, it has struck merecently how much I miss the familiar pleasures of my home. You've experienced the nightclubs in ourKaybin district, so you know the excitement of meeting a new companionor two. The intimacy that can develop so quickly when all parties arereceptive. You humans are a truly remarkable species, Doctor Lucas, butwhen Enterprise has accomplished its mission I look forward to beingamong Denobulans again. The more of them, the better. Good afternoon, Captain. How are we feelingtoday? Neurochemistry looks excellent, theta waves are good, you shouldwake up extremely well rested. Phlox to T'Pol. I told you, it was outside of the ship, on the hull. What about alien vessels? You said this reconfigured space could be affecting our systems. What if it's interfering with our sensors? I didn't imagine it! I saw something. What about what I saw in Engineering? I need to finish my rounds. Get away from her! Phlox to T'Pol. It's the Xindi. They're on board. We'll need to arm ourselves. I saw two. There could be more of them. Then the sensors must be wrong. They were real. I saw them. They could have transporter technology. What difference does it make how they got on board. If we wakeup Lieutenant Reed or the MACOs they will be incapacitated in minutes,dead within hours. It is up to us to deal with this situation. I planto start on G deck and work my way up. I'm going to stop them whether you help me or not. That leaves three to go. They could be trying to destroy Enterprise. What better timethan while the crew is incapacitated. A biosign. This isn't human. I can't lock onto it. You said it wasn't affecting our sensors. I have it. It's just ahead. It's all right. Fortunately I'm not very proficient with handweapons. I, er, I believe I. We went for a walk earlier. I might haveneglected to put him back in my quarters. I've been distracted. I would have thought this could tell thedifference between a giant insect and a beagle. You're the science officer, you might have offered someassistance in that area. I'm not delusional. It's not unheard of, but I I'm fine. I'm going to recalibrate this to exclude canine biosigns andthen I'm going to finish searching this ship. I'm not seeing things andI intend to prove it. Hoshi? Hoshi? Ensign? Hoshi? What are you doing? I have to put you back undersedation immediately. You'll suffer permanent damage. Hoshi? What? Let me get you to Sickbay. T'Pol, please meet me in Sickbay immediately. Captain. What are you doing up? I don't know what's happening. You're not concerned about that? You're not real. You are not real! I was so busy monitoring the crew I neverthought to run another neural scan on myself. The effects are subtleand difficult to detect, but there are disruptions deep within myneocortex. You were right. I was hallucinating. I don't believe there'll be any permanent damage. However, it'sobviously affecting my judgment. I have no choice but to put myselfunder neuro-sedation and ask you to look after the crew. With your scientific background, you should have no problems. It won't be for long. We'll be coming out of the disturbance inless than six hours. T'Pol, I'm asking for your help. Why not? Apparently, I deserved it. Why didn't you tell me? I doubt that. I nearly killed Porthos, remember. What if one ofthese delusions causes me to open an airlock or shut down life support? How do you know? I'm not sure I trust myself. So, Doctor Lucas, while the past fewdays have proven challenging, both T'Pol and I are relieved that ouradventure is nearly over. Once we've confirmed we're out of thedisturbance I can begin waking the senior officers. My medical staffshould be next. They can assist me with the rest of the We should have been out of thedisturbance half an hour ago. I thought space travel was supposed to be precise. What do you thinkI'm doing. There's more than a slight discrepancy. At our current rate of speed we won't be out of this for anotherten weeks! Autonavigation is still engaged, engines are online, whyaren't we through? But we knew it would. Travis said our course and speed wouldcompensate. T'Pol? We're already at full impulse. Commander Tucker said it would be too dangerous. We don't knowwhat might happen. All right, what do we do first? Do I need to keep reminding you, you are the Science Officer. On your worst day you're more qualified to operate the warpengines than I am. I'm a physician, not an engineer. None of them are in warp theory. You're suggesting I read the manual? Output must be confined to within three hundred and threehundred twelve millicochranes to prevent fusion of the dilithiummatrix. Unless the spatial compression index is greater than five pointsix two percent, or the ship is within two parsecs of a class Cgravimetric field distortion? Complex? This is utterly baffling. It might as well be writtenancient Klingon for all the sense I can make of it. I'm sorry. You're doing fine. We have to close the plasma relays before wecan begin the start-up sequence. Would you mind? I don't have time for this. Actually you told me it would be difficult, not impossible. Thank you for the warning. Go away. Can't you see I'm busy! Fine. I'll do it myself. Deuteriumpressure is nominal. Anti-matter constrictor coils are online. Warp twoshould be sufficient. The intermix is stable. A warp field is forming. I don't know. Ifollowed the procedures exactly. What did I do wrong? What? What, T'Pol? Help me. Is it the particle confinement? How do I do that? Particleconfinement, particle confinement. He'll die. I know. I'm not willing to make that sacrifice yet. Particleconfinement. Increase power to the magnetic constriction coils. T'Pol! Here. It's holding. Engaging warp engines. Warp one point one, point two. Pressure on the hull's increasing. Lieutenant Reed insisted on showing me how to transfer power tothe hull plating, just in case. It seems to be working. Warp one pointeight, one point nine, warp two! Lie still. Your neocortex may need a few moments to warm up. Yes. I'll begin waking the rest of the crew shortly. A few minor glitches. It will all be in my log. If you'refeeling up to it, you have a visitor. How are you feeling? I'm not surprised. You haven't eaten anything in four days. Getto the Mess hall. Oh, that won't be necessary. I appreciate the offer but you needsome rest. Let me walk you to your quarters. I'll stop by and check on you in a few hours. As you might guess, Doctor Lucas, Ihad considered deleting this letter and starting over, since largesections of it are now obviously fictitious. However, I decided that mydelusional account would probably prove entertaining. As always, youhave my best wishes. Your friend and colleague, Phlox. May I join you? Yes, he gave me quite a talking to. It wasn't nearly as empty as I'd anticipated. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

It doesn't look like a reptilian or a primate design. Biosigns? Anyone else in the system? Put a team together. We'll take them back to Enterprise. Tell Phlox I want acomplete autopsy. The Major and I will search the port side. See if you can access their ship's database. More like an assault vehicle. I'm reading a half dozen particlecannons, torpedo launchers. Archer. A hatchery? Do you think you can repair it? There's a shuttlecraft in their port bay. Get it back to theship. I want an analysis of their tactical systems as soon as possible. Did you find theirBridge? I'm all right. Humans seem to have that effect on the Xindi. Malcolm's bringing you two dead insectoids. I want you to learnas much as you can about them. What about the data you recovered? Come in. According to Phlox, the insectoids we found weren't killed inthe crash, they suffocated? They sacrificed themselves to save their children. You said thehatchery's losing biosupport. How long will it last? I want you to assign a team to repair it. It's not going anywhere. This is a sentient species. We can'tabandon them. What if we found a nursery filled with thirty one infantprimates. Would you want to torch them? The Xindi are trying to destroyEarth because they heard that humans are ruthless. This is a chance toprove them wrong. I already talked to Phlox. He says they're integrated into thehatchery walls. If we remove them, they'll die. This isn't open for discussion. I'll lead the engineering team. I need you up here to help Travis figure out how to operate that Xindishuttle. I've made my decision. Get to work. Captain's Starlog, January 8th 2154. We've been inorbit for more than a day. The crew is restless, eager to resume ourmission, but I'm certain my decision to stay was the right one. Then who made all those eggs? What about the hatchery? When will the eggs mature? We've got to get the repairs finished. Contact me if you find anything else. What? Later. Are we ready? I asked Major Hayes to assign them. These eggs are vulnerable. There are breaches in the outer hull. There could be predators around. Trip. Trip. Shut itdown. What happened. Archer to Enterprise. Medical emergency. How's Hoshi coming with that translation. When she's done, ask her to search their database. See if shecan locate anything about their burial rituals. Go ahead. What about the reactor? Any way to bringit online? Stand by. Work with Trip. Help him gettheir reactor up and running. We're going to transfer our antimatter to their ship. Use asmuch as you have to. I'm not going to let any more of them die. Where's Trip? Did you bring the antimatter? What's the problem? We can spare it. We're only a few light years from the redgiant. We'll still have more than enough fuel get there. There are lives at risk here. I'm well aware of that. These Xindi are innocent. If we letthem die, we'll be proving to the others that they're right about us. Idon't know much about Vulcan ethics, but humans don't throw moralityout the window when things start getting a little rough. Your opinions have been noted. Now get back to Enterprise andstart the antimatter transfer. You may not be wearing a uniform, but you can still be chargedwith insubordination. You're relieved as First Officer. Major, escort T'Pol back tothe ship and confine her to her quarters. I gave you an order. Come in. How long will it take to transfer the antimatter? I didn't realise how badly I needed a shower. I've spent toomuch time in that hatchery. I'm happy with the command structure the way it is. This isonly temporary. T'Pol just needed a slap on the wrist. These aren't ordinary circumstances. T'Pol refused a directorder in front of the crew. I can't have senior officers behaving likethat, especially on a mission this important. My great grandfather was in North Africa during the EugenicsWars. His battalion was evacuating civilians from a war zone when theycame under attack. There was a school full of children directly betweenthem and the enemy. If his men had returned fire, they might have hitit. So he called the commander on the other side, and got him to agreeto hold his fire long enough to evacuate the school. There are rules,Trip, even in war. We have to help these children. What the hell's going on? You destroyed them? The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery. We could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission. If you'd explained to them why we were here, you might haveavoided a fire fight. Archer to Major Hayes. Report to my Ready room, on the double. I'm relieving you as Tactical officer. From now on, you'llreport to Major Hayes. You'll be confined to quarters until further notice. Dismissed. Are you done with that translation? I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoidlanguage. Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready. There's nothing more important than thesuccess of this mission. Do you agree, Major? My senior officers don't seem to understand what I'm trying todo here. I guess I have myself to blame. In the past, I've encouragedthem to ask questions, but we don't have time for that now. I needofficers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders. I thought what happened with T'Pol might have been an isolatedincident, but I'm not so sure now. Lieutenant Reed destroyed a shipthat could have helped us. I'm starting to wonder if he deliberatelytried to sabotage this mission. You're in command while I'm on thesurface. You answer to me, and me alone. Is that understood, Major? That'll be all. What is it? Do I look sick to you? That's right. We'll be light years from here before the Xindi respond to it. We can't afford to play it safe anymore. This mission's tooimportant. If it'll make the two of you feel better, I'll go to Sickbayfor a complete physical as soon as that reactor's online. T'Pol's manipulating you, isn't she. If I'm declared unfit forduty, then she takes over. I expected something like this from her, but not from the twoof you. Corporal. I've alreadyconfined two senior officers today. Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise. You heard me. You shouldn't have weapons in here. Go back to the ship. Shush. It's all right. Come in. It's all right, I was getting up anyway. Oh, I've been better. Are you sure you had that pistol set tostun? You were protecting our mission, Trip. I would have done thesame thing. Let's put this behind us, okay? What's our status? The hatchlings? It's time we got back on the road. I want you at your post. We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard. I'll be on theBridge. I've had plenty. Okay. I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands. TellTravis to set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp."

My father'd love to get a look at this place. He's fascinated byinsects, always filling the house up with bugs he's collected. Drivesmy mother crazy. It's heavilyreinforced. It's pressurising. Oxygen nitrogen atmosphere. A little stale, but breathable. Biosigns, very faint. Coming from in here. Aye sir. We've cleared the thermosphere. You might want to do a better job securing our guests. I think it's safe to assume it's dead. Do you intent do shoot me, Major? That won't go over well with Commander Tucker. Monday night ismovie night. The senior officers do have other duties. We can't all spend ourtime playing holographic games in the Armoury. Acknowledged. Deploy the docking arm. You're going to have to removethe relays here and here. That should disable the security protocols. Any word on how much longer he's planning to stay in orbit? I'd be the last to question the Captain's orders, but doesn't itseem a little odd that we're staying here to save a nest of Xindi? Meanwhile, their big brothers are trying to destroy Earth. Why so much? That's not going to leave much antimatter for our torpedoes,never mind our engines. I never imagined Captain Archer would put the welfare of a fewXindi before his own people. Do you know, he spent nearly two days inthat hatchery. From what I'm told, he hasn't stopped working longenough to even sleep! This is what you wanted to show me, a battle simulation? I asked you to look for weaknesses in their shields, not to playmore games. Those manifolds are pretty narrow, but our targeting scannersshould be able to get a lock. Nice work. I apologise. I over-reacted. A lot of the crew's on edge lately. I heard things got pretty ugly down there. I've got to get back to the Bridge. Let me know if yoursimulation finds anything else. What is it? Tactical alert. Captain Archer, report to the Bridge. Pursuit course. Arm phase cannons. Disable their engines. Torpedoes. Maximum yield. Target their impulse manifolds. Fire. An insectoid ship, sir. They were opening a vortex. They would have escaped. Sir? They would have told their superiors, sir. Given away ourposition. With all due respect sir, they didn't seem particularlyinterested in talking. I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission. Captain. Yes, sir. Stand down, Corporal. I'd advise securing the Bridge first. If Hayes gets wind of thiswe could have a fire-fight on our hands. That would be risky. If Hayes sides with the Captain, this mutinywill be over before it begins. Ensign Walsh and two of my men. They'll side with us, but Hayesposted two there. Hold it. Sorry. Well, we won't get to the Bridge this way. Stand down! Tell them to stand down. It's over, Major. Take him to hisquarters. I imagine not. We couldn't take the chance that you'd side with the Captain. Yeah."

8130,ENT,episode 67,T'POL,"The coordinates match the location of one of the red giants. None that I can detect. There's no atmosphere aboard. It's a computer interface. The is identical to the bodies we found. They would appearto be the crew's offspring. Thirty one eggs are still viable. I'm not certain there is one. Their command functions appear tobe distributed through various Captain! We should get you to Sickbay. We've located their Armoury. We found several particle weaponsand torpedo casings. Ensign Sato's translating it. We'll be ready to leave orbit assoon as the Xindi shuttle's aboard. Most of the crew appear to have died when they transferred theirlife-support to the hatchery. What about Azati Prime? We can bring the eggs aboard, reconfigure one of the cargo bays. Is there a problem, Corporal? Why are you guarding this chamber? Lieutenant Reed's report. You requested a tactical analysis of the Insectoid ship. There are two MACOs posted outside. Aside from microbes, we found no evidence of life on thisplanet. Their iconography is different from the other Xindi species. It's taking some time. Do you plan to hold a funeral? Sir? Our reserves are at less than sixty percent. Did you inform the Captain? Delay the transfer for now. I'll speak with him. No. Initialising their reactor will deplete our reserves by over onethird. We don't know for certain if the weapon is in that system. Billions of lives are at risk on Earth if our mission fails. Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed also believe that thiswould compromise our mission. I'm sorry, Captain. I can't obey that order. Perhaps we should contact Starfleet, and discuss this withAdmiral Forrest. What's our status? Our antimatter supply will be depleted by then. The Captain'sbehaviour is becoming increasingly illogical, even for a human. He'spreoccupied with the hatchery, he's displaying signs of paranoia. You can't allow him to use our antimatter. You have to speak with Phlox. Ask him to run a full exam on theCaptain. If the Doctor can find something wrong, we may have medicalgrounds to relieve him of command. How long before the reactor's brought online? You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mentalstate. You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affectyour decision. We both know he's endangering this ship and our mission. Is he still on the surface? Retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority. We'll need more people. Who's on duty in the Armoury? We don't want anyone injured. Put down your weapons. Belay that. Put him through. Go ahead. The Bridge is secure. Acting Captain's starlog,supplemental. We've resumed our course for Azati Prime. Major Hayes andhis men have been temporarily relieved of duty. Doctor Phlox believeshe has found an explanation for the Captain's behaviour. Including our mission. I want you and your men to return to duty."
8131,ENT,episode 67,TUCKER,"Target the second one. See what you can download. Maybe we can bring home something new for his collection. After you. You'd better get over here, sir. They built this place to take quite a beating. Reinforcedbulkheads, back-up power systems. They won't survive for long. The bio-support's losing power. I wouldn't even know where to start. I think we figured out what happened to them. One of thenacelles fractured when they were coming out of a subspace vortex. Theyprobably tried to make an emergency landing on this planet. Another day, at most. Captain? Captain, with all due respect, why the hell not? I've got halfa mind to take a plasma torch to that place. Sir, this is crazy. These people are trying to kill us. Captain. They may know how to make a weapon, butthese people could learn a thing or two about designing a comfortablechair. And the power grid doesn't make much sense. Almost half of it'srouted to structural integrity. Assuming you could figure out how to fly it. Give it a shot. We can't initialise the engines without them. Yeah. The repairs are moving slow. The Captain thinks it's the right thing to do. We may be atwar, but these creatures need our help. Look, there's a chance we'll run into more insectoids when wereach that red giant. Spending an extra day or two studying theirtactical systems might be useful. Just a few seconds, Captain. We're ready. Start at forty megajoules, but keep an eye on thatmatrix converter. Take it up to fifty. It must have been a surge in the power grid. I'll need a fewminutes, Captain. Tucker to Captain Archer. I think I've figured out the problem. Their power gridcan't handle our converters. It's going to take at least three days tomake them compatible. It's possible But they lost most of their antimatter inthe accident. To get that reactor running again, we'llhave to use a third of our antimatter reserves. Every system on that ship is integrated. The only way to bringbiosupport back online is to power up the whole thing. I wanted to run it by both of you first. The Captain gave us an order. The first shuttlepod's on it's way. Using both shuttlepods, about four or five hours. If you're looking for a new first officer, you should considerMalcolm. You're going to want someone on the Bridge full time, and I'ma little busy at the moment. She's questioned your orders lots of times, but you've neverlocked her up before. You have to admit its a little out of theordinary. Maybe you ought to confine me to quarters too, sir, because I'mstill not sure we're doing the right thing here. If the roles werereversed I can't imagine these Xindi would do the same for us. I need to see T'Pol. This isn't a social call. I'm here for my neuropressuretreatment. Doctor's orders. You don't want me to bring Phlox down here,do you? The antimatter's on it's way. I had a talk with him. Everything's going to be all right. This whole thing'll blow over in aday or two. I think you're overstating things just a little. What do you suggest I do, start a mutiny? What good would that do? Relieve him? Look, I know you're upset about what happened, butI think you're taking this personally. Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about twelve hours. If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in theBrig. You're asking me to betray him. Can we talk to you for a minute, sir? I'd like you to go to Sickbay with Phlox. Hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call. Don't you think that's a little dangerous? We don't know how far away their ships are. If we send thatmessage we'll be taking a hell of a risk. This mission is to save Earth, not an alien hatchery. That's not good enough, sir. Phlox has the authority to orderyou to Sickbay. There's nothing wrong with him? When Hoshi sends that distress call, every Xindi ship thatpicks it up will start heading this way. He's got Hayes on the Bridge,MACOs posted all over the ship. Whatever we do, we're going to have todo it fast. I think it's time we throw the rule book out the window. You let me in before. Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me during the last session. I think she caused some nerve damage. This is a Starfleet ship. I don't have to ask Major Hayes foranything. The Captain gave Hayes control of theBridge, posted MACOs on every deck. Yeah. That's going to leave a bruise. Allright? You're with me. Captain! Captain, it's Trip! You have to come with us. Captain! We've got the Captain. What's going on up there? Tell Phlox to get the imaging chamberready. We've got a patient for him. I didn't mean to wake you, sir. How are you feeling? Captain. I hope you understand, if there'd been any other way Still, I never thought I'd find myself pointing a weapon atyou, no matter what the circumstances. Yes, sir. We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves. Phlox says there's nineteen of them running around down there. Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along. Aren't you supposed to get some rest? I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent. Right away, sir. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Ah, Captain. I've learnt quite a bit about this fascinatingfellow. Perhaps fellow is the wrong word. Their species is genderless. They reproduce asexually. Each adult appears capable ofproducing multiple egg sacs. I wouldn't be surprised if every insectoidvessel had it's own hatchery. I'd estimate their lifespan is no morethan twelve Earth years. This individual may be one of the eldermembers of the crew. It was nearly ten years old. Without knowing more about their incubation cycle it'simpossible to say, but probably no more than a week at most. Captain,if you don't mind my saying, you look as if you could use some rest. Surely a few hours sleep wouldn't There was nothing I could do. I'm sorry. Captain, you haven't eaten or slept in almost two days. You'veshown signs of obsessional behaviour and paranoia. Captain, if you won't come with me then I'll be required underStarfleet order 104 section C to relieve you of command. His neurochemistry appears normal. This scan is hardly conclusive. I'll need to get him into theimaging chamber and run a complete neurological series. What are you proposing, Commander? Perhaps we should approach the Major and explain the situation. He seems like a reasonable man. In his quarters, resting. Do you recall when the Captain wasattacked by one of the eggs? I thought it was a defence reflex, but it was actually somethingfar more sophisticated. The substance contained a unique neurochemical. It infiltrated the Captain's synaptic pathways, causing him to reverseimprint on the baby insectoids. It's the opposite of what happens whena young animal bonds with its mother. Well, more likely a caretaker. Of course, the Captain didn'trealise this on a conscious level. Eventually he became obsessed withprotecting the eggs to the exclusion of everything else. He'll be awake in a few hours. He should be fully recovered bythen."

Certain insects on Earth are known to hibernate. It's not you I'm worried about. I've been going over the resultsfrom the last training session. Your senior officers have shown a lotof improvement, but I think they can do better. With your permissionI'd like to schedule some more target practice for Monday evening. Maybe he can sacrifice some leisure time for the sake of thismission. I'm not sure that's how the Captain would see it. Sir? Ma'am. Scenarios like this can tell us a lot about the enemy's tacticalcapabilities. Much more that we'd learn from a standard analysis. This isn't exactly a game, Lieutenant. The simulation found thatthey're vulnerable here. They've got minimal shielding around theirimpulse manifolds. A pair of torpedoes should be enough to take out theengines. Thank you, sir. They certainly are. It's not every day I'm asked to confine a senior officer. Ican't say I disagree with the Captain's decision. If one of my mendisobeyed orders I'd throw him in the stockade. Go ahead, Captain. Aye, sir. Of course, sir. It won't be a problem, sir. Perfectly, sir. Go ahead. Where's T'Pol? Hayes to the Armoury. Armoury, respond. You intend to shoot me, Lieutenant? The Captain relieved you of duty. Both of you. Until the Captain says otherwise, I give the orders on thisBridge. Contact the Captain. I gave you a direct order, Ensign. Where is he? It sprayed something in his face. Are you saying he thought he was the mother of those things? I'd like to speak with him, if you don't mind. Yes, ma'am. Not the sort of thing theytrained us for at West Point. You could have come to me, explained the situation. I probably would have."

Show me the warp signature. Degra. What about the insectoid shuttle? We could fly in, try to locate where the weapon's beingcompleted. Take them. I want to launch as soon as we can. Just get in there, find this thing, scanit and get out. Remember, whatever information you gather won't do usany good unless you bring it back. Good luck. Open a channel. Trip? No problem. I'll send you the bill. Keep a sensor lock for as long as you can. Where's it coming from? Let's see it. Malcolm. Have they sent out a transmission? How long? Target the facility. We can't risk it. Fire. We're talking about a one-way trip. Forget it. I'll be flying the mission. How soon can you get it ready? Get started. Meet me in the Launch Bay in thirty minutes. I'mgoing to need some flying lessons. Daniels. Where am I? I'm going to assume you brought me here for a good reason. I've seen it before. You know about the alien we found, the test subject? We came to the same conclusion. The Federation? You've mentioned them before. They want the Xindi to destroy us. They're about to deploy their weapon. I can't let that happen. My concern is with preventing the deaths of billions of people. If that's a problem for history, then history will have to suffer. I won't do that! You've made your share of mistakes. Send me back. Send me back now! Why are you giving this to me? I won't. We both know it's from the future. I'm going ahead with the mission. You don't think I should. That's if you accept Daniels' version of the future. I thought you were the sceptical one when it came to timetravel. What am I supposed to do? Fly a shuttle into the system andknock on the door, tell the Xindi we want to talk? The weapon is tooclose to being launched. If the situation were different maybe I'dconsider it, but I can't. I wish that were true. I think they were built for someone with compound eyes. I'll take that as a compliment. Go ahead. An hour ago I gave the command to kill three Xindi in coldblood. A month ago I had Phlox create a living being in order to usesome of it's tissue, then I watched him put it to death. I'm saying I won't order anyone else to die. I hate to add to this menagerie of yours, Doc. Just don't harvest any part of him. Do me a favour. Slip him a piece of cheeseevery now and then. I've always been much better at avoidingfarewells than giving them, so I'm not even going to try, but I'm goingto ask all of you to think back to the day when this ship was firstlaunched. We were explorers then. When all this is over, when Earth issafe, I want you to get back to that job. There are four hundredbillion stars in our galaxy. We've only explored a tiny fraction. Youhave a lot of work to do. Of all the Captains who will sit in thischair, I can't imaging any of them being more proud than I am rightnow. Archer to Enterprise. I'm heading in. Repeat the question. I wish I could help you, but my superiors keep me in the darkabout these things. I thought that was your specialty. Let me guess. Stinking up the room? Including the Xindi? Friend of yours? You must be very proud. I'll bet you didn't know this, but at one time most of my worldwas ruled by reptiles. A comet hit, around sixty five million years ago, caused a massextinction. Most of the reptiles died out. Mammals became the dominantspecies. Still, the reptiles might have come out on top if it hadn'tbeen for a slight disadvantage. They had brains the size of a walnut. That's very small. Apparently it's a constant in the universe. The reptiles didn't all die out. Some evolved into snakes,alligators, turtles. As a matter of fact one of my favouriterestaurants in San Francisco makes the most wonderful turtle soup. Youshould try it sometime if you're ever in the area. I'm just making conversation. Relaying a few interesting factsabout the world you're trying to destroy. Is that so? All right, but I'll only talk to Degra. Alone. He's building your weapon. Ring a bell now? Just tell him the name of his third child, Trenia. Prove me wrong. Tell him. Hello again. Long story. The name of your third child is Trenia. Three months into the pregnancy your wife contracted Anaproleanfever. You lost the child. You were going to name it Trenia. You told it to me. You also talked about the weapon youdesigned, the one that killed seven million people. When you watchedthe telemetry come in you wondered how many of those seven million werechildren. It doesn't matter who I am or how I know all this. What'simportant is that you listen to what I have to say. Your reason for building this weapon is based on a lie. That at some point in the future humans are going to destroyyour species. You know about the Spheres. They were constructed by trans-dimensional beings. Theirpurpose is to reconfigure the Expanse to make it habitable for theirspecies. That's what destroys the Xindi, not humanity. I've seen it happen. I've been to the future. Four hundredyears into the future. There's an artefact in my right pocket. Take it. Go ahead. Have it quantum dated. The results will back me up. Listen to me, you son of a bitch. It wasn't any easier for meto swallow this than it is for you, but you'd better understandsomething. If you destroy Earth, you won't just be eliminating myspecies, you'll be eliminating your own. That we trust each other. You're building a weapon that could destroy my world. I had totry and stop you. Just consider what I said. That's right. We're both fighting the wrong enemy. Do you believe these results are inaccurate? Let me speak tothis Council of yours, present my case. Then help me change their minds. I've made an impression, or you wouldn't still be here.

Ican't find a single weakness. Make like one of the locals? We're being scanned. I'm not picking up any vessels in the vicinity. What are they waiting for? Lock. I've gone over the scans you brought back. That's the explosivematrix. If we can get close enough we can set off a chain reaction thatwill blow this thing to high heaven. A couple of photonic torpedoes should do the trick. Four hundred metres, two hundred. He's passing through the grid. He's in. Agreed. What do you propose we do? The longer we wait here, the greater the likelihood we'll bespotted. You can't possibly believe that has any chance of success. You'll just be captured or killed. Bridge to T'Pol. There's no need to go to the Xindi. It appears they'recoming to us. Four Xindi vessels, closing fast. They're charging weapons. We've lost hull plating. We've got hull breaches on C, D and E.

8432,ENT,episode 68,T'POL," A convoy of ships is approaching the detection grid. The grid is extremely sensitive. We'd be detected the instant wepassed through. It utilises thousands of satellites. If one of them goes out ofcommission, it fills the gap. Their shuttle might be able to get through the grid withoutraising suspicion. Commander Tucker is going to need time to install thetranslation matrix. Their flightpath is somewhat erratic. They're passing through the grid. The detection grid is creating too muchinterference. I've lost them. From the moon's surface. A small monitoring station. The moon'srotation brought it into scanning range. I'm reading three Xindi biosigns. Not yet. Probably for the moon's rotation to bring them back intocommunication range. Four hours. Sir. The initial explosion would need to be of considerable yield. I'll have this quantum dated. What do you intend to do? He said you're the only one who can end the conflict with theXindi. You can't do that if you're dead. He's in a position to know. Our recent visit to Detroit has tempered my scepticism. Youshould reconsider your decision. I don't want you to die. It's not necessary. I'll be in the Ready room. Come in. I'm aware of that. Doubtful. For what? I'll be notified if my presence is needed. I don't need any leadership advice. Dismissed. Get out. Sensors would have easily detected anexplosion of that magnitude, even underwater. This system is heavily guarded. Our chances for reaching theweapon are non-existent. There's still a chance the Captain may succeed. If we don't hear from the Captain in one hour, I'll pilot ashuttlepod into the system. Attempt a diplomatic solution. The odds aren't promising, but the fact that I'm Vulcan may helpme establish a dialogue. Perhaps, but at the moment I don't see an alternate course ofaction. That's hardly a viable option. We only have one more shuttlepod. You 're wrong. You have made your objection clear. Now return to the Bridge. I gave you an order. Let go of me! I said, let go! Go ahead. Hail them. T'Pol to Engineering. Engineering, report. Get it back. Close them off."
8433,ENT,episode 68,TUCKER,"We could try disabling it. It's going to take at least a couple of hours to get up tospeed. Great, but unless we plan to fly in ass first we'd betterfigure out how to make it go forward. Let's cycle through these console settings again. Try the portactuator. We'll keep that in mind. Thank you, sir. Trouble? Sorry! Sensors are up and running. Let's get this show on the road. Five hundred metres, two hundred. Here wego. We're in. Xindi patrol ship, coming upfrom behind. They're hailing us. Hoshi, don't fail us now. We had a slight navigational malfunction that threw us offcourse. It's been corrected. Understood. I'm still getting trace kemocite readings,but not enough to indicate a large-scale weapon. And what land there is doesn't have any life on it. Take usdown, Travis, closer to the surface. Adjust twenty degrees starboard. I think so. And you said we could probably fly it inside a gas giant. Hell,it's only water. Take us deeper. Negative z axis ten degrees. There's a lot of activity on the right lower hemisphere. I wantto have a look inside. That's exactly what we're going to do. It's definitely in the final phases of construction. Most ofthe work that's going on seems maintenance related. There's room in the shuttle. I practiced on those controls. I can get her in. Captain, you want a senior officer on this, don't you? Captain? A couple of hours to get the torpedoes in place. Give 'em hell, Captain. Still nothing. It's been over two hours. He should have reached the weapon bynow. Travis and I got there in twenty five minutes, and we didn't knowwhere to look. Do you think it's possible our sensors could have missedthe explosion? Whatever you're doing, can't it wait? Right now your place is on the Bridge. No matter what happens to the Xindi weapon, the Captain isn'tcoming back. You're in command now. The crew needs to know you're ontop of things and it doesn't help if you're holed up in here. I'm just trying to help. This isn't easy for any of us. T'Pol? Dismissed? I say we go in. Get as close as we can and try to take out theweapon. We can't just sit here. And do what? You've got to be kidding. What happens if you fail? Are we supposedto just keep sending people in until there's no one left? You're missing my point. I don't think you're doing this to makepeace, I think you want to try and save the Captain. Why do I get the feeling you haven't thought this through? I'm not just going to sit still and watch you fly off and die. T'Pol. I won't let you do this. What the hell's wrong with you? That last hit took out the starboardnacelle. We're dead in the water. Bridge! Bridge! Get him to Sickbay! Tucker to the Bridge. If you can hear me, I've got coolantleaks all over the place.

It's like steering an asteroid miner with a bad axis coil. I think I'm getting a feel for her. Doesn't exactly sound like welcome to the neighbourhood. There's not much land down there. See something? You did say that most of this thing's power was routed tostructural integrity. Structural integrity's holding. Are you getting those scans, sir? The Captain said get in and get out. Aye, aye. I should be the one to go. I'm the only one who can pilot that shuttle. But I've actually done it. Aye sir. I know these controls aren't exactlyintuitive. Try again. Good, you're starting to think like an insectoid. Can I ask you something? You're the least expendable man on Enterprise. Why are youdoing this? Sounds like you're saying this is some sort of penance. I still don't have helm control."

It extends fifty thousand light years in alldirections, and it is growing. I know, in the Expanse. He belongs to the same race that built the Spheres. They'realtering this space to make it habitable for their species. It's aprelude to invasion. It's getting harder and harder to surprise you, Captain. I've brought you to a monumental moment inhistory, the battle of Procyon Five, where the Federation engaged theSphere Builders. Vulcans, Andorians, Ithenites, Klingons. Dozens of species,including humans, all unified in a powerful alliance. Sphere Builders. The Federation wins thebattle, they drive the enemy back into their trans-dimensional realm. If the Federation had lost, the Sphere Builders would have spreadthroughout the galaxy. They would have wiped out everything. Thisspecies has technology which allows them to examine alternatetimelines. They've seen this future and they want to change theoutcome, so they contacted the Xindi and convinced them that humanitywas a dangerous threat. Without humanity, the Federation will never exist. You have tomake the Xindi understand that humanity isn't the enemy. In fact, it'shumanity that will protect them from the Sphere Builders when thisbattle is won. Contact them. Make peace. I know. If you destroy their weapon they will only build another. Youare the only one who can convince them of what I have told you. It iscrucial to history that you do not sacrifice yourself. Send someone else. Captain, you have to believe me. You are making a catastrophicmistake. This isn't one of them. Take this. It's Xindi. A family medal thatbelongs to one of the crewmen on this ship.

What exactly are you proposing? You were captured behind the controls of a ship armed withexplosives, and you're asking for our trust? And now that your mission's failed, you want to negotiate. You maintain that by destroying your world we'll be ensuringour own annihilation. Because it's humankind that ultimately saves the Xindi fromthese Sphere Builders. I'm afraid it'll take more than this antique to convince us. You haven't changed ours. I'll assemble the Council."
8655,ENT,episode 68,DEGRA,"It may seem odd to celebrate the completion of a weapon,particularly one designed to destroy an entire planet, but recall thewords of Enarchis written some fifty years into the Great Diaspora. Without a world of our own we are but children lost in the wilderness. One day we'll emerge from this wilderness, and our work here willensure that we'll never be lost again. To a new era for all Xindi. Welcome. Momentarily. Patience. We'll have to generate an extremely large vortex to accommodatethat many vessels. A vortex of that size will be very unstable. You could lose oneor more vessels. A message for you. It's not him. That one only killed seven million. This one will destroy anentire world. That's what I keep telling myself, but the reality is that agood number of the dead will be innocents, and children. It's best not to think about it. It's difficult when you have children of your own. I wonder how they'll remember us. How do you know me? Repeat what you told him. Leave me alone with him, and take him as well. I've never told that to anyone. Who are you? Continue. What lie would that be? That is not a lie! Of course. I've studied the Spheres. There is no evidence to support whatyou're saying. You expect me to believe that? An initiation medal. You could have gotten it anywhere. The quantum dating confirms it. It's fromthe future. It also means she's been dealing with the Reptilians secretly. He said he saw Reptilians on Earth, in a place called Detroit,over a hundred years in the past. According to the human, they were developing a bioweapon. He spoke of it in great detail. If the Reptilians wanted to keeptheir actions a secret, the past would be a good place to do it. She may have taken them. And quickly. The weapon's been moved to a safe location, butit's nearly ready to be deployed. We may not know who the real enemy is. Quantum dating has produced inaccurate results before. Some members of the Council would sooner execute you thanlisten. We're not finished. We've been discussing other matters. We're not going anywhere. You can't threaten us. What about him? You agreed to hold off. Call off your vessels."

It's difficult when you have children of your own. What we do is for them, for our children's future. Rememberthat. It also means she's been dealing with the Reptilians secretly. The past.

I intend to hunt down and eradicate everyrefugee caravan, every colony, every last outpost they have. See that we don't. Go ahead. Send a patrol. We will resume this when I return. Answer the question. How many Earth vessels have entered the Expanse? Is this a pre-emptive strike? You don't want to know my specialty. I had no idea that humans were so resilient. It's not atrait found in most primate species. There's a reason reptilians are called upon when force mustbe applied. It was a reptilian who piloted the weapon that attackedyour world. He was from my regiment. I selected him myself. His name will go down in history. It will be spoken withreverence, a testament to the superiority of the cold-blooded. I wasn't aware of that. How unfortunate. And what was that? Earthvessels. How many? You want me to kill you? I'll reciprocate with an interesting fact of my own. We knowexactly where your ship is. When we lost contact with our lunar outpost, we scanned thevicinity and discovered it hiding. Unless you tell me exactly what Iwant to know I'll dispatch a squadron right now. No more conversation? I hope you had a chance to say goodbye to your crew. Degra? I don't know who that is. What makes you think Degra would be interested in talking toyou? Degra has only two children. Restrain him. You've had enough time. Has herevealed the location of his forces? There are no other matters. Take them back to their ship. Return to your ship. He's going to a detention centre for more questioning. Ifthere are any survivors from his ship, they'll join him. Your ship's under attack. We grew tired of waiting. I don't answer to you.

They were constructed bytrans-dimensional beings. Their purpose is to reconfigure the Expanseto make it habitable for their species. That's what destroys the Xindi,not humanity. Where are you taking me? How many have we lost? Don't waste time on me. Have Hoshi and Travis start analysing that pod. I was aboard one of their ships. That's the last thing Iremember. I think I may have gotten through to one of them. Degra. Thanks. Are youall right? They're not exactly unified. The reptilians came after us ontheir own. They might decide to finish what they started. T'Pol? How far away is it? Thanks for the warning. How far? Set a course. Let's focus on getting ourselves operational. We can't mount asearch with a ship coming down on our heads. Who? He may not be on our side, but I get the feeling he's startingto question his. Go ahead. Any details? How long till they get here? Set a rendezvous course. Maybe we can help each other. Can you get us through them? Hail them. This is Captain Archer. We're responding to yourdistress call. We've run into them before. We'll see what we can do. What brings you to this system? Actually, this is all the result of combat. Have you heard of a species called the Xindi? Let's talk about your ship. We know a way to insulate againstthe anomalies. There's a substance called trellium-D. I have sixty kilos sitting in my cargo bay. That's what I had in mind. Our warp engine is badly damaged. I was thinking more along the lines of a warp coil. Maybe we can make it worth your while. We have certaintechnology that you'd probably find useful. The Xindi have already wiped out seven million of my people. Now they're building a weapon to destroy our entire world. I have tostop them. Without warp drive, I won't succeed. The names of these supervisors. Piral, Jaina, Trenia. It's not a star system. How far away are the coordinates? It's hard to imagine that we'll ever get this ship back to theway it was. How long have you been a doctor? And in all that time, did you ever do anything you thought wasunethical? I'm about to step over a line, a line I thought I would nevercross. And given the nature of our mission, it probably won't be thelast. There could be more casualties. Put together an armed boarding party. The alien ship we docked with. We need their warp coil. They won't give it to us, so we'regoing to have to take it. Get your men together! Let's make sure they don't get any lucky shots. We can't risk tipping them off. We have to take them bysurprise. That'll reduce the losses on both sides. We'll disable theirship as quickly as we can, beam over, extract the warp coil and getout, hopefully without any casualties. Set a course. Not right now. If I had another option, I'd take it. We're a lot different. We're going to leave them a supply of trellium, along with someextra food. I'm not saying it'll be easy for them, but they'll stand adecent chance of making it home. Not if we do it right. We can debate this all day. I've made my decision. I'm no happier doing this than you are, but we're not going tomake a habit of it. I'm not rationalising anything. I know full well what I'mdoing. We don't have a choice. We've had our share of disagreements, but you've never taken itout on my desk before. What's happening to you? Maybe you should find the time. I'm glad to hear it. I'll be leading the boarding party. There's no margin for error. If we don't do this right, people aregoing to die. We need you on the Bridge. Archer to T'Pol. We're approaching the vessel. Report to the Bridge. You have the Bridge. Stun grenade. Go! Cover. Archer. Go ahead. There's a forcefield around the warp coil. Trip's trying to disable it. Archer to Enterprise. Parson's been hit. Lock onto her comm. signal and beam her out of here. Archer. Stand by to beam us out. Fall back. We've beamed three containers of trellium into your cargo holdas compensation. There's also food and supplies. Because I have no choice. Energise. What's our top speed. It seems the longer we're out here, the more I have to keepsaying that to myself. Captain to the Bridge. Prepare to go to maximum warp."

The comm. system's still down. We don't havea complete casualty list yet. So far the news isn't good. Five peopleare confirmed dead, a dozen wounded. Most of the hull breaches havebeen contained with emergency bulkheads. I don't know. There's no way to get to it. A large portion of Edeck is still decompressed. The aft torpedo launcher's working, but that's about it. I reallydon't know what's holding us together, but let's hope it doesn't giveout. Indeed. We've already lost one Captain today. Emergency power's back online. We'll havephase cannons in about an hour. I'll have to pull people from other areas. Aye. It's Xindi. Targeting. It appears to be a one-man vessel. No armaments. One. Here. They went to a lot of trouble to let you go. Do you really think they'll attack us again? We've run out of moons to hide behind, but there is a cometarydust cloud not too far off. At present speed, about three days. They have minimal weapons, all powered down. Who are we boarding, sir? I don't understand. Captain. Under normal circumstances they'd be nomatch for us, but we've sustained a lot more damage than they have. This could be risky. How long? If they fight back, ten minutes could be a very long time. Aye. Their warp drive's offline. They're charging weapons. They're firing. Their weapons are at fifty percent. We have to take out their weapons! If we want to get through this in one piece, we may have nochoice. They're targeting our starboard nacelle. We're venting atmosphere on C deck. T'Pol! Got it. Go ahead.

8735,ENT,episode 69,T'POL,"Ensign, get us out of here. What about Cargo Bay two? Weapons? Commander. How long? Impulse? Make it a priority. I'd like you to begin repairs on E deck. There are engineering components in Cargo Bay two. They'recrucial to Commander Tucker's repairs. Aft torpedoes. The viewscreen? Biosigns? Bring it in. Damage report. We'll have impulse power insix hours. Aft torpedo launchers and one forward phase cannon areonline. Its configuration suggests it's aquatic. Do you have any idea why they released you? I'm fine. I should help Lieutenant Reed with his repairs. The diamagnetic field should shield us from long range scans. Our sensors are still offline. Bridge to Captain Archer. There's an unidentified vessel approaching. They're askingfor our assistance. Just that they've taken heavy damage. Twelve minutes. I'm detecting numerous spatial anomalies in the area. I believe so. I discovered a set of coordinates embeddedin the document. There was another embedded number. A stardate, three days fromnow. Four light years. We'll need at least warp three to make it intime. It's unlikely that Degra will wait beyond three days. Perhaps we should reconsider negotiation. Can I have a word with you? We are no different than the marauders who attacked us when weentered the Expanse. By stealing their warp coil we could be condemning them todeath. You're forgetting that we're in a dangerous region of space. Ourassault could cripple their ability to defend themselves. And what if something goes wrong? We can't save humanity without holding on to what makes ushuman. Those were your words to me. Once you rationalise the first mis-step, it's easy to fall intoa pattern of behaviour. I can't justify this course of action. I won't let you do it! I apologise. It's been a difficult few days. I haven't had the time tomeditate. I didn't mean what I said. Understood. Doctor. Three months. When I was exposed to trellium aboard the Seleya, it affected mein a way that I wasn't prepared for. The initial effects were overwhelming, but as they began to wearoff I discovered I was able to access certain emotions. I wanted more. I began to experiment by ingesting small amounts of trellium. I deviseda way to inject it into my bloodstream. I thought, in small amounts, it would be safe. At first, I wasable to control the new emotions. My interactions with the crewimproved. Two days ago. The damage to E deck made it impossible to accessthe cargo bay. I began experiencing agitation, anxiety, withdrawalsymptoms. I was able to retrieve the trellium. I was almost killed in theprocess. I understand. Go ahead. I'm on my way. The Captain needs me. I have to go. Are you going to discuss this with the Captain? Good luck. Stand by weapons. Target their propulsion systems. Fire. Bridge to transporter. Energise. We can't leave them defenceless. The Captain's orders. Evasive manoeuvres. T'Pol to the Captain. We're taking heavy damage. Go ahead. Lieutenant. Adjust phase cannons to a narrow confinement beam. Target thispower juncture. Fire! Commander Tucker's aboard. We have it. I'm not sure why I asked you to come seeme. Perhaps. I thought that without the trellium I would no longer havedifficulty suppressing my emotions, but that's not true. And if they're not? I'm not certain I'll be able to. I'm Vulcans don't experience fear."
8736,ENT,episode 69,TUCKER,"The primary warp coil's fried. It has to be rebuilt fromscratch. A couple of weeks, if we had the parts. We don't. As it standsnow, warp drive's out of the question. I'll have to inspect the hull around the exhaust manifolds, seethe damage first-hand. We've had a lot of injuries down here. It could speed things upif you assign me some extra help. Engineering isn't the safest place to be rightnow. Instead of hiding, shouldn't we be looking for the weapon? What makes you think we can trust thisguy? Degra. He seems like the last person who'd come around to ourside. I mean, he designed the weapon. Well, let's hope you're right. I think we're ready to fire thisup. Maybe not. Join the club. One lucky shot to our starboard nacelle It's tied into their injector system. If we use thetransporter, we'd destroy their engines. I've got to get in there,decouple it by hand. Ten minutes, give or take. Can't tell for sure until I see it. That's the access port. Captain. We've hit a little snag. Try it now. Right there. A few tweaks and it fit right in. Three point two. That should get us to the rendezvous pointwith time to spare. You did the right thing. Those people'll be okay. They'll get home."

It's a simple matter of repairs. Well, perhaps not that simple. Somehow, I don't think it's the damage to Enterprise that's troublingyou. Nearly forty years. Twice. Why? Probably not. May I ask what you're planning to do? I'll be ready. Yes, this will just take a moment. What isit? There's a good deal of residual trelliumin your bloodstream. How long have you been doing this? I need to know precisely what has been happening. As I recall, you were homicidal and paranoid. You must have known it was dangerous. Trellium exposure isdeadly to Vulcans. It eats away at the neural pathways. Commander Tucker, for example. When did you realise you werebecoming addicted? You're not experiencing them now. This will help stabilise your synaptic pathways, but thewithdrawal symptoms will return in a few days. It's going to take time. It won't be easy. You should remain here for observation. I expect you to report back here at the first sign of trouble. This is between you and your doctor. Perhaps you just needed some company. How do you feel? It's not surprising that there are residual effects. They'reprobably temporary. Then you'll learn to cope with them. Afraid? You sought these emotions. Don't expect them to vanishovernight.

9026,ENT,episode 69,BUILDER,"Where are the other members of the Council? Why? There's distrust amongst you. Continue. Who told you this? You want to know if they had my help. Yes. After you prohibited them from constructing thebioweapon, the reptilians and the insectoids were prepared to withdrawfrom the Council. I assisted them so the Council would remain unified. I protected your authority by keeping the Council intact. It was never completed, and the three reptilians were neverfound. There are limits to what we can do in your realm. What makes you think you can subject me to this interrogation? If it weren't for my assistance, your species would be facingdestruction. Then prove it. Focus on the task at hand. The weapon is nearlycomplete. If you permit yourselves to become distracted, you'll fail todestroy your real enemy. The enemy of all Xindi. Don't summon me againunless every member of the Council is present. I won't help fuel yourinternal bickering."
9027,ENT,episode 69,CREW,"Sir, there's a vessel approaching. It's the Earth ship. They're not responding."
9028,ENT,episode 69,ILLYRIAN,"Thank you for coming, but be aware. This region containsdangerous spatial distortions. They've damaged our engines and life support. We wouldappreciate whatever assistance you can give us. Curiosity. We're studying the red giant. It's thefirst one we've had the opportunity to explore. We weren't prepared forthese spatial anomalies as you call them. Seems you weren't either. Combat? No. We're new to this region of space. I've heard of it. It's extremely rare. Perhaps we can work out some sort of trade. Given the condition of my vessel, I don't know what we canoffer you. We could probably spare a few plasma injectors, maybe someantimatter. I'm afraid that's one thing we can't spare. Without a warp coil, the journey back to our system wouldtake three years. We're not equipped for a voyage of that length. I sympathise, Captain. I will help you in any other way, butI won't jeopardize the lives of my crew. I'm sorry. Run another test. If it doesn't hold,we'll have to bypass the entire assembly. What is it? Have you contacted them? What you can't have, you take by force? You're stranding us three years from home. Why are you doingthis?"

9031,ENT,episode 70,ARCHER,"If you destroy Earth you won't just be eliminating my species, you'll be eliminating your own. I think I may have gotten through to one of them. Degra. We're in bad shape, I can't deny that, but we're still in one piece. Enterprise is a tough ship. She took more than anyone could ask her to and then some, and so have all of you. I wanted to say thank you. I only wish I could thank the eighteen crewmen who were lost. Like you, they understood how important our mission is and they accepted the risks. We came into the Expanse not knowing what we'd find, with no one to rely on but ourselves, but we're going to succeed, to accomplish our mission, for everyone on Earth who's relying on us, and for the eighteen. What's our status on weapons? That'll have to do. And I don't intend to be late. I've made my decision. We have a lot of work to do. I suggest we get to it. Commander. Crewman Taylor was one of yours, wasn't she? I'd like you to write a letter to her family. I asked you. It doesn't have to be long. Her family deserves to know what happened to her. Hoshi. Tactical alert! Stand by, Trip. Get us out of here. Stay with him, Travis. Then you also called off the attack on Enterprise? You've taken a big risk. Everything I've told you is true. That might be a bit difficult, but if you come aboard my ship I can give you all the proof you want. But there are some things I want to know first. When will your weapon be launched? Weeks? Days? I'm trying to help you, but I need to know my world isn't being destroyed while I'm doing it. A friend of yours? They're the ones we found on Earth, in the past. They were about to release a bioweapon that would have decimated the population. Apparently he decided to go ahead without your Council's approval. I already told you. We had help, just like they did. You need more evidence. They had this with them. We destroyed the toxin, but my doctor kept a sample of it in stasis. Have them come aboard, perform whatever test they'd like. Come with me. Archer to Doctor Phlox. I need you in Sickbay. We found him adrift. Do you recognise his species? Some kind of cellular degeneration. It started the moment he was taken off his ship. That's why his species built the Spheres, to make our space more compatible for themselves. We're destined to form an alliance to stop them, but if you destroy Earth that'll never happen. You'll be condemning your own race to extinction. How are the repairs coming. Why don't you join me in my Ready room until they're finished. Let's stick to the job at hand. We'll need to shut down the main plasma feeds. Get going. Archer to Trip. You've got less than six minutes. Malcolm Get back to the airlock. That's an order. Malcolm. Trip. That's enough. I said that's enough! We've determined there are fifty nine of them. Seventy eight? I apologise for Mister Tucker. I know. Believe it or not, we've had this conversation before. Erasing your memory probably wasn't the best way to earn your trust. Maybe I can help. The first Sphere we came across was damaged. There was a breach in the outer shell. Enterprise was designed to be a ship of exploration. Report. On screen. Did you invite anyone else? What kind of weapons do you have? If we work together, we might be able to disable them. Are you familiar with the design of that ship? At least we'd stand a chance. Fire. Evasive manoeuvres. Keep firing. Target their weapons. Open a channel to Degra. Even the reptilians? This is nearly a dozen light years away. It'll take us weeks to get there. Will it be soon enough to stop the weapon? Thanks for the warning. See you in three days."

Reports of injuries on B deck. No one's out there, sir. That's very close to the fire. That'd be me, sir. Where's the other valve? Commander, I have a problem. I think the heat's warped the metal. The panel won't open. This is going to take a while. Almost there. I'm almost finished, Captain. I'm sorry sir, you're breaking up. There's no time. Do what you have to do so I can shut this down. Tactical alert. All hands to stations. Reptilians. We don't stand a chance against them. Not in the shape we're in. They're charging weapons. Then you know where they're vulnerable, where to target our weapons. He's knocked out their shield generators. Their weapons are down. Degra was spot on. He knew exactly where to hit them. Sir, he's charging weapons!"

9042,ENT,episode 70,T'POL,"Do you have any idea why they released you? When I was exposed to trellium, it affected me in a way I wasn't prepared for. I discovered I was able to access certain emotions. I wanted more. I devised a way to inject it into my bloodstream. That accounts for everyone. Mister Reed has both forward phase cannons back online in addition to the aft torpedo launchers. Hull plating is up to eighty percent. Degra's message was clear. We're to meet him ten hours from now. You're busy. I'll come back. None. These emotions have grown more difficult to control. My usual techniques for suppressing them haven't been effective. Are you saying these emotions may never subside? It's a spatial anomaly. We've entered a dense field. Captain. Pepperoni pizza. Damage reports? I'm sure they'll appreciate that. When was the last time you slept? That was two days ago. Go to your quarters. Get some sleep. I could order you. We've been working to reconstruct our database. Increase the data resolution. Commander. Commander! The Captain is trying to gain Degra's trust. It must have ruptured when our sensors were offline. The manifold pressure is increasing. We have less than six minutes before the fire reaches the reactor shielding. He's too close to the fire. His EV suit can't compensate. The forward valve is closed. We've detected a ship. They've just passed through the cloaking barrier. The Reptilian ship has been destroyed. Crewman Rostov said I'd find you here. You might find this useful. Portable power cells. Is there anything I can help you with? You think that the loss of a colleague or friend doesn't affect us? It does. But if we give in to those emotions, they overwhelm us. You're the ones to be envied."
9043,ENT,episode 70,TUCKER,"Elizabeth, get out of there! We managed to get into sections six and seven on C deck. We found Taylor and Kamata. We could wait, hang back until we've had a chance to make more repairs. Maybe that's what he's counting on. Lure us into an ambush while we're still licking our wounds. Aye sir. She was an control specialist, a damn good one. She worked on Rostov's team. I can ask him. I'm barely holding the ship together. I don't have time to sit down to and write a letter. Understood. Tucker to the Bridge. This is not the best time for this. What'd you get? Don't worry, you can pick the pepperoni off. No, the Captain wants me to write a letter to Crewman Taylor's family. Their daughter's dead. Do you really think they'll care what I have to say? I don't know. Not since the attack. All right then, two days. Believe me, I'd love to. I don't have time. We're full of holes. The only thing keeping us flying is a stolen warp coil, and now I've got to write this letter. What the hell? Tucker to Engineering. Shut down the auxiliary coolant line between sections twelve and fourteen on E deck. Tucker to Sickbay. Medical emergency on E deck, section twelve. Reactor pressure's holding. Good thing I wasn't taking a nap. There's a microfracture in the magnesium jacket. That's why it ruptured. Tell it to the man lying in Sickbay! Test them again, all of them. I'm a little busy, Doc. T'Pol tattling on me now? Well, I appreciate that, but I'm trying to hold this ship together with spit and baling wire. Your concern is duly noted, Doc, but I've got to get back to work. Come again? Six hours? I can give you two hours. If I'm gone longer than three there may not be a ship here when I get back. Done. And remind me never to buy a car from you. Captain's waiting for you. Well, goodnight then. Taylor! You were killed. This whole section decompressed. Did you find a sealed compartment? Then how? You're dead, and I'm dreaming. I got as far as 'I regret to inform you.' You're not real. You don't have to call me sir. I wish it was that simple. I'd forgot about that. You will. You would have. Yes. The pounding your ships gave us didn't help much. Try it now. I'm going to reset the optical subprocessors. That might clear it up. When we slipped through your detection grid, we got a look at the weapon you're building. An impressive piece of engineering. Hell, it'd take at least a thousand starships like Enterprise to blow up an entire planet. You know, I'd like to see the telemetry from the probe you launched against Earth. I assume you were watching the attack, calculating the blast yields. Boy, you must have been pretty damn excited. I mean, that beam cut one hell of a swath through Florida. That's the name of one of the places you destroyed. Florida. Did you actually see the cities burning? The houses, the people being vaporised? I had a sister there. Just need a few more minutes, Captain. Aye, sir. It's one of the warp plasma conduits. We'll handle it. The flow regulators are damaged. There are manual cut-offs here and here, but we can only access it from outside. We don't have a choice. If we don't get control of it fast, it'll spread to the reactor. I could use a hand. Open that panel and I'll talk you through the cut-off sequence. Over there. I need to open the emergency bypass ports first, and you can't close your valve until I release the pressure from the secondary lines. Use your plasma torch. I'll be there in a minute. I'm releasing the interlocks on the first port. Careful you don't cut through the bypass relays, Malcolm. Understood. You okay, Malcolm? Get inside, Malcolm. I can wrap it up. I'm opening the primary bypass port. Two more to go and we're in business. Get inside, Malcolm. I can finish. A few more seconds. I'm purging the last port. Okay, Malcolm, clockwise ninety degrees. Nice work, Malcolm. Malcolm? Malcolm! Tucker to Doctor Phlox. Meet us in the airlock. What's one more dead human to you? He had no problem killing seven million of us, but seven million and one is more than you can stomach? I guess even Xindi have their limits. Aye, sir. Computer, begin recording. Dear Mister and Mrs. Taylor, I regret to inform you that your daughter was killed in the line of duty. She was a fine engineer, and she died performing her duties. Computer, stop recording. Delete that. Computer, start again. Dear Mister and Mrs. Taylor. As Jane's commanding officer, it's with deepest regret that I inform you of her death. She was a diligent engineer, very hard-working. Repair crews are starting tomorrow. Thought I'd try and get them some power. These assemblies are all fused together. I've spent the last hour trying to isolate the damaged relays. Courtesy of our new Xindi friends? Damn neighbourly of them. Not unless you can resurrect the dead. Crewman Taylor had a real knack for this kind of thing. But Taylor's not here, is she, and neither is Crewman Kamata, or Ensign Marcel or a dozen others. So forgive me if I don't want the damn power cells! We found Taylor over there, outside her quarters. She was probably trying to get to her station. If she'd made it a few more metres I wouldn't be trying to write this damn letter. 'Cause every time I start I hear myself saying, what a fine young woman she was, how smart and full of potential. And I realise that I'm not thinking about Taylor at all. I'm thinking about Elizabeth. There's so many people dead. I tried not to see her any differently than the other seven million, so I've spent the last nine months trying to pretend she was just another victim. But she's my sister, T'Pol. My baby sister. I envy you Vulcans. Computer, begin recording. Mister and Mrs. Taylor, by the time you get this, Starfleet will have already told you about Jane. Since I worked so closely with her, I wanted to add my personal condolences. I have to confess, I've been putting off writing this for a while. I convinced myself that my duties on Enterprise took precedence. But the truth is I didn't want to face the fact that someone so young, with so much promise, could just be gone. But I'm facing it now, and I find myself thinking how important she was to me. She was a great engineer, and she was my friend. She won't be forgotten. Goodbye, Elizabeth. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek Â® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Commander Tucker reassigned the repair team that was working here. He said the Armoury was a higher priority. We'll see how low a priority I am the next time he burns his fingers on a plasma conduit. You've experienced no further withdrawal symptoms? I'm only detecting trace amounts of trellium in your system. Hardly worth mentioning. That's good news. What is it? On Earth, there is a cautionary tale about the dangers of releasing a magical creature called a genie from the bottle. Once it's out, it's extremely difficult to put back in. You used trellium for three months. It caused significant damage to your neural pathways. You may have to learn to live with these emotions. On my way, Commander. Commander. So it seems. I understand you haven't slept since the attack. Perhaps she's worried about you. Has it occurred to you that we'll be far worse off if you collapse from exhaustion? I don't believe so. I'm relieving you of duty. You will go to your quarters and not return to your post before oh five hundred tomorrow. Please don't make me involve security. Yes, Captain. I'll be right there. Well, Commander? I believe the number was six. Four. Not a minute less. I'm aware of that. I believe our universe was toxic to him. His species evolved in a different dimension with a different set of physical laws. He simply couldn't exist here. I believe he was a test subject sent here to see if they were succeeding. Or any of us. We need to bring his body temperature down. Let's get him to Sickbay."

9265,ENT,episode 70,DEGRA,"We were told the Reptilians attempted to build a bioweapon. I see you found my message. We have a great deal to discuss and I don't have much time. Come aboard my ship. If we'd left you with the Reptilians they would have killed you. The Reptilians weren't very pleased about that either. If you're telling the truth, the future of my people is at stake. The precise date hasn't been determined yet. The weapon won't be launched for several days. Show us your proof and we'll do what we can to stop it. Damron. A colleague, of sorts. Reptilians felt a toxin would be more effective on your species. Damron and his team disappeared shortly after the Council rejected his proposal. This appears to be Xindi technology, but I'd like to have our engineers confirm it. What caused his death? Perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him. And if they are, you're saying the Expanse will no longer be compatible for us. There's also evidence of chronometric distortion. Time travel. You're determined not to trust him. And you've never wondered if she might have an agenda of her own? Captain Archer is expecting me. He claims to know a great deal about the Spheres. Perhaps my crew can help. I hope he'll be alright. Seventy eight, at our last count. We've had more time to study them than you. I never expected to meet anyone who'd suffered because of what I'd done. At the time, I thought the attack was necessary to save my people. That's right. Our escape from prison together. The reptilians are correct about one thing, Captain. You have an impressive facility for deception. Probably not. They are all connected by a subspace energy grid. Unfortunately our data on the Spheres' interiors is extremely limited. How did you get this? We've never been able to gain access to one. These scans are remarkably detailed for a military vessel. If we're successful, it will be again. We masked our warp trail. I don't know how they found us. Stand by. I said, stand by. You expect me to attack a reptilian warship? I did some work on their power systems. Their ship is heavily armoured. Those reptilians are Xindi. You're asking me to attack my own people. I want your word that my crew won't be punished. They would have contacted the Council and exposed our alliance. I had no choice. You need to speak to the Council. With the evidence you've shown me, they'll have no choice but to take us seriously. I'm more concerned about the aquatics. They can be somewhat enigmatic, but if we can sway them we'll have the majority on our side. These are the coordinates of the Council chamber. There's a shorter route, a subspace corridor. It's located in a nebula less than half a light year from here. That will show your helmsman how to get through it. I'll meet you at the far end in three days. I'll do everything I can to delay it. Use caution when you enter the nebula. A hostile species is known to prey on ships that approach it. Three days."

Perhaps you can demonstrate your ability to time travel? Very well. Such as? That's up to the Council. And this is the result of your finding them? But fortunately, you were able to stop him, by travelling back through time. This proves nothing. How do we know he didn't capture them in the present. This proves nothing except the reptilians disobeyed the Council, which comes as no great surprise. But you also claim that we've been misled by transdimensional aliens. Where is your evidence of that? We've met one of them. These tests only confirm the equipment belonged to the reptilians. The readings could have been fabricated. No more than you seem to be determined to believe whatever he says. Now, I admit Archer's evidence is intriguing, but we barely know this human. Our contact from the future has helped us many times. She brought this Council together. I am not a fool, Degra. All I'm saying is that it'll take a little more than a few chronometric distortions to turn the Council against her. More evidence? Degra, I know you've had doubts about building the weapon. Don't let them cloud your judgment. He's involved in sensitive negotiations. No one authorised the development of a bioweapon, but that didn't deter your colleagues from creating one. He intends to seize the human vessel. He'll destroy both our ships if we don't comply.

You can't think of anything. I served on Enterprise for three years. You pulled me off the Saratoga to be on your team. Captain Brody was pretty angry at you. You told me I'd make a fine Chief Engineer someday. Then tell my parents that. Tell them about the practical jokes Rostov used to play, or that one time when I found that glitch in the injector assembly that everyone else missed? Tell them how hard I worked.

According to Degra, they're not very tolerant of trespassers. How close are they to the corridor? We'll ionise the hull. That should mask our approach for awhile. Tactical alert. Take us in. Can you identify it? T'Pol? It's still under construction. Who are you? Come about, Ensign. Would you tell me what the hell is goingon? I'd like some answers first. How would you know that? Torpedoes, full spread. How long until we reach the corridor? Hold your course. Where are we? Degra? Are you sure we're at the right co-ordinates? Why didn't you, didn't we, go back through it? I'll notify the crew. Let Travis knowwe'll be getting underway. Even if we found a way out of the Expanse, we can't go back toEarth. We'd be contaminating our own culture, our own history. Maybe there's a way we can use this to our advantage. We know the date when Earth is attacked by the first Xindiprobe. We may be able to figure out a way to warn them, or even preventthe attack. You've been flying around the Expanse for over a century? To destroy the first Xindi probe. But you failed. You've made these modifications on your own ship? You've got to admit, it's a lot to accept. I'm not comfortable doing that just yet. Who's the father? Thanks. Starfleet will be glad to hear Enterprise was built tolast. Wasn't that boy Denobulan? You're not entirely human yourself. Was that? You know, finding your ship explains a few things. When theXindi took me prisoner they asked me one question over and over. Theywanted to know how many ships Starfleet had in the Expanse. I thought we were going to the Bridge. T'Pol. Living with humans for so long has changed you. They didn'ttell me you were still aboard. He's fine. If you'd like, I'll have him come by and say hello. There's so much I want to ask you. I don't know where to start. Have you shown that to Trip? We'll have to contact Degra, tell him we won't be able to makethe rendezvous. We'll be thrown back in time. How long will it take? You should have told me. My ship could bedestroyed. I'd call that a damn big risk. I've got two T'Pols who disagree with you. It's our best option. This is my mission and my decision. I didn't come over here for a debate. I've already given theorder. Trip's short-handed in Engineering. If you could spare a fewpeople he'd get the work done faster. Doctor? Whatever we can spare. You mentioned something about inoculations. Do what you can. I suppose when this mission is over, most of their crew willwant to return to Earth. We seem to be cut from the same cloth. I can imagine the look on the Admiral's face when he sees twoEnterprises pulling into Spacedock. Keep me updated. What's wrong? Archer to Engineering. Trip, respond. Send a security team. Hail them. Disable their engines. Stay with them. Get down to the transporter, and stand by. T'Pol? You heard her. T'Pol! Now lock onto their primary relays. They're on C deck, junction twelve. This is Captain Archer. Looks like we've got some thingsthat belong to each other. Why don't we call a truce and return ourrespective property. I know you've got your finger on the trigger. If you fire that torpedo, you'regoing to hurt a lot of people over here. Lorian, Answer me. You were lucky. Phlox says the injuries onboth ships were minor. You almost crippled us. My mission would havebeen over. Attacking your ancestors doesn't sound very logical to me. I'm sure your crew did everything they could to stop the probe. I could keep you locked up in here, but that wouldn't do eitherof us any good. All that matters is what we're going to do next. Whether you agree with it or not, I'm taking my ship into thatcorridor. And I'll stand a much better chance of completing thismission, our mission, if we work together. T'POL2 Take us in. Are the signatures being reflected? How long until we reach the corridor. Return fire. They don't seem to be having the same problem. Malcolm! Archer to Lorian. Now! Well done, Captain. Go ahead. Understood. Lorian, it looks like we're not going to be able to keep up with you. Thanks for the lift. We'll see you on the other side. Target their weapons. Where are we? Are we still in the right century? What about Lorian? One ship against four. Lorian has years of command experience. Something tells me weshouldn't write him off yet. I suppose there's another possibility. Since we weren't thrown into the past, maybe history somehow correcteditself. Go ahead. Put him up."

I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine. It would appear that his information is out of date. There areat least half a dozen ships. Within sixty thousand kilometres. A ship is dropping out of warp. This can't be right. It's Starfleet, NX class. We haven't entered the nebula yet. Eighteen seconds. We've travelled eleven point six light years. Nothing on long range sensors. Yes. What course should we set? Cochran's warp flight won't happen for another twenty six years. How? The probe won't be deployed for more than a hundred years. That's unlikely. Enterprise doesn't have fuel or provisions forsuch a long journey. I beg your pardon? You said we couldn't travel through the corridor. The hull wasn't designed for that speed. These chromosomes are human. That's impossible. Vulcans and humans have never been able toreproduce. Hello, Jonathan. It's good to see you. You mean, still alive. You look well. How's Trip? That might be awkward. I wish we had time to get reacquainted. You must give this to your Science Officer. She'll know what itmeans. She thinks that Lorian's plan won't work. T'Pol found a discrepancy in his calculations. If we exceed warp fivepoint six the injectors could start to overload. We'd be destroyed. He agrees with the assessment. There is an alternative. The subspace corridor. Not necessarily. T'Pol spent many years examining their sensorlogs from the incident. She believes it's possible to reconfigure ourimpulse manifolds. It should prevent the corridor from destabilising. About twelve hours. He had a right to know the risks. Why didn't you tell him? You're allowing your human side to get the better of you. I know that for them guilt can be a powerful motivator. Don'tlet it cloud your judgment. Not really. He's hardly a kid. He's more than a hundred years old. It's ridiculous to assume those events are going to happen. Handme the flux coupler. The fact that our counterparts married doesn't mean that we'lldo the same. I should have known this was a mistake. Exploring human sexuality with you. You're obviously unable tohave a physical relationship without developing an emotionalattachment. We would appear to be evenly matched. I can't establish a lock. We need to get closer. Acknowledged. I'm reading multiple images. We've lost aft plating. Hull integrity's failing. We've travelled eleven point six light years. It's unlikely they survived.

How the two ofus got together. Doesn't seem like we're talking about the same T'Pol. I just can't see myself married to her. I suppose if we weremarooned on a desert island. Have you spent any time talking to Lorian? You should. He seems like a good kid. Only in the Expanse could I have a son who's nearly three timesmy age. Who would have thought you and me, huh? Lorian says we're goingto be married in a traditional Vulcan ceremony. It's going to take meweeks to learn to pronounce the vows. You know where we're going tohave our honeymoon? Cargo bay three. He says I'll fill it up with sandthat we dug up from a passing asteroid. I'm even supposed to I'm even supposed to manufacture a palm tree. Aren't you at all curious about how you and I are supposed toend up together? You're afraid to admit that under the right circumstances youcould have feelings for me. Maybe you have them already. What? You know, all the other women on board must have been taken,because I can't imagine any other reason why I would have marriedsomeone as stubborn as you. I'll go help Rostov with the port manifold. You seem to have everything under control. I want those starboard modules recalibrated first. What the hell are you doing?

He'll be killed the moment he steps into the Council chamber. Do you believe Archer's being truthful? The humans could have manufactured this evidence. They'd doanything to save their planet. Reptilians patrol this side of the corridor. They'll destroythe human vessel as soon as it comes through. What makes you think the Reptilians won't fire on us?
9573,ENT,episode 71,DEGRA,"Perhaps my crew can help. These are the coordinates of the Council chamber. There's a shorter route. A subspace corridor. I'll meet you atthe far end in three days. Archer's ship was heavily damaged. They wouldn't stand a chanceagainst one of our cruisers. Those readings were never confirmed. Then we won't ask their permission. They have to listen. His allegations are too important to simplydismiss. If Archer is telling the truth, then all the Council's effortswill have been for nothing. I've already considered that. We can protect them. Captain, you're early. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

9645,ENT,episode 71,KARYN,"T'Pol eventually determined that ships can only travel throughthis corridor in one direction. You won't need to. We've encountered dozens of species. Some ofthem shared their propulsion technology with us. Perhaps we should go to Sickbay. Phlox can confirm our identity. We've doubled the efficiency of ouratmosphere processors. We can give you those specs too. Many of our crew are descendants of Phlox. He and Amanda hadnine children. My great grandmother was Ikaaran. Your wife. Her name was Esilia. You rescued her ship from ananomaly field. I'm sure they've picked us up on their sensors more than once. There's someone who'd like to see you first. But Degra's not expecting us. But the plan could work. Do you expect him to simply give them to us? You're going to steal them? Their warp drive will be disabled. You're asking me to betray Jonathan Archer. They're targeting our nacelles. I can't. They've knocked out the starboard power couplings. We're losing main power. We can't do this. These people are family. I'm not going to let you kill them. Captain, it's over. The aliens are regrouping. Four ships. The aliens are closing. Twelve thousandmetres, ten thousand. Direct hit. The pylons are starting tobuckle."
9646,ENT,episode 71,GREER,"How are we supposed to reach Degra? We can't sustain warp six,our injectors are too old. It's taking more time than we thought to reroute the plasma. Stand by. Greer to Lorian. The flow's been diverted. Sir, our weapons are losing power. Archer'susing the transporter. They've taken one of our manifolds. Hull plating's holding. Their aft plating's almost gone. They're targeting Archer's reactor. Forward launchers are gone."
9647,ENT,episode 71,LORIAN,"We couldn't stop it from entering the vortex. It's on it's wayto Earth. Everything is happening as it did before. Captain Archer, you must reverse courseimmediately. There's no time to explain. Alter your heading. Your weapons won't be necessary. I'm Lorian, Commander of Enterprise. Karyn Archer, my firstofficer. We should find a place to talk. Perhaps the Conference room? You'll want T'Pol to join us. You can't take your ship into the subspace corridor. If you do,you'll be thrown back in time a hundred and seventeen years. Because it's already happened. We're here to make certain thathistory doesn't repeat itself. The Kovaalans attacked Enterprise assoon as it entered the nebula. The trip through the corridor took only a few seconds, butit didn't take long before your crew realised something was wrong. Enterprise was in the right place But it wasover a hundred years early. We're not entirely sure why this happened,but we have a theory. We think your impulse wake destabilised thecorridor, causing it to shift in time. Your crew realised it would be their descendants Who'd have to complete this mission. Itwas only a matter of time before the first child was born. Enterprisebecame a generational ship. You showed your children how to operate andmaintain it's systems, and they did the same for their children. You've hardly changed, mother. You made alliances with other species, traded technology forfood and supplies. You even acquired a few alien crew members. We didour best to carry out the mission you gave us, Captain. We had years to prepare, but in the end we were only onestarship. Our weapons were no match for the Xindi. We couldn't stop thefirst attack, but we can help you stop the second. We can make certainyou reach the rendezvous with Degra this time. We got these schematics from Haridan traders. We can use themto modify your injector assembly. You'll be able to travel at warp sixpoint nine for brief intervals. We'll show you how to reinforce structural integrity. You'll beable to reach Degra in less than two days. Our plasma injectors are too old. They can't handle the stress. But your injectors are practically new. You're still not convinced. We don't have a lot of time. You need to start thesemodifications. I wasn't raised with the same inhibitions most Vulcans have. Myhuman side has allowed me to find a balance between emotion and logic. I've even been known to tell a joke on occasion. Would you hand me thecoil spanner? I learned almost everything I know by studying yourengineering logs. I'm sure you would have. You should reinitialise the start-uproutine before going to warp six. You died when I was fourteen. I'm not sure we should be discussing your future. You were a good father. It's strange being able to tell youthat. She never told me. Mother rarely talked about you. I think itwas too painful. She cared for you a great deal. Your relationship was somewhat contentious. But you were alwaysaffectionate towards each other. We should finish up with these injectors. There's only a twenty two percent chance of an overload. There's no alternative. You'll be thrown into the past if youtry to use the corridor. The Kovaalans will attack Enterprise the moment it enters thenebula. If they damage your manifolds, the corridor will destabiliseagain. You have to listen to me. Saving Earth is my mission as much as yours. You're the Captain. You shouldn't have spoken to Archer. If they use that corridor their mission will fail. Earth willbe destroyed. You know nothing about being human. Maybe you'd be a little more concerned if Vulcan was in danger,and not Earth. We'll meet with Degra. I'll speak to theXindi Council. Archer's following the same course of action he did before. He's not going to be at the rendezvous. We can't just sit here and hope he succeeds. Billions of livesare at stake. We're going to use the injectors from Archer's ship. No. My father's a resourceful engineer. He'll be able to fabricatenew injectors. I know this won't be easy, but we've had to make difficultchoices before. Our parents and grandparents lived and died aboard thisship to ensure that someday we would be able to stop the Xindi. This isour time. If Earth is going to survive, we have to act. Injectors are still online. Greer, how much longer? Hold your fire. Get back to the ship. Go. Archer gave me no other option. I'm sorry. Take us to warp. Get us out of here, full impulse. Return fire. Bring us in low, underneath them. Target their hull platingrelays. There's too much at stake. Stand down weapons. Tell Archer I want to talk. Your mission is over, Captain. You just won't accept it. I tookthe only logical course of action. You wouldn't understand. You can't. You don't know what it'slike living with the responsibility. Millions of people are deadbecause of me. I could have destroyed it. Years ago, I swore to my Captain onhis deathbed I'd save those seven million lives. You were the man Imade that promise to. I devoted my life to that mission. We knew theco-ordinates of the launch platform, the exact minute the weapon wasgoing to be deployed. But our plan didn't work. I had one last chance. Use Enterprise itself, set a collision course with the probe. But Ihesitated, my emotions took over. I couldn't give an order that wouldkill my crew. By the time I realised my mistake it was too late, theprobe was gone. I won't let my emotions get in the way again. I willnot let Earth be destroyed. They must have been surprised when yourreflection turned and attacked. Bring us a hundred metres off Archer's bow. Power the tractoremitters. Captain, tell your crew to brace themselves. What about Archer? See if we can get the alien's attention. Torpedoes. fullspread. Disengage the tractor beam. New course, one eight zero markzero. We'll keep them off your back. Yourmomentum will carry you into the corridor. We'll follow as soon as we can. Tell myparents that I'll see them soon. Reserve power to hull plating. Divert everything to the phase cannons. Continue firing."

9650,ENT,episode 72,ARCHER,"You know about the alien we found, the test subject? We'redestined to form an alliance to stop them. Whatkind of weapons do you have? We're hoping that'll include data on the Sphere Builders. I'm sending a crew in a shuttlepod. They'll join up with uslater. We're pretty sure we've found a way in. You've mentioned theXindi have been studying the Spheres for decades. We have the evidence to back it up. It's no wonder you had a hard time accepting this. I've stood before a Klingon tribunal. I can handle a toughroom. Go ahead. Anything you can tell me about them. I need to know what I'm upagainst. They're quick to take sides. We've run into them. From what I've seen that's not hard to believe. Don't worry. Keep my chair warm. How's your Insectoid these days? Is that all? I'll make sure I project. We're still two kilometres up. Avians. Kind of feels like being called to thePrincipal's office. I was once. When we're done here. You killed seven million of my people. I want to be honest withyou, I don't much like standing here. I know. You've been told that at some time in the future myworld is going to destroy yours. That's a lie. The Guardians built the Spheres. They're reconfiguring theExpanse, preparing it for colonisation. I am trying to save my world, but it's not just Earth that's indanger. If you wipe out mankind you'll be destroying yourself. Earth is going to lead a battle that defeats the SphereBuilders. They know this. That's why they manipulated you intoattacking us. Then we'll focus on the aquatics. What changed their minds? Your Council just might have the opposite effect. Come in. Degra, when I was on the future Enterprise four hundred yearsfrom now, there were Xindi aboard. Humans and Xindi were servingtogether in the Federation. That's a future worth fighting for. Passing notes. I got sent to the Principal's office for passing a note inclass. It was to Katy Bentley. I was inviting her to a party a friendof mine was throwing. Funny thing. She'd already turned me down, but after I got introuble. The Sphere Builders, the beings you call the Guardians, are thesame species. A few weeks ago we came across an alien. He was adrift in whatwe believe was a transdimensional disturbance. The alien was inside apod which was constructed of the same combination of alloys that makeup the outer shell of the Spheres. He was a Sphere Builder. Not all of it. Energise. He did. Tell me, is this one of the Guardians? Dismissed. We'll be in my Ready room. Who did this? Keep me appraised. Archer to the Bridge. Go to Tactical Alert. That hasn't stopped us in the past. Count on it. A lot can happen in a day. Archer. Report. Pursuit course. We're tracking it. We're right behind you. Stay with it. Keep firing. Tell them to stay put, and we'll come back for them when wecan. Open a channel to Degra's ship. We're moving in on the weapon. Hoshi!"

Picking up a very powerful energy signature. It's practically gift-wrapped. Can you pin-point it? I suggest we work fast. Reed to Shuttlepod one. Anything? I don't see anything. Are you sure? Hawkins! Go! Go! I'm all right. I'm fine. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe we'regetting a bit too comfortable with losing people. Twenty three men andwomen. On any given mission the limits of acceptable casualties istwenty percent. So says traditional military doctrine. Well, we'vecrossed that margin. That doesn't make his death any more acceptable.

Somewhat, but I'm still experiencing frequent Just a mild headache. I'm needed in the Command centre. The Spheres are controlled by a network ofartificial intelligence. This section houses the redundant memory core. It should contain a significant amount of information. Our present course will take us close to another Sphere. We're interested in any information you have on the constructionof their outer shells. Shut it down. Adjust heading oh two six mark three. Hold this position. The exhaust vent. Set a course, oh three one mark four. Half thrusters. Hold your course. Hold your course. Exactly. Proceed along this conduit. Sixty degrees starboard. Eighty degrees z axis. We shouldprepare for EVA. We're approaching the memory core. It's fifteen metres ahead. Reduce speed. Hold at half impulse. T'POL@ Lieutenant? There's a Vulcan axiom. The needs of the many outweigh the needsof the few. Corporal Hawkins understood that. No, but it makes it honourable. Most definitely."

We've been running double shifts in Engineering. Captain's inhell of a rush to get to this damned Council. Oh, I have faith in the Captain, but not in the people he'strying to convince. Reasonable? I don't think many people back in my home townwould go along with that. Thanks Doc. I'd breathe a whole lot easier if you hada couple of MACOs watching your back. Good luck. You need me for something? It's in the cargo bay. Lucky me. Do me a favour. Don't try to get on my good side. You got that right. This way. I still can't pin down the problem withthe converter. I think it's an energy drain somewhere. We're far fromone hundred percent. Question. Those portable power cells you left us. We're havinga little trouble getting them in synch. Think you can stick around fora few minutes, give us a hand? Listen, about all those things I've been saying. I just want totell you I know you went out on a limb. It's over here. It's weird. With things finally looking up you'd think I'dfinally be able to get some shut-eye. There's a section of the messhall up and running. In the mood for a snack? I guess you heard, the Captain pulled itoff. The Xindi postponed the weapon launch. Ever since the attack on Earth, all I've thought about isgetting back at whoever was responsible. I've gotten used to the anger. It's going to be like, I don'tknow, losing an old friend. Is it my imagination or are you losing weight? Yeah, I'm not the only one. Hoshi commented on it last week. What's your secret? Hold on, hold on. You have a worm inside you? How are you going to get it out? No, no, no, no, no. Never mind. I'm sure it is, Doc. I just don't want to lose my appetite. I can give you three point four with alittle coaxing, but some of the relays are still fried. We're in noshape for combat. You sure they're coming after us?

The Council is on the verge of tearingitself apart. We were all in the same room. You saw what happened. We are never going to convince the Reptilians or theInsectoids. Proceed. We have the three votes we need. Degra's dead. He was found in his quarters aboutan hour ago. He'd been murdered, stabbed. The Reptilians have called an emergency meetingof the Council. I believe their recent turnabout was nothing more thana ruse to keep us off guard. They're planning something, I'm certain ofit. Your ship's in danger. He was a member of this Council. You're going to regret a lot more than that. And you accuse Degra of being a traitor! Neither will we. The weapon cannot be launched without three of the codes. Youonly have two. The Reptilians and Insectoids haveseized control of the weapon. I've ordered all available ships to intercept. Concentrate your fire on the primarygenerators. Six metres below the aft thrusters."
9884,ENT,episode 72,DEGRA,"Theweapon won't be launched for several days. Show us your proof. You'resaying the Expanse will no longer be compatible for us. You need to speak to the Council. With the evidence you've shownme they'll have no choice but to take us seriously. Is it true your species built the Spheres? You expect me to attack a Reptilian warship? They would have contacted the Council andexposed our alliance. If Archer is telling the truth, then all the Council's effortswill be for nothing. That could help us with the Council. How do you plan to get inside it? I'll send over whatever's in my database. When it's finished compiling, send it toEnterprise. Dismissed. Dismissed! What do you want? I can't. I don't regret what I'm doing. Many of us have wondered that. No. How I'm remembered isn't for you to decide. You never deserved my faith. The Sphere Builders have lied to the Xindi. They've manipulated us for decades. I see that. Perhaps the arborealswill, and the others. The evidence may not be enough. The Sphere Builders saved theXindi from extinction. When our home world was destroyed they beganappearing to the survivors. They'd guide them to habitable planets,show them the location of valuable resources. They're practicallyworshipped. We call them the Guardians. I was brought up to revere them. I taught my own children togive thanks to them at the end of each day. That is what we're facing. The Klingons weren't determined to destroy your world. But theevidence is strong, perhaps it will be enough. We'll face the Counciltogether. I may take my seat at the Council table, but I'll be at yourside no matter what happens. Humanoids, arboreals and aquatics. They're with us. When wereach the Council's location we'll need their protection. Certain members have more influence thanothers. You know Jannar, the arboreal. He's fair-minded, a scientist,he'll listen to the facts. I count him as a friend. Unfortunately theother members are somewhat more complicated. The aquatics for instance. Kiaphet Amman'sor is a member of the Ibix dynasty, a very wealthy, verypowerful family. Her opinions carry considerable weight when shearrives at them. There's a saying. It's easier to count the stars inthe sky than it is for an aquatic to reach a decision. As for theinsectoids, well, their names grow longer the older they get, so theybecome a little difficult to pronounce. In many ways insectoids are theopposite of the aquatics. Which brings us to the reptilians, and Commander Dolim. There'sa story about him. I don't know if it's true, I'd like to believe itisn't. His daughter gave birth to a son. He had a deformity in hisright arm, not life-threatening but enough to preclude his ever joiningthe military. Commander Dolim had his own grandson poisoned. As I said, it may be just a story, but as a father it's alwaysin the back of my mind whenever I have dealings with him. This is Degra. We're escorting Enterprise to the Council. Power down your weapons And withdraw. Power down your weapons now. We're prepared to destroy your vessel ifnecessary. You're outnumbered and outgunned. There'sno need for this. I assure You the Earth ship poses no danger. I look forward to it. Aquatics respect boldness and confidence. They view hushed tones with suspicion. Not too loudly. The Insectoids interpret raised voices as a signof hostility. You should see it in a moment. The only way in is through the air. These cloud layers arepresent throughout the year. It's perfectly concealed. The sixth Xindi race. This was built centuries before theybecame extinct. According to our archaeologists it's over four thousandyears old. Move aside. I'm fully prepared to explain my actions. There's no cause forthreats. It's the truth. The data is accurate. Anyone with an objectiveeye will come to the same conclusion. My judgment is perfectly sound. You were trying to prevent us from reaching this Council. Any vessel that attacks Enterprise will be fired upon. Wait. We knew it wasn't going to be easy. The Aquatics weigh every argument in excruciating detail. For along time, they were against building the weapon. It showed mankind destroying our new homeworld. It was powerful evidence. Perhaps not. There might be a way to convince them. I'll requirethe services of your ship's Doctor. Yes, this will be very helpful. It was developed by the aquatics. They have an innate distrustof the spoken word. They respond more strongly to visual stimuli. The Captain would like you to assist me with the work. Your Captain thinks there's no one better to make thesemodifications. I agree. I understand you and I will always be enemies. I can't change what happened to your sister or any of the sevenmillion but I'm risking my life, I'm risking the lives of my family,I've killed members of my own species, all because I'm trying to saveboth our worlds. We've completed the work. Mister Tucker was extremelyco-operative. I know it isn't easy for him, working with me. What you're seeing is a biometric hologram. It's the sametechnology used to train our physicians. It was constructed frommedical data collected by Enterprise's medical doctor. Humans don't have the technology to produce a fabrication ofthis detail. There's been a development. The Reptilians have agreed to postpone the launch of the weapon. They'll need more convincing before they solidify their position, butthis is a significant step. That future you spoke of. Perhaps this iswhere it begins. Of course. If I had suffered your loss I'd feel the same way. Shall we getto work? Come in. I wasn't expecting you. I've always found it to be peaceful. Stench? I was surprised by your decision to postpone the launch. I hope the other members will come to the same conclusion. I agree. I'm assisting them with their engine repairs. What do you mean? I don't know what you're talking about. They left me no choice."

Timelines are sensitive. They're prone totemporary fluctuations. It's not too late. Not everyone has forgotten what we have done for your people. You've turned away from us. Come back. I hear it in your voice. You have betrayed everything youbelieve in and now you're in turmoil. At one time or another you must have asked yourself why we'veprotected the Xindi for so long. It's because we can see a future where the Xindi are no longerfragmented, no longer struggling for existence. You are destined tobecome a great civilisation, and now it's all in jeopardy because ofyou. You created a device that will prevent a devastating attack. Your name was to be spoken with reverence for generations to come, andinstead you have chosen the role of betrayer. What have we done to lose your faith? The Council is preparing to betray it'sown people. He has succeeded in raising doubts about us. The arboreals,humanoids and aquatics are considering what he had to say. He shouldnever have been allowed before the Council. And now they may decide against launching the weapon. For that to happen, three of the Xindi species must agree. Prove to them, or you? Persuasion is no longer a viable option. You must act with theinsectoids. Secure the weapon. A temporary schism cannot be avoided, but eventuallyReptilians will preside over a stronger unified Xindi empire. We willguarantee Reptilian dominance if humankind is eradicated."

That convinced the aquatics. The Avians. Once they darkened the skies of Xindus with theirnumbers. We formed the Council to prevent other Xindis from sharingtheir fate. After much deliberation we've agreed tolisten to this new evidence you wish to present. Your data states that this alien disintegrated when it cameinto contact with our universe. The physical resemblance is hard to deny. So are we. Please, continue. You admit killing him. Why did you call this meeting? That's not a choice, it's an ultimatum. None of us will.

How many Prisoners have you taken? For what purpose? What makes you think I would let you bring an enemy ship into asecurity zone? I don't take orders from you. What! You would fire on a Xindi vessel? Prepare to return fire! I'll see you in the Council chamber. You've brought humans into this Chamber,Degra. Explain yourself, if you expect them to leave here alive. You reek of desperation. You would say anything to save yourworld, as evidenced by this manufactured data. You have no idea what the truth is. Your sympathy for thesehumans has corrupted your judgment. Were you using sound judgment when you attacked my ship? I was protecting this Council! I refuse to listen to any more of this. Enough! I demand the immediate seizure of the Earth ship. You will not defy this Council. And we never will as long as we listen to this human's lies. Ifthis Council will not defend it's people then it has no reason toexist. Archer has achieved nothing. I couldn't prevent it. The weapon will be deployed. My Lieutenant simply wants to know that there's a way topersuade the Council. The weapon's well guarded. The casualties on both sides would beheavy. We'd be risking civil war. Understood. If you ever question the Guardians again your skin will adornthe bow of this ship. Have you manufactured more data to support this claim? We are open to hearing more. There are some things we need to discuss. I've never liked this place. It's too exposed. Reptilians prefer to be near the ground. Andthen there's the stench. Of failure. Of a race that failed to survive. It seemed like the right thing to do. They'll fall into line. I have always believed that all Xindilong for unification. It's in our blood. The Earth ship. They've found quite an ally in you. A pity you haven't extendedthe same friendship to your fellow Xindi. We recovered a sensor encoder from our missing scout ship. Itwas in the cloaking barrier of a Sphere. We were able to extract thefinal scans it took before they were destroyed by you. The evidence is irrefutable. We have an image of your shipfiring. Don't try to deny what you did. And you've left me no choice. The crew of that ship are the last Xindi you'll ever betray. When the humans have been eliminated, when the Council has beenreplaced by reptilian rule, I am going to find your wife and childrenand do the same to them. Your traitorous bloodline will end at the tipof my blade. With pride. He was a traitor. Degra destroyed a Reptilian ship. Twenty two crewmen died. Ionly regret not doing it sooner. You have a decision to make. We've taken control of the weapon. We're going to launch it. Either you stand with us, or you stand against us. Call it what you will. Then we withdraw from this Council. It's lasted too long. You've become complacent. Do you really believe we haven't considered that? Forget the others. Target Enterprise. Get the female. The female? Take us into the vortex."

For all you know they could be heading to Earth. What about the Aquatics? They've abducted my Communications Officer. Up until now Ididn't know why. She'll never co-operate. Any luck? Integral how? If we can damage one of them, would it disrupt the entire grid? Keep at it. How quickly can we get there? You have nearly as many ships. Would the Aquatics be a match for them? That was before the reptilians murdered Degra and stole theweapon. We're looking at civil war. Can they afford to sit back and donothing? Let me talk to them. I didn't quite catch that last part. How long do they plan to keep us waiting. You all right? Thank you for seeing me. I'm afraid my Communications Officerwas abducted by the Reptilians. Then I'll get to the point. We need your help. 2 And if my world gets torn to rubble in the meantime? I believe they took my officer to help them decipher a thirdlaunch code. After all your deliberations, you may find a decision'sbeen made without you. AQUATIC2 So you'd rather sit back and do nothing While they condemn all five of your species to extinction. AQUATIC2 One last question. Have these Guardians told you where you'llestablish your new home world? The ones humans are destined to destroy? Is it here, in the Expanse? In case you haven't noticed, the Spheresare turning it into a transdimensional wasteland. None of you will beable to survive. You say the Guardians have helped you. Have they ever tried todisable the Spheres? Because we've found a way. Help me save my people and I can help you save yours. What they use to connect the Spheres. Well done. Then you'd better keep at it. If the aquatics decide to help usthey might want to hear those details. Please do. Any word? I'm surprised you were ever able to get anything done. That's actually something I wanted to discuss with you. Ifwe're successful, and we destroy the weapon Report. Open a channel to the lead ship. AQUATIC2 And? Thank you. When this is all over, I won't be complaining about the food. I'll just be happy to get back to our original mission. I wouldn't miss it. The High Command would be lucky to get you back. I may be able to pull some strings, get you out of basictraining. Go ahead. Tactical Alert. I'm on my way. Feel like taking them on? This is Captain Archer. Cut us loose. Steady, Travis. Fire. Bring us around for another pass. Can you get a transporter lock? Send Major Hayes and his team. Keep us clear of them, Travis. Do what you can, but keep us in firing range. Go ahead. Go ahead. Archer to Tucker. Lock onto Major Hayes. Archer to Hayes. We've got a malfunction. Can you hold your position? Get us close, Travis. I said, take us in. How long before it reaches Earth? Could an aquatic ship reach it in time? We might be able to get a team on board, disable it from theinside. We'll deal with them when we get there. Are you ready? Then as soon as we undock, set a course for Sphere Forty One. How is she? I need to talk to her. She's been inside the weapon. I have to know what she saw. All right. Have her taken aboard Degra's ship right away. I don't have any choice, Doctor. I want her on that ship in twenty minutes. There's a medical bay aboard Degra's ship. Show Lieutenant Reedhow to do it. Phlox, you're needed here. When we're finished, we'll meet you at the rendezvouscoordinates. I expect you to keep him in line."

First, I'd like to know if we have a problem. If you blame me for the Corporal's death. I did everything I could. Things happened very fast. I'm not finished. Hawkins may well have been a MACO, but he wasmy responsibility out there. If I contributed to that, I apologise. Bridge to the Captain. We're approaching the co-ordinates. They're moving to intercept, but they'rekeeping a substantial force around the weapon. Give me the word, sir. We're in range. Minor damage to the starboard nacelle. We'restill in the fight. Aye, sir. They're preparing to launch. They're gone. Doctor? I'm afraid he's a bit of a mother hen. Thank you for bringing her home. What? No more of that talk. That's an order. At ease. I've just comefrom Sickbay, where the Doctor assures me that Sergeant Kemper andEnsign Sato will make full recoveries. Unfortunately, Major Hayes'injuries were more severe. He didn't survive. I'm sorry. We've got lessthan ten hours before this weapon reaches Earth. The Captain wants totake a team aboard to destroy it. I don't imagine the reptilians willmake this easy for us, but that's why you're here. That's why MajorHayes picked each one of you for this mission. Because he knew you'dget the job done.

It shouldcontain a significant amount of information. We need to access the data from this. Meet me in theCommand centre in half an hour. I'll assist you. This could be a command subroutine. We'll have to make do without her. We're here to analyse this data, not speculate on Ensign Sato'sfate. I'm fond of Hoshi as well, but we can't allow her situation tobecome a distraction. There's a great deal of data to analyse, but we've made someprogress. We know the Spheres are connected by a subspace energy grid,but four of them appear to be integral to that connection. I believe they act as control Spheres, allowing the network tooperate in concert. A deflector pulse might disrupt thesubspace links. We could tie the impulse reactors directly into the array. The Captain told the aquatics we could disable these Spheres. Really. You've dismissed all of my proposals. Or you might surprise me with an idea of your own. Commander, Trip! Everything that's happened recently has causedme to become slightly emotional. I apologise. I wish I could. It may take some time before I regain mycontrol. It will be difficult to do, especially on my own. This appears to be some kind ofinterspatial manifold on the surface of Sphere Forty One. We'll keep working. I've heard no complaints, except from Chef of course. You may buy me a drink if you wish. There are some colleagues I'd enjoy seeing again, but I'veconsidered formalising my service with Starfleet. I said I was considering it. Captain, I've located Ensign Sato. She's onboard one of the Reptilian vessels. She's somewhere on the first three decks. I can't pinpoint herexact location. Captain, there's a massive anomaly formingnear the weapon. Two more. Captain. The power readings from the weaponare increasing. I believe so. We have a plan to disable Sphere Forty One.

I hope you didn't make them any promises. I'd almost forgotten what Chef can do with a steak. I hope thecrew forgives me for not patching up the Galley sooner. When this is all over, I plan on having a little chat with theStarfleet Quartermaster about what they put in those ration packs. Hope you plan on swinging by Earth first.

It's been a longtime since you've been to Vulcan. Can you imagine the look of Soval's face when he sees her in aStarfleet uniform? Please let me be there. I wish I could, sir.

10201,ENT,episode 73,HUMANOID,"Theweapon cannot be launched without three of the codes. We're trying to determine their location. It's difficult totrack them inside a vortex. Each of the five species has a set of commands to initiatethe arming sequence. Three of them are needed to activate the weapon. Their actions aren't easy to predict, but so far they seemdetermined not to take sides. And that will take time. She may not have a choice. They're less than four light years from here. They're attempting to arm the weapon. The propulsion systemhas to be offline to do it. You may have noticed that Reptilians and Insectoids are morebelligerent than we are. Their ships are armed accordingly. Their ships are extremely powerful, but they've seen yourevidence. They're not convinced. Now isn't thetime to dissolve the Council. So we should leave our fate in the hands of the Reptiliansand the Insectoids? I disagree. The evidence the humans provided can't beignored. They have agreed to meet with us, but don't expect much,Captain. You have to deal with the Aquatics on their terms. They're here. That may not be true. It's only been three hours. The Council once needed toresolve a simple logistical matter. It took the Aquatics six days toagree to attend the meeting. On the contrary. Their prudence was usually the only thingthat kept the Council from dissolving into chaos. That's why Degra hadthem build the weapon. He didn't want the reptilians and insectoids tohave too much control. What's to prevent us from building another one? I knew Degrafor many years. He could be difficult, uncompromising. We argued often. For instance, when he insisted that we meet with you. But when Degraspoke only a fool would ignore him. He believed there was a futurebetween your people and ours. When this is over, I intend to see if hewas right. That was remarkably fast. Have all ships concentrate their fire on the weapon. Captain Archer. The anomalies are creating a barrier between us and theweapon. We can't get through. Doubtful. They have powerful weapons but their speed islimited. The ship isn't well-armed. It would be useless against theweapon. Captain, the Aquatics joined us only because you promised toneutralise the Spheres. They expect you to fulfil that promise."

We try this and theship's going to come apart at the seams. The Captain told the Xindi we'd try to knock these things out. He didn't say anything about demolishing Enterprise in the process. Every day. I think I've found a way to boost the deflector pulse withouttearing the ship apart, but it's going to mean transferring all impulsepower to the array. As soon as we reach the Sphere. Sorry, Travis. You're going to have to get us to the manifoldon thrusters only. You can do it. Look over these schematics, familiarise yourselfwith the features of the Sphere. Standing by. Doc, there's something weird happening to my skin. Got it. Fish in a barrel. What the hell's going on? Power just fell ten percent. I'm losing the beam. You've got to stop this. If I don't get full power back this isgoing to take three, four minutes longer than we've got. It's coming back. Tell them to keep doingwhat they're doing. No pressure. What's going on? Wait a minute, I'm almost there. Give me ten seconds. I'm telling you I've got it. It sure is. None of them? What about the thermobaric cloud barrier? Looks like we kept our end of the bargain. We should have heard something by now. What if they failed? Earth could be My skin's healing faster than yours. I guess you Vulcans aren'tso tough after all. I'm only kidding. You look nice like this. Kind of like an oldoil painting. I can't believe you told me that. That's not what I mean. I've been trying to get you to tell meyour age since we left Spacedock. Why now? Intimate? Captain, did you stop the weapon? Captain? Where is he? Is he okay? What do you mean, he didn't make it. Mind if we take a look? Prettiest sight I ever saw. It's all in one piece. What? Then why the hell doesn't anyone want to talk to us? Land atthe pad behind the Command Centre. It's about time. This is Commander Charles Tucker of theStarship Enterprise.

They obviously expected us. If the ship were to enter that disturbance, the entire crewwould be dead within minutes. I could synthesise a neuraleptic compoundthat would keep us conscious for approximately twelve minutes. I'mafraid there's nothing I can do to prevent epidermal decay. Perhaps I can extend it, but not by much. I encourage you andMister Tucker to encourage alternatives. There must be something youcan do to abbreviate your plan. And if it's not toomuch of an inconvenience, I'd appreciate it if you'd contact my firstwife's third husband, Groznik. Tell him that he's welcome to keep theAldebaran drum set I loaned him. Oh, they have a child named Indaura, asweet little girl, she must be eight or nine by now. Well, I would liketo leave her my botanical library. She always had a flair for plants. Computer, pause recording. Everything's ready here. Oh no, don't be silly. I was simply dictating a letter to mycolleague, Doctor Lucas. He offered to make sure my affairs were inorder in the event that, er, well, you know. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. I don't know aboutVulcans, but Denobulans take great pleasure in bequeathing theirbelongings to far-flung relatives. I've enhanced the neuraleptic compound asmuch as I can. I strongly advise we remain in the disturbance no longerthan fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes and counting. Thirteen minutes left. It was expected. Try not to scratch it. Eleven minutesremaining. Less than ten minutes to go. There are nine alien lifesigns aboard. They appear to betransdimensional beings. This disturbance we're in, it's obviously been altered enough tosustain them. We can't afford three or four minutes. Corporal Kelly, listen tome very closely. Modulate your weapons to a rotating frequency ofthirty two point six teracycles. Our transdimensional friend, the one we found in the pod, I hadquite a few hours to study his physiology. Let's hope my memory servesme well. It's time for you to work your magic, Mister Tucker. Within fiveminutes, everyone on this ship is going to start dying. Ignore it Commander. You've got less than two minutes. T'Pol. T'Pol! You don't have a minute, Commander! That's it, times up. Without the Spheres, their transformed space must be collapsingin on itself. It's all right. Allright, it won't be much longer. I promise. I think they sense that we're travelling in an unusual manner. In the belly of the beast, so to speak. I don't have the slightest idea. I doubt I'll get much peace andquiet around here until we're flying under our own power. Is there something I can do for you? Oh, you're doing fine. Vulcan's are obviously more sensitive tothe effects of mysterious realms. Excuse me? Only time. How's morale? I suppose we'll all need time to heal. After a while.

I've found the sequence, but decrypting it's another story. Yourfriend Degra didn't make this easy. The first time you came to visit me in Brazil. I had a bug then, too. A tropical bacterium not a reptilianparasite. I was sick as a dog but I wanted to make a good impression. Or reptiles. Start with the third one from the left. The second from the right.

We've gotten close enough to isolate theirsignatures. We have no idea. All we know is that the weapon is beingescorted by a single Reptilian vessel. Dolim's. They're eight hundred thousand kilometres ahead. A military installation? They're heading back towards the weapon. They're arming their torpedoes. There's another vessel approaching at high warp.

All I can tell you is we're on the same side. I didn't cut and run. Where is your husband now? It's not bad. Billie Holiday. Alicia, I'm going to ask you something. It's going to sound alittle strange. When I was in a German medical tent, one of the soldiers whocame in to see me wasn't like the other ones. He had grey skin, redeyes. He wasn't human. This isn't the first time you've heard somethinglike this. They may be more than stories. I need to track down thissoldier I saw. It's very important. Would you contact Sal? Just tell Sal I want to talk to him. Makes the Germans feel like heroes. Fighting to feed the people. Look. Why not? You could say that. I'll keep that in mind. What's he look like? I want to talk to him. No thanks. I got a pretty good idea. I hadn't considered it. Rat. Orson Welles. War of the Worlds. My engineer played it forme once. A friend at a radio station made a recording. I'm sure you would have given them a run for their money. Who are you? Answer me. Why are you changing history? You're helping the Germans winthe war. Why? Sal, no! Damn it! Not like that. I don't know how long I can hold them off. You better talk tome. Now, who are you? What are you doing here? You said I was a temporal agent. My ship. I need to contact them. Can I do it with this? The conduit. Where's it being built? Archer to Enterprise. That was an extraterrestrial. I don't know what planet he was from. Upstate New York. Enterprise, come in. Enterprise. Enterprise! Captain Archer to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, comein. T'Pol. Two to transport. It'll have to wait. You're all right. You're on my ship. It's kind of complicated. I promise. We're not quite home yet, but it's good to be back. I guess Ihave some catching up to do. Status? Keep searching. This is one of the aliens' communicators. Takeit apart. Figure out how to monitor their transmissions. I hope it's the last time you'll have to look after Porthos. Is he awake? Who are they? Stay with me. Stay with me.

I've been going over those military dispatches that Hoshi pickedup. Some of them don't make sense. They mention recent battles inVirginia and Ohio. There weren't any battles fought there in World WarII. The Nazis never got to North America. Something's very wrong downthere. I'm picking up one life sign aboard. It's Suliban. He disabled the transponder. However, we are picking up traceplasma signatures, probably from the damage. I think I can get uswithin three kilometres of where it went down.

It's been some time since Iwas there. I think he'd be hard-pressed to find any positive aspects. Buthe would try, nevertheless. Come in. Do you have any theories as to what caused this? Will he survive? He very well could be responsible for our being here. He couldalso be the only hope of getting back to our own time. It is imperativethat I speak with him. For what purpose? Daniels. The events of this period don't correspond withrecorded history. Germany has launched a successful invasion of theUnited States. How do we return to our century? Stop who? Daniels. Stop who? Hail them. Phase-cannons. Before he lost consciousness, Daniels toldme there was someone we had to stop. Can you get a fix on the shuttlepod? That will have to suffice. T'Pol. What's the shuttlepod's condition? Commander. We will. One problem at a time. The explosion may have disrupted their comm. signal. Let's hear it. Captain? Your transmission is very weak.

We can't keep diverting vital materials from war production! That could change, very quickly. Intelligence suggests theAmericans are preparing a counterattack. Our front lines are dangerously thin, supply routes are under constantattack from resistance fighters. A forceful enemy thrust could stand a good chance of breaking through. On top of this, there've been setbacks in Africa, and the Russians areattempting to retake Moscow. Though no one has expressed this to the Fuhrer, there is widespreadbelief that Germany has advancedtoo far, too quickly. You make promises. All we ever see are films!

I won't tell anyone. Shut up! You got three seconds. One, two, three. Damn military. You cut and run, you leave us at the mercy of theseNazi bastards. Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot. It was an orderly retreat. Vic might break. If he talks, it won't be safehere. Alicia. We're going to see if we can find out any more information aboutVic. Curfew starts in an hour. We got to move fast. I know what you mean. We used to own this neighbourhood. Nothing to tell. We were delegates for the Construction WorkersUnion. Come on, let's go. This guy's a welsher and a drunk. I wouldn'tput too much stock into what comes out of his mouth. I'm only doing this because Alicia asked. Don't forget that. I want you to tell him what you told me, about your customer. What you owe me, take twenty percent off. What? I'm a generous guy. Hey, You think the Germans are tough? Get me in a bad mood. Could be the lastCuban in the city. You don't know what you're missing. I read in a magazine once the Germans were doing medicalexperiments on people. Well, maybe that's what you saw, one of theirexperiments. A lot of weird stories floating around. The Germans working on newweapons, guns that shoot light instead of bullets. Turn people intodust. It all sounds like one of those stories that guy, Orson Welles,dreamed up. How'd he do that? You know all those people who panicked? I was one of them. I fellfor the whole thing. I called my sister in Jersey, I told her theMartians were coming. She broker her ankle racing for the car. It costme a fortune in medical bills. Sometimes I wish the Martians had come. We're keeping the Germans busy, more and more ofus every day. Irish gangs, dockworkers, coloureds, even broads. Some ofthese women, they can shoot the fleas off a tick. When the war's over,I got half a mind to put them on the payroll. Here. It's loaded. Prazki? You'd better take her advice. You ever see anything like that before? That's no mask. What in the hell is a temporal agent? Listen, you freak. How does this suit you? It's better than he deserves. You want answers, don't you? The hell with it. We better get out of here. Was that my imagination, or did he say something about being fromthe future? You want any more of our help, you're gonna tell us what's goingon. What was that back there? A Martian? Well, where are you from? We gotta get out of here. Move."

It's from the future. Double the security details at all the entrances to the compound. If they have located us, it won't be long before they strike. If the prisoner hadn't escaped, we might know the answer to thatquestion. You know what I expect of you. The weapon fires a modulating plasma pulse equivalent to theenergy produced by three eighty eight millimetre shells. Each pulse can destroy a tank. I can't give you a specific timetable. There are still someproblems to be addressed. Portability. The weapons require considerable power. In mycentury, there are energy cells the size of a coin. In this century,it's somewhat more difficult. Requisition forms. I require additional supplies. We are inside the home of a former American President. It seemsto me your war effort is going well enough. All the more reason to accede to my request. The weapons I'mpreparing will make you immunefrom any counterattack, anywhere in the world, and I'm not justreferring to plasma rifles. Imagine a plague targeting non-Aryans. No need for extermination camps. Just a few grams of a pathogenintroduced into the water supply. There's far too much at stake for us to argue. We have far toomuch in common. We both embrace the ideals of purity and perfection, and we both faceenemies that would destroy us. Now is not the time to end an association that is vital to our mutualsurvival. Then I'll expect delivery by the end of the week. We're picking up scans from a ship in orbit. It's from the sametime period as the device we foundon the escaped prisoner. This resistance member you're interrogating. Bring him to me. You won't stop us. When we get back, you'll never have existed. Leave your weapons on the ground and stand up slowly.

We lostfour men in the assault. We were in the midst of a crucial weapons test. He was just anAmerican prisoner. A temporal agent? How could they have possibly found us? The prisoner will be recovered. We're conducting extensive sweeps within a fifteen mile radiusof the ambush. We haven't found the prisoner, but we have taken inseveral members of the resistance. They're being interrogated. There'sone that I suspect took part in the ambush. Yes? You. What do you want? I have nothing to say to you. You're not what I expected. Temporal agents are usually moreinformed. You wouldn't understand. Because it suits us. We're trapped. The Germans are helping us construct a conduitso we can find our way home.

You're my first bona fide POW. I usually fix up guys in theresistance. Easy. Easy, easy, easy, sailor. You don't want to start bleeding again. That patch on your shirt says Enterprise. You must have made itoff before it sank. How'd you wind up all the way over here? It's 1944. I haven't heard it called that before, but that's as good adescription as any. Used to be a pretty nice neighbourhood, even for coloureds. As you cansee, it's gone downhill. We in Brooklyn. New York City? When? Sal! We've been through this. This is my home. I'm not leaving. Not bad. He's in the Pacific, on a destroyer. I hear the war isn't goingany better over there. Don't be expecting a second course. You're a rotten liar. All the good stuff goes to the Germans. Istill can't believe it. You know, that they're actually here. I'llnever forget the day I saw that first German tank rolling up Flatbush. All the people streaming across the Brooklyn Bridge, trying to get outof Manhattan. The President on the radio, vowing to persevere, rightbefore the government evacuated Washington. Right ontime. Good to know there's something that your remember. Germans outlawed coloured music. Some of the neighbours pass aphonograph from house to house every night, so the Germans can't findit. Just another way of telling 'em off. What else is new? Sal mentioned some stories once, but I didn't believe them. I don't know. Thanks, Carmine. Used to be we'd get meat on Wednesdays and Fridays. Then it wasjust Wednesdays. Nazis blame theresistance, say we're disrupting the food shipment. Yeah. No eye contact. We don't want any trouble. Like I said, neighbourhood's gone downhill. Yeah, sometimes the Germans don't wait for curfew. Yeah, tell him what you guys did before the war. Right. The loan-sharkinq was just a part-time job. When they didn't pay you back on time. That's where the crimepart came in. Sal. Throw the gun down. Come on. Come on! His blood wasn't even red. Fellas. A lot of people out past curfew. What are you doing?

Twenty six. In a battle with a hostile species. On Earth, between human beings, war has been eliminated. Butthe galaxy's a big place, with thousands of species. Not all of them have the same values we have. I can send you anywhere in the world. To a place that isn'toccupied by the Germans. I had a feeling. Two of my men are missing. They could behiding out,they might've been taken prisoner. They could be dead. I know. We're going to stop them. That's one of the reasons we're here. But we're going to do it another way. Shuttlepods are damaged. The transporter is all we have. I'm going to have to break that promise. Who took his place? Hitler was able to concentrate on the West. Then they couldn't have been responsible for the changes thattook place in 1916. Chicken or the egg. Go ahead. This is Captain Archer. What do you want? Are they all right? We can bring you aboard. That's not what I'd consider neutral. A few hours ago, you tried to kill me. Where are my men? Are you all right? Get back to the ship. Trip. Beam them up. How? Go on. We had a little help. I know that you're trapped here, and that you're trying to getback to the twenty ninth century. I also know you've made a deal withthe Germans. They're giving you supplies, helping you build a timemachine. If you carry out your mission, if you make it back to thetwenty ninth century, you will ignite a war that will devastate thetimeline. So do you. Who decides what improvements are needed? And what's that? History's been changed. The century I left will be completelydifferent. How are they doing? He thinks we're considering it. What'd you see down there? Daniels sent us here to stop them from completing it. Problemis, it's protected by some kind of energy shield. Where's my Engineer? Silik. This disk youwere carrying. It contains schematics of Vosk's facility. This is whatyou came here for, isn't it? I'll try answering them myself,then. Your benefactor wants to do more than just project his image intothe past. He wants the technology to travel into the past. Somehow, hefound out that Daniels was sending Enterprise here, so you were orderedto hitch a ride. Your mission was to break into Vosk's compound andsteal this. Maybe that's why you came back aboard. Maybe you needEnterprise. I'm glad you're not disappointed. Of course not. I think you left himsomewhere inside Vosk's compound. And for your sake, he'd better bealive. And not at all for the better. He's Suliban. He's aboard my ship. He's a stowaway. I can't allow that. I reserve that right. And I have phase-cannons aimed at your facility. The answer is no. Return fire. Travis. Get to work on repairs. Keep looking over thoseschematics. Find a way to disable the shields protecting that compound. I'm getting my crewman back. You're goingto help me get inside the facility. Yes. We'll work around it. When the shields are down, give us ten minutes, then destroythe facility. Do what you can. Move in close, and fire point-blank if youhave to. We've come a long way in ashort time. Speaking of Vosk, seems to me that you both have a commonenemy, Daniels. Why hadn't you decided to work together? He's found some partners here. Sounds like you and Vosk have some history. Then how is it that you're here? Are you saying you owe Daniels' people your lives? I'm looking for Alicia Travers. My name's Archer. They're building weapons there. Extremely powerful weapons. All right. We're in. We're making our way to the console. Understood. Not yet. It's second on my list, believeme. I hadn't noticed. Sorry, only one to go around. Silik. Archer to Enterprise. Archer to Enterprise. We'll get you out of here. Trip. It's me. If you do,you'll probably regret it. Good to see you, Commander. As long as you don't pull that trigger. The building's about to blow up. This way. You got to pull your people out. In a few seconds, this entire area is going to be bombed. I can't argue with that. I'll try. Thank you. Photonic torpedoes. Malcolm. Take it out. And you're here to give me a pat on the back. Well, I don't want it. I want you to leave me and my crewalone. We're done with you and your damn Temporal Cold War. I'll take your word for it. Just send us home. Everyone all right? We're in the right place. Let's find out if we're in the righttime. Hoshi? Do they look friendly?

Russia didn't become Communist, and Germany never considered it athreat. After France, Belgium and the Netherlands fell. Hitler quicklytook England and then the eastern United States. The police never captured Lenin's assassin. Some bystandersclaimed that the killer vanished into thin air. But I thought we were here to prevent Vosk from starting thetemporal war. Engines took a serious hit. Weapons are down. There's heavy bombing. Most of it in eastern Pennsylvania andsouthern Virginia. It could be an Allied attack. The closest fighting is a hundred kilometres south of New YorkCity. Incredible. Engines are at thirty six percent. Manoeuvring thrusters areoffline. The targeting array's fried. We'll be shooting in the dark. He did it. One hundred kilometres. Targeting scanner still can't get a lock. I'm going to have to do this the old-fashioned way. Switching to visualscanners. Nicky, cover them. German dive-bombers. Stukas. Nothing too muchto worry about. However, they were fitted with sirens to frighten theenemy during an attack.

10948,ENT,episode 76,T'POL,But Vosk and his men arrived on Earth recently. A few years ago. Daniels said that different factions in the Temporal War arechanging history throughout the timeline. Maybe this assassin wasworking for one of them. Their shields are still holding. You should be able to deactivate theshields from this console. Here's the procedure. The data from the diskwas extremely helpful. Our targeting array is offline. We're in need of CommanderTucker's skills. Understood. Good luck. Could it pose a danger to the Captain? What's our repair status? Weapons? Our targeting array is still down. We're going to have to drop out of orbit toget close enough. Have you located Commander Tucker? Take us in. Distance? Slow us down. Two hundred kph. A group of aircraft are taking off from the base north ofManhattan. They're headed towards us. Mister Reed. It appears that bullets and sirens aren't all they have. I'm reading a powerful energy surge insidethe facility. I'm picking up vessels approaching. Dozens of them.
10949,ENT,episode 76,TUCKER,"We just pulled three fifty calibre bullets fromthe shuttlepodhull. We are two hundred years in the past. Captain! I don't believe it. How can you be We weren't exactly treated like royalty. We're okay. Wait a minute. You're coming with us. What happened after we beamed up? You make some kind of deal? Are we? We were in some huge building, like a factory. They'reconstructing something big. The Germans are helping him. Hold it right there. Shut up. Drop the disguise, Silik, or I'll blow your ugly headoff. Captain? You're alive? I can't believe it. Gotcha."
10950,ENT,episode 76,SILIK,"You persist in asking questions you know I will not answer. Tell me, how was I planning to send that to the future? An impressive display, Captain. Though I'm not implying you're correct in any of yourassumptions. But you don't have the answer you're seeking. The whereabouts ofyour missing crewman. You've changed, Captain. And then? Are you going to destroy it? I don't care about your crewman, Captain, but I don't want Voskto succeed any more than you do. I'll help you. There is one problem. Iuse my genetic enhancements to get inside the building. Your presencewill negate that advantage. You're welcome. How do I look? Better? From my dealings with you and your crew, I'd come to believethat your race was inherently unaggressive. One thing is clear. When necessary, humans are fully capable ofreverting to old methods. The way you handled that Xindi threat wasextremely effective. No doubt it's the reason why Daniels chose you tostop Vosk. One doesn't join forces with Vosk. They're only a means to an end. To him and his followers, otherspecies exist only to serve their needs. His faction once tried to eradicate the Suliban. They travelledinto our past, altered it to prevent our species from attainingsentience. He was stopped by the Temporal Agents. They still oppose us, they're still our enemy. That will neverchange. Do we really need these people? I don't see how they can be of any use to us. Are you threatening me? Why would you do that? It only opens from the inside. Take cover. They're activating the conduit. Work fast, Captain. We're in an extremely precarious position. It might help if I had a weapon. They're in the atmosphere. Ionisation. The signal can't penetrate. I think not. You've proven a worthy opponent, Captain. Iwould've preferred to die fighting you, but I suppose I can settle forthis."

Theweapons I'm preparing will make you immune from anycounterattack anywhere in the world. I assume you're taking the necessary steps. What is that? You've been spying on us. I suppose I would've done the same. Tell your Fuhrer he'llreceive the squadron when I deem it ready for deployment. With all due respect, your intelligence is flawed. And I am tired of your threats. We take that oath seriously. You've made certain promises to me as well. General, you might consider what would happen if my weapons wereto fall into the hands of the Allies. Imagine Berlin obliterated byplasma cannons. You are a fool. You think we're equals because I allow you toparticipate in this struggle. You fight to control nations. We dominateentire worlds. We extend our will across time. If your race were toendure for a million years, you couldn't begin to approach what we'veaccomplished. The next time you feel the urge to threaten me, rememberthis Begin the test sequence. I've arrived at the same conclusion. Their technology suggeststhey're from a period too early for time travel. Still, I refuse to believe their presence here is an accident. Run a complete systems scan. Isolate the fault. Our time isrunning out. The Germans are becoming impatient. I don't trust these people. I never have. I'm not about tofurnish them with weapons that could be used against us. Return theprisoners to their holding cell. See that they get medical attention. Go. Bring the doctor immediately. Your voice sounds familiar, Captain. Have wemet? I believe I have two of your men. I think it would be mutually beneficial todiscuss this face to face. I was thinking of a more neutral location. There's a remote area outside the city. You have scanners. Examine the area before coming down. I'llhave three men with me. And your crewmen. The situation has changed. I'm sending you the coordinates. If you'reinterested, meet me in one hour. It's good to see you again, Captain. I apologise for the aggressiveness of our questioning. We were operating under a false impression. You have your men, Captain. Now it's your turn to reciprocate. I wish to discuss something with you. A species with your level of technology doesn't possess thecapability for time travel. As I suspected. What do you know about me? I see I was both right and wrong about you. You're not a temporalagent. But you're here to do their bidding. You've only heard one side of the story, Captain. The temporalagents who sent you here are a tyrannical sect imposing their will oncountless cultures throughout history. They enforce the Temporal Accords, preserve the time line. They manipulate the time line to serve their own needs. If you'veever dealt with them, then you know they do much more than watchhistory unfold. They interfere with events. They have an agenda. At least I don't hide my intentions. It's true, I don't agreewith the Temporal Accords. I believe that time travel is a technologyno different than your warp drive, to be utilized for the benefit ofall species. Societies, cultures can be improved through carefulmanipulation of historical events. I won't be drawn into a philosophical discussion. There's onesimple reason why you should help me, Captain. I can send you back to your century. Once I've defeated the temporal agents, I'll reverse the damagedone to your timeline. Your history will return to the way it was. I'mseverely limited by twentieth century Earth technology. The resourcesaboard your ship will greatly accelerate my task. Go back. Reunite withyour crewmen, and consider what I have said. A large amount of data has been stolen fromour computer system, Captain. We found trace amounts of bioresidue. The thief is from your time period. We've encountered his faction before. I want to speak withhim. And I suppose you aren't examining thetechnology he stole from us. And I reserve the right to destroy you. I have a plasma-cannon aimed at yourship, Captain. I want an answer to my proposal. We'll complete our objective with the resources at hand. Resumeyour work. Weapons of this complexity require extensive training to operate. Six hours. The planes must be readied for transport. We're leaving tonight. Begin preparations. Human leaders often speak of destiny. The conduit will hold. Our greatest scientist once said, Every moment we live, we aremoving through time. We've earned the right to chose which direction. The mastery of time has allowed us to perfect ourselves. To reach ourfull potential as a people and to vanquish those who oppose us. There'sjust one last enemy to deal with. Soon, history will belong to us. Wewill stretch out our hands and mold it according to our will. Not eventhe gods of our ancestors could have imagined such power. My brothers,we are going home. A fortuitous development. Let the Germans deal with them. Continue with the preparations. Activate the plasma weapon. Then deploy the squadron. Destroy them. Execute my order. I'm sorry, General, but I'm afraid I have to end our alliance. Destiny. No!"

Wipe that damn place off themap, and don't stop until you kill every last one of them, because whatthey Okay. I guess you know what you're doing.

Vowing to root out theparasitic elements that have crippled our economy since 1929 and toliberate the masses from the grip of financial profiteers, Together, wewill put Americans back to work. Two great nations marching side byside toward a bold future!"

11270,ENT,episode 77,ARCHER,"Thank you, Admiral. I've been told that people are calling us heroes. When it comesto my crew, you won't get any argument from me. But I think it's important that we remember the heroes who aren't withus. the twenty seven crewmen who didn't make it back. Without theirsacrifice, I wouldn't be standing here right now. None of us would. ButI'm sure I speak on behalf of my entire crew when I say it's good to behome. Scotch. I heard about your promotion. Congratulations, Captain. Cheers. You'll be at the debriefing tomorrow, won't you? I wouldn'twant to spoil any surprises. Besides, I've got more importantquestions. Seen any good movies while I was gone? I don't see a ring. I hope you don't mind if I steal some of these improvements. You might want to talk tosomeone about installing a lumbar support. You're going to spend a lotof hours in that chair. Ventral and dorsal torpedo launchers, pulsed phase cannons. I had an argument once with Captain Jefferies. He was one ofthe designers of the NX-Class. I told him I didn't want to be in command of a warship tryingto make first contact with new species. Jefferies was right. We neededthose weapons, and a hell of a lot more. The asteroids were loaded with trellium ore. We think theVulcans entered the field in order to mine it. It's an alloy that protects against spatial anomalies. Ships inthe Expanse used it to insulate their hulls. They attacked us the minute we docked. The trellium had a toxiceffect on the Vulcans. It damaged their neural pathways. They lost theability to suppress their emotions. The breach was an accident. We were trying to disable theirpower grid. There was no point. They were too far gone. Phlox made that determination. There was nothing we could do for them. I couldn't help them! No. What the hell does that mean? I just told you exactly what led to the ship's destruction. I'm not going to sit here and be accused of murdering thosepeople. Maybe that crew would still be alive if you'd been a littlemore helpful. You did everything you could to sabotage our mission. I gotmore help from the Andorians than I ever got from the High Command. This planet would be a cloud of dust right now if we'd listenedto you. How can you be taking his side? They don't lift a finger to help us and now I have to justifymyself to that son of a bitch? With all due respect, Admiral, I don't need a vacation. Mind if I ask what you're doing here? I'm not counting. Look what over? You may want to find someone with more field experience, aMACO. If I were you, I'd talk to General Casey about assigning anentire squad. Things have changed since Enterprise left Spacedock. You'llspend a lot of your time boldly going into battle. Did you read my reports? Mountain lion. Tracks are a few days old. How about that? Just to the left of Polaris. We found our first M-class planetaround that star. I doubt it. The air was filled with a psychotropic compound. After breathing it for a few hours, my senior officers nearly killedeach other. Maybe the Vulcans were right. Maybe we weren't ready. Look what it's gotten us. We almost lost Earth. If we weren't out there stirring up trouble, seven millionpeople might still be alive. I'm not sure there's much of a difference. No, we need them. But look at the Vulcans. They're notexplorers. They keep their ships close to home. You never know who'sgoing to come calling. Well, maybe you'll feel differently after you've delivered afew dozen eulogies. I'm not even sure what all right means anymore. You want to know why I'm out here? I figured this is the lastplace I'd run into anyone who'd want to shake my hand or take mypicture or tell me I'm an inspiration to their children. If they knewwhat I'd done. Does that include torture? Or marooning a ship full of innocentpeople? Because I don't remember reading those chapters in thehandbook. Why not? Are you telling me I have some kind of a death wish? What was that? You remember that planet I told you about? There was a mountainrange on the southern continent. The view was almost as amazing asthis. I think the view is fine from here. I'm glad you tagged along. What's that? Well, I was your superior officer. It wasn't appropriate. You're forgetting the climber's code. Ambassador. I want to apologise for what I said to you theother day. I was out of line. I'm glad we can finally agree on something."

I'm just trying to make sure your friend here is comfortable. Sitting in a bar full of so many strange looking aliens like us. Because if you weren't, if humans make you nervous for somereason, the Vulcan Consulate's on the other side of the bridge. I'llbet there's someplace there where someone like yourself could get anice, refreshing beverage. If your friend wants to go, you should let him go. You Starfleet people are the real problem. You fly all aroundspace telling every species you meet where to find Earth. Did it everoccur to you that might not be the smartest thing to do? Excuse me, Admiral. I don't take orders from you."
11278,ENT,episode 77,REED,"Not exactly travelling light, are you? Okay. I trust you'll be taking the proper precautions on thesurface. I'm surprised you haven't heard. An Andorian and two Rigelianswere attacked. Apparently the Xindi incident has caused a degree of xenophobia. It's hard to believe in this day and age. I'm told the Vulcans arestaying behind the walls of their compound. I don't think this is the same planet you remember, Doctor. People are looking for someone to blame and they don't care who it is. Well, thank you, that's very kind of you to say. Unfortunately, wecan't actually give tours of the ship. If that policy ever changes, youtwo will be the first to know. Do you think I wore this jacket to attract attention? Is there something we can help you with? We're not going anywhere, Doctor. Sir, Why don't you just go back to the bar? Doctor?"

11280,ENT,episode 77,SOVAL,"According to your log, the entire crew of the Seleya was killedwhen you triggered a reactor breach. As far as I can determine, you didn't try to save a singleVulcan crewman. Is that your medical opinion, Captain? Our specialists have examined the data you sent back. It's farfrom certain that the neurological damage was irreversible. T'Pol was exposed to the trellium. She recovered. There's no need to get emotional, Captain. You spent severalhours in the ship's auxiliary control room. In that time, did you tryto access the internal sensors, or download the computer database? So in effect, we don't know what really happened aboard theSeleya. Because of this oversight, we'll never have a complete pictureof the events that led to the ship's destruction. No one is accusing you of anything, Captain. I beg your pardon? Yes, you were. Captain. Your actions, while being morally questionable, werenecessary. I opposed your appointment as captain of Enterprise, butit's obvious now that I was wrong. T'Pol has told me that the Expansewould have someday encompassed hundreds of systems, including Vulcan. You've done a great service for both our worlds. Thank you."
11281,ENT,episode 77,T'POL,"Come in. You wanted something?Â TUCKER You could come with me. The transport leaves at eleven hundred hours. There's a guest room in my mother's home. I've never mentioned you. Commander Charles Tucker the third. You've told the Captain thatyou don't get to see as many alien cultures as you'd like. You've neverbeen to Vulcan. Tar'hana. There are frequent eruptions. We can schedule a tour of thecrater, if you're interested. Meaning? Vulcans appreciate beauty. Commander Tucker, I suggest Mother, you're home. Commander Tucker is my colleague. He wanted to visitVulcan. It's not yet midday. Why aren't you at the Science Academy? We had communication difficulties in the Expanse. It's from Koss. I have nothing to say to Koss. Former fiancÃ©. Good morning. Oh four hundred. We have to prepare the morning meal. As guests, it's expected ofus. The nar'ru vines have bloomed early this year. It sounds as if you're not enjoying retirement. I didn't know one was necessary. I've been offered a commission with Starfleet. If I accept, it could beseveral years before I'm able to return home. As I recall, you encouraged me to leave. A Starfleet posting is no less important than one with the HighCommand. I'm sure Father would have approved. Earth is supposed to be our ally. We shouldn't argue in front of a guest. Why are you here? You've received my letters. You know I'm not interested inmarriage. You have the option of choosing another mate. You should be aware I've been ill recently. It could take some time for me to recover, assuming it's evenpossible. What if I declare the kal-if-fee? You find this amusing. It's best if you leave. What do you mean? She retired. Why? Is that what you want, an absent wife? You should go. This retirement wasn't your choice. Did you? I don't understand. Why would the Ministry do this? Because of me. They blamed mefor the incident at P'Jem. They couldn't reach me on Enterprise, so they punished you. It'scriminal. How could you let them do this? That wouldn't be your concern. There's something I need to tell you. I've decided to marryKoss. If I join his family, my mother will regain her position at theAcademy. His father is a senior Minister with a great deal ofinfluence. The decision was mine. My mother resigned because of my actions. I've been negotiating with Koss's family. They've agreed we won't have to reside together, not right away. I'll remain on Enterprise for the time being. Trip, I have to do this for many reasons. I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, maybe she'd rather make a connection with someoneelse. I'm grateful that you're here."
11282,ENT,episode 77,TUCKER,"Well, it looks like you're taking enough clothes to last ayear. To Vulcan? Where would I stay? Oh, your mom's house, huh? What does she know about me? Aboutus? So you'd introduce me as? Eleven hundred hours, huh? I'd better start packing. What about that volcano we saw on the way down, Mount Tar'ana? It still active? Volcanoes, ancient ruins, fire plains. I'm not sure where tostart. So, this is where you grew up. It's not like I imagined. Well, it's beautiful. Well, I had no doubt about that. You always were a snazzydresser. I'm Charles Tucker. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. Come in. What time is it? You're kidding. Well, I'd be happy to take a look at it. If I can recalibrate awarp reactor, I ought to be able to handle a kitchen appliance. That's true for the most part. I just want to thank you for letting me stay here. T'Pol says thank you all the time. T'Pol's lucky. It's nice to have a place to go home to. I knew we had some kind of chemistry the first time we got intoan argument. I never had fun arguing with anyone before. I got theimpression T'Pol wasn't going to say anything to you. The field generator just needed a little adjustment. As good asnew. You know, if we have time when we get back to Earth, I'd liketo show you some sights, return the favour. Everything okay? Marry him? I don't get it. Are they forcing you to do this? You told me three years ago you didn't even love this guy. Soyou're just going to leave Starfleet, move back to Vulcan? Negotiating? That's real generous of them. And how am I supposed to take this? You're sorry. You brought me sixteen light years just to watchyou get married to someone you barely know. Come in. I'll be there as soon as I can. Know any good tailors? Aren't you bothered by the fact that T'Pol doesn't even carefor this guy? Informed her of what? I don't think I knew it until we were standing over that lavafield and she told me she was going to marry Koss. That's when it hitme. I was going to lose her. I wanted to tell her right there, but Icouldn't. I thought you didn't approve. If I say anything, T'Pol might call off the wedding. Or worse,not call it off. She's got enough pressure on her as it is. I don'twant to make things any more complicated. Â TUCKER Wouldn't miss it for the world."

11601,ENT,episode 77,ERIKA,"Excuse me. The bar's reserved for regular customers. Galactic heroes haveto sit at a table. Thank you. Cheers. So what was it like in the Expanse? Another World War epic. It swept all the awards. But youhaven't missed much. Earth's been holding its breath for the past year,wondering if the Xindi were going to come back and finish the job. Onthe bright side, there've been more weddings and births than everbefore. I'm married to Starfleet. Just like you. We've tied these stations directly in the primary junction. I won't say anything if you do me a small favour. My seniorofficer candidates. I'd like to get your opinion. You've served with a few of them. We've improved hull polarisation by twelve percent. We'll beable to hang in a firefight a little longer. Upgrades you recommended. What is it? I'm aware of that. You know better than to go climbing without a partner. You probably don't want to hear this, but Igot a call from my brother yesterday. They renamed my old high schoolafter you. How many is that, two, three dozen? That's just North America. I don't think Zefram Cochrane hasthat many schools named after him. So, did you get a chance to look 'em over? My senior officer candidates. Any suggestions for Tactical? I'm not sure how I feel about a military officer on the Bridge. Don't you think you're being a little cynical? Yes, Captain, I did. Hey. Good thing I have you to protect me. What? Maybe humans will go back someday, build a colony? Not ready? How long were we supposed to wait? Enterprise saved Earth. You weren't stirring up trouble. You were exploring. So what do you suggest? Put our starships in mothballs? That's not the mission either one of us signed up for. You all right? Want to talk about it? There's an old code among climbers. Anything that happens on the mountain stays there. You did what any captain would have done. Where are you going, Jon? Are you going to go climbing in themiddle of the night? It'd be a shame if you lost your footing. It's a long way down. But at least you wouldn't have to deal with these feelings anymore. You tell me. All I'm trying to do is get away from you. I look at you, and I see theperson I was three years ago. The explorer that my father wanted me tobe. I lost something out there, and I don't know how to get it back. Something I haven't done in a while. Whatever you lost, maybe Icould help you find it. We should have brought a camera. That's a good day's climb we've got ahead of us. We can reachthe summit by nightfall, but we should get moving. You know, there's still something I'm not quite clear about. Why did we stop seeing each other? You're not my superior anymore. I wonder ifStarfleet would approve? The captains of the only two warp five ships?"
11602,ENT,episode 77,PRIEST,"What ye are about to witness comes down from the time of thebeginning without change. This is the Vulcan heart. This is the Vulcansoul.

11603,ENT,episode 77,KOSS,"I need to speak with T'Pol. I want to hear about your life aboard thehuman ship. You must have many fascinating stories. The answer should be obvious. The decision isn't ours alone. My parents believe in the oldtraditions. For them, a betrothal cannot simply be dismissed. I don't want another mate. Ill? I can help. My father's a man of influence. I knows the finestdoctors in the province. I intend to go through with this. Is that what you want? A fight to the death? Perhaps your humanfriend would make a suitable challenger. No. Call a challenger if you wish. I'll do whatever's necessary. I may be able to help your mother. My father could have her reinstated. She was asked to resign. I've said more than I should. If we were to marry, you'd onlyhave to live on Vulcan for one year. You could resume your career withStarfleet after that. I'd want you to be happy."
11604,ENT,episode 77,T'LES,"You didn't tell me you were bringing a guest. Obviously. It's agreeable to see you. You appear well. Why is he here? This is the first time you've brought a colleaguehome with you. You both must be very tired after your journey. The guest room is on the south end of the house. I'm no longer an instructor there. I wrote you a letter. Didn'tStarfleet transmit it to your ship? I don't know why you're surprised. This was planned years ago. There's more to life than one's profession. Perhaps you'll learn thatone day. It seems that I'm not the only one who knew you were coming. You received this yesterday. Did you believe he had forgotten you? You're going to respond. He's your fiancÃ©. That is a matter for debate. It would be wise for you to speakwith him. I've had ample time to attend to them. You still haven't told me the reason for your visit. I thought perhaps you'd decided to rejoin the High Command. The gespar isn't fresh. My stasis unit needs to be replaced. My daughter's always been fascinated by alien worlds. She wasall too eager to finish her schooling and leave Vulcan. A mother is expected to push her young out of the nest. At somepoint, they're supposed to return. I'm told that on Earth a human childchooses their own path in life. They put their own wishes ahead oftheir family's. You've learned much from them, haven't you? Your father believed that our work should enrich Vulcan society. What's happened to you? Expressing gratitude is an Earth custom. I've noticed. I know that you are romantically involved with my daughter. There's no logic in denying it. How long have you been attracted toher? She didn't. I'm her mother. You've repaired it? If you have the time, perhaps you could repair my foodsynthesiser. Would you mind? Koss? It's difficult to meditate with you standingthere. That's not entirely accurate. I chose to retire rather than facedismissal. I was under investigation by the Security Ministry. Theyclaimed I had taken restricted data from the Academy archives. No. Their accusations were fabricated. I was told that if I left theAcademy they would end the inquiry. After the monastery was destroyed, the First Minister wasdismissed. You've made many enemies here. You've changed. Your emotions were always close to the surface,but you managed to suppress them. It's because of this CommanderTucker, isn't it? He's the reason why you refuse to bond with Koss. Doyou really believe that a human and a Vulcan can have a futuretogether? Imagine the shame your children would endure, assuming thatthe two of you could have children. Koss and his family are waiting. These clothes belonged to myhusband. They fit you well. She's fulfilling her family obligation. I met my husband onlyonce before we were joined. In time, we developed a deep connection toeach other. Have you informed T'Pol? You're in love with her. Vulcans may not express their emotions,but we are sensitive to them. There's still time. I may not condone your relationship, but it's important for herto have all the facts. It's time."

11607,ENT,episode 78,ARCHER,"I need to ask you some questions. It won't take long. You programmed a to unlock every security door in thebuilding. Why invest so much time and energy on things no one will everuse? Genetic engineering has caused a lot of suffering. Someone attacked a Klingon Bird of Prey. The entire crew wasmassacred. The ship is missing. Whoever's responsible jettisoned the Klingon crew into space. was recovered from the bodies. Not quite. They were Augments. Their genetically-enhanced matchedembryos stolen from a medical facility over twenty years ago. Stolen byyou. Soong used to work at Cold Station 12, a top secret medicalresearch station. Along with genetically-engineered embryos left over from theEugenics Wars. It's been kept from the public for obvious reasons. Now he now claims that he took them to a planet in the TrialusSystem and raised them. They were around ten years old when he wascaptured, a decade ago. We don't know. Neither does Soong. At least he claims hedoesn't. But he does think he can convince them to surrender without afight. There's also the fact that he spent time in the Borderland. The Klingons have threatened to retaliate with everythingthey've got. We're the fastest ship and the most experienced crew. Wehave to find the Augments and bring them back. It's the only way toavert a war. We launch in six hours. This is my Science Officer, T'Pol. My Tactical Officer, Lieutenant Reed. We've prepared some quarters. You'll be under guard at alltimes. If you should decide you need to clear your head. It's this way. I'll have the information sent to your quarters. I'll consider it. I like it. Here we are again. Wouldn'thave it any other way. Travis. I just received an intelligence report. AKlingon warship was spotted near Proxima colony. Admiral Forrest thinksthey could be conducting reconnaissance for a future strike. I wantedto keep you up to date. Small chance. One other thing. It's your first official day of duty, CommanderT'Pol. A present. It's from the earlytwentieth century. Should help keep you pointed in the right direction. I'm glad you're with us. Interesting way of saying hello. Hoshi? Keep firing. A weapon? They took nine people, including T'Pol. How do I get them back? That's not what I asked you. Archer to Bridge. Set a course for Verex Three, best possible speed. What'll happen to them there? I have the feeling you've found your way in. One step at a time. Give it time. Phlox. Transponder. It has a range of ten kilometres. That's enough. Make the engines a priority. When it's time to leave, I have a feelingwe're going to need all the speed we can get. Over here. Those devices on their necks. So if we try to beam them out? They sell their own people? Come on. T'Pol. You all right? Nine. We've located five, so far. We're working on a way to tryand Archer to Enterprise. We've located everyone, including T'Pol. I'm going to need sixkilos of tritanium cobalt. Make that nine. I'll explain later. Just get it ready. They normally remove the restraint after a sale. We used theextra tritanium to bribe one of the guards to deactivate it but leaveit on him. T'Pol's already been sold. We don't have time to try and buythem all. T'Pol could be shipped out any second. Work fast. Got it. Trip, start beaming them, five at a time. Trip, have you got everyone? Soong got away. Locate him and beam him up. Can you scan for his biosign? Trip, two to beam up. You knew exactly where the Orions were operating. You knewthey'd abduct members of my crew. Maybe you were even hoping they'd getyou. You were determined to escape, no matter who got hurt. Nine of my people were nearly sold into slavery. Two of themmay have permanent physical damage because of the restraints. Is that supposed to justify what you did? Then tell me how to find the Augments. You know where they'regoing. They're dangerous. Why me? My father has nothing to do with this. I'm going to find them, Doctor, whether you help me or not. This is Captain Archer of the Starship They were members of my crew. You kidnapped them. That isn't going to happen. Malcolm. Torpedoes. When he tried to escape, I saw him access a console. In the Brig. I can't allow that. My ship wouldn't have been in danger if we hadn't come lookingfor you. My orders are to take you back to Earth. You attacked a Klingon vessel. They're threatening war. You think he was talking about you? Soong, listen to me."

The Orions traffic in forced labour. We're being processed forauction. Ensign. Ensign. I don't know your name. Jeffrey, Enterprise will come. It may take some time.

We're getting hammered down here! Tucker to the Bridge. Two of my people justdisappeared. You wander off more than a step or two, we bring you right backhere. No, I don't. Tucker here. That's half our supply. Yes, sir. Why can't we just buy the rest of our people? What kind of people are these? Well, if I remember my history, these Augments you love so muchhad plenty of slaves. Oh. They were just treated like slaves. We're sending the code now. You and Soong are the only ones left. Soong's transponder signal, it's dead. We're trying, but there's too many peopledown there.

They believe it's Malik who liberated us from that rock. How can you say that? Malik's doing more than arguing with yourcommands. He's plotting against you. He wants to take your place. He told me. Malik's always wanted me. I knew he was planningsomething, so I let him think I wanted him as well. He said that you'reweak, that you're making all of us weak, that you're betraying Father'sprinciples, that if Father were here, he'd choose Malik to lead us. I told him everything. He thinks you're planning an attackagainst him. I'm sorry, Raakin. I've broken their security code. We'reready. Persis. Father, here's Malik."

Slaves are loose! Slaves are loose! You've got spirit. I mightjust keep you for myself. You've stolen our property! Disengage your warp drive, and deactivate your weapons."
11946,ENT,episode 78,SOONG,"I'm busy. VOICE Jonathan Archer. What brings you here? They're naming the prisonafter you? I'm kind of in the middle of something. Well. I suppose it's not every day one gets to speak to the manwho saved the planet. Please. I apologisefor the clutter. I'm not allowed traditional recording devices. I was particularly proud of that. I made it all the way toSausalito. On the rare occasion I get stuck on a problem, I find avigorous escape attempt helps to clear the head. Go ahead. They're sequences. That one is for a modificationof the human T-cell. It would render Sharat Syndrome a thing of thepast. That one increases the visual spectrum by five percent. Ofcourse, none of this will ever be tested. They clear out my room everyfew months. I'm told it all gets vaporised. How can a supposedly intelligent species reject technology thatwould enhance ability, relieve suffering? So did splitting the atom, yet the first ships to colonise thesolar system were nuclear-powered. But you're not here to discuss that. I read the reports. I understand the Klingons are quite annoyed. Looks like you might've saved Earth for nothing. Let me guess. Human? I see. Permission to comeaboard, sir? No need for an introduction. I admire your people very much. Weshare a similar view of humanity. That it could stand some improvement. I've heard of you, but I don't recognise your face. You're notgetting your fair share of publicity. We're on a starship soon to be at high warp. Where exactly wouldI go? If I could examine the samples the Klingons recovered, Icould tell you something about the current state of the Augments. A laboratory would be preferable, your Sickbay. Doctor Phlox'sreputation rivals my own, before I was imprisoned, of course. I'd enjoytrading notes with him. Malik. He wasthe rebellious one. Reminded me of myself when I was his age. I came tothink of them as my own children. I knew they'd survive. Well, I made some modifications of my own. I prefer to let my work speak for itself. I didn't realise you shared humanity's reactionary attitudetoward this field of medicine. But you don't approve of what I've done. We can't let past mistakes hold us back. Well, what makes you think I haven't? There never used to be Orions in this area. They must'veexpanded their range of operations. It's a shame. I really liked yourScience Officer. It's not going to be easy. They've most likely been taken to a processing station. Thenearest one's on Verex Three. They'll be ushered into their new profession, as slaves. Thesestations are heavily guarded. Only legitimate traders are permitted toenter. I had to establish a relationship with the Orions. They helpedme acquire certain goods and equipment I needed to survive. I can getyou inside, but I can't get your people out. You don't like me, do you, Commander Tucker? You probably blame me for what's happened to your Vulcan friend. Your crew could use a sense of humour. At least we know four of your people are still here. Doesn'tseem to be much demand for humans. Neurolytic restraints. Ingenious, really. They induce convulsiveseizures in disobedient slaves. If a slave attempts to leave thepremises. Wouldn't recommend it, not if you want them alive. Only the women. Orion females are known for their extremeappetites, their innate skills. We made a wrong turn. Thank you so much, though. Thank you foryour help. Really, thank you. Let's go. Nine. I'd say they're not unlike some of your ancestors, judging fromyour accent. They were more like subjects. Sorry, Captain. I hope you find your people. Thanks for theride. There was an outside chance. No one was injured. I didn't take this action lightly. I'm simply saying it wasn't easy for me to place you and yourcrew in jeopardy. I respect you, Captain. They didn't steal a Klingon ship to go sightseeing. They're the future. They're stronger, smarter, free fromsickness, with life spans twice as long as our own. You, more thananyone, should appreciate what this means. Your father suffered from Clarke's Disease. His final years weremarked with extreme pain. He didn't need to suffer. Genetic engineering could've curedhim. Those who want to suppress my Augments are the same ones whocondemned your father to death. Turn the ship around, Captain. Go home. Leave them alone. Persis? I can't believe it. Malik. I knew we'd see each other again. I'm proud of you. Of allof you. There's nothing to say, Captain. Let them go. Their ship's disabled. By the time it's repaired, we'll be faraway. It's been a pleasure, Captain. Take my advice. Go home and startlearning how to speak Klingon. There were times back on Earth when I doubted myself, my work. But seeing you all, I know that everything I've fought for was worthit. We're going to build a new world. But we can't begin that task justyet. Thousands of your brothers and sisters are waiting to be born. Let's go get them.

11947,ENT,episode 78,RAAKIN,"A fine ship. I didn't sanction this attack. If you'd failed, they would'vecome after all of us. Their government knows what we did. They have ships hunting forus right now. That was my decision, not yours! You've forgotten who I am? Have you?! Say it. Don't ever make me ask you again. Notifyme when the rest of our supplies are onboard. We're leaving orbit. He argues with every command I give, defies me in front of theothers. They've forgotten how we've stayed alive all these years. Myresolve was what kept us from starving to death on that rock. You agree with them. I hear it in your voice. How do you know that? I will betray Father's principles. I'm going to kill my ownbrother. See for yourself. Is this the move youexpected? It's between us. I saved your lifeonce when we were children, pulled you from the river when you fell in. Now, ten years later, you're plotting against me. Doesn't look that way from here. You would never have trappedme like this. Saul, Jaya, listen to me. I am your brother."
11948,ENT,episode 78,MALIK,"Wing-mounteddisruptor cannons, photon torpedo launchers. This ship's an arsenal. I thought you'd be pleased. I didn't fail. They won't find us. It was time for us to leave this godforsakenplanet. No, Raakin. You are our leader. Raakin is taking us to another system wherewe can live out our lives in peace. But I'm sure he's already told youthat. This isn't what our father would've wanted. He didn't raise usto run away and hide. You could try to convince Raakin to reconsider. It doesn't suit you. Playing the victim. You chose Raakin. You wanted the strongestfor yourself. Is he going to move against me? I remember. I'm the strongest and the smartest. But I have. It's between us. They only listen to me now. There was a time when I looked up toyou, when I called you my brother. When you rejected our father's wishes, you stopped being one ofus, and when that happened, you ceased to exist. Which makes this an act of mercy. Get rid of him. Don't. Not for him. I know he's on this ship. We received his signal. You were expecting us. Where is he? In a prison cell? I want to speak with him. We saved your ship. What is it you want with us? Earth considers my father a criminal. Why? Because he brought usto life. You want to take us back to a world that opposes our veryexistence. That's not our problem. We don't care what happens to you. Humanity is no longer relevant. To quote one of your philosophers,Nietzsche, mankind is something to be surpassed. I'm about to attack you. You see? Even with a warning, you're not fast enough. I'll tear out his throat. Lower your weapons. Now. Persis. I'll killhim. What should we do with them? But they'll just come after us."

11951,ENT,episode 79,ARCHER,"Previously, on EnterpriseSOONG Someone attacked a Klingon bird-of-prey. The entire crew wasmassacred, the ship's missing. They were Augments. They're dangerous. Everything you'd need to keep a small colony of humans alive. Looks like this place doubled as a classroom. Trip? I need to know exactly what kind. It's important. I'll be damned. We're not going to hurt you. We just want to talk. Malcolm. See? We're friends. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer. We're from Earth. For an Augment, he didn't put up much of a fight. How's the jaw? I'm sorry about that, but you didn't give me much choice. Itold you my name. That's an unusual nickname. His handicapped friend. Is that why you were left behind? Because you're different? Udar. I need to find out where they went, the others. I'm trying to help them. That's not true. Your brothers and sisters are in danger. They attacked aKlingon ship. If the Klingons find them before we do. Go ahead, Trip. I think Soong is headed to Cold StationTwelve. It's the embryos from the Eugenics Wars that Soong's after. He took nineteen, but there are over eighteen hundred more. At the time, it was too controversial. Earth's governmentscouldn't decide how to handle the issue, so they put them into coldstorage. I just got off with Admiral Forrest. We've been authorised touse whatever force necessary to stop Soong. I need all the speed youcan give me. How's the patient? Good. I just reviewed the crew manifest for C-12. One of thenames is Doctor Jeremy Lucas. He's Senior Medical Director. I thought you should know. Consider it done. Phlox tells me he's ready to free up this biobed. If you've had enough Sickbay food, I'd like you to join me inthe Captain's Mess. No. See you in an hour. Phlox tells me you'd been living on your own for quite a while. You must be pretty resourceful to survive by yourself out there. Didn't look like a very friendly planet. When you get back toEarth, you should consider going to school. You've got a lot of catching up to do. What makes you think you're going to prison? I don't know what you've been told about Earth. You're notgoing to be punished. Soong is not your father. Your biological father was Miklos Karlovassi. He was a geophysicist. We got the information from Soong's computer. Your mother'sname was Irina. She was an athlete, decathlon. Won a silver medal in theOlympics. We've got a lot of historical data on both your parents. You're welcome to look at it. Coffee. When does your hibernation begin? You're worried about Doctor Lucas? We're getting there as fast as we can, Phlox. I doubt Soong gave him the whole story. The official number was thirty million. Some historians say itwas closer to thirty five. What do you know about Clarke's syndrome? My father died of it when I was twelve. He had frequent pain, hallucinations, he talked to people whoweren't there. Often couldn't recognise me or my mother. The last twoyears of his life Maybe Soong has a point. He broke the law. That's why he was in prison. And that's whyI'm going to make sure he goes back. Denobula perfected geneticengineering a long time ago, but you never came close to destroyingyourselves. Or maybe your instincts had caught up with your intellect. Food's getting cold. Any sign of the bird-of-prey? Put it up. This only ends one way, Doctor. I'm betting you're not a cold-blooded killer. I want proof that the hostages areunharmed. Let me speak to Lucas. Doctor. All stop. Bring us about. If I didn't, I wouldn't have asked you to come along. Energise. How long before they run out of air in the control hub? Smike? You're going to spend the rest of your life in prison. They lied to you. Why are you so surprised? Whenever a group of people startbelieving they're better than everyone else the results are always thesame. You need it from someone. T'Pol! Execute your orders! To initiate the station's self-destruct sequence. In a few seconds, this place will be dust. It wasn't my idea. The orders came from Starfleet, but afterseeing this I can't say I disagree. You've already killed over twenty five people. Your existencehas a pretty high price. Leave him alone! Whatever I can do to help. Stick around and find out. Smike. Where is it?

Why weren't these embryos destroyed after the war? None. It could be hiding behind any one of the larger asteroids. To prevent us from getting a transporter fix. It's a logical conclusion. Agreed. End transmission. Bring up the data file. Proceed. We'll destroy it ourselves. It's not the preferred solution, but it's all we have. Loadphotonic torpedoes. Mister Mayweather? Take us in. Lock weapons. Return fire. They're trying to draw us away from the station. Hold your course. Target the facility. Who's on the shuttle? Soong. Fire torpedoes."
11963,ENT,episode 79,TUCKER,"Protein resequencer. Water purifier. With that and their screwed up genes,it's no wonder they turned out the way they did. Interfaces. They look a lot like the ones we have in ourSickbay. I'd say they took medical equipment with them. I'll see what I can find out. Tucker to Captain Archer. The missing equipment? They wereincubators. Artificial wombs. Isn't that where he used to work? I thought Soong stole the embryos. That's why he took the incubators with him. You'll have it. I've modulated the transporter frequency to match the station'scontainment field. If you register at all on their sensors, it'll looklike a field echo. Sounds like what happens when acommunicator goes down. They've been captured. We have to make sure. T'Pol? The station's still there. It's safe to say we're going to needanother plan. That thing's buried inside an asteroid. Starboard nacelle. They fire, then move off. A few more like that, we're going to be a part of this asteroidfield. They're launching a shuttle.

His is similar to theothers, but not identical. He was born with none of their enhancedabilities. He's doing fine. Ready to be discharged. In his last correspondence, he mentioned he was beingtransferred. He didn't say where. I appreciate it. Captain, I spent a few months at C-12 myself. Iknow the security protocols, I'm familiar with the technology. I'd liketo be included in the landing party. Thank you. I'm approaching a new sleep cycle. Not for another few weeks, but I would like to increase my bodymass by at least ten percent. To tell you the truth, I'm not veryhungry. We've been friends a very long time. You might be interested to know Smike's become quite the studentof Earth history. He's been reading up on the Eugenics Wars. I'm quite familiar with the subject myself. Human intellect andhuman instinct were out of sync. So many people were killed. I can understand why Earth banned genetic engineering. It's a degenerative brain disorder that afflicts humans. I'm sorry. And you were thinking if genetic engineering had been permitted I've had time to examine his work more closely. I'm forced toadmit some of it is extremely inventive. He's really quite brilliant. It's a shame such a man has to remain incarcerated. Perhaps we were simply fortunate. Life support runs through this relay. Half an hour. They should start feeling the effects within ten,fifteen minutes. Even an Augment needs oxygen. That should do it. Jeremy. Don't move."

You were leading us before, and now he is. You can't acceptthat. I won't listen to this. Let me go. I don't like what you're thinking. Cold Station Twelve, this is medical ship Barzai, transmittingsecurity code. Transmitting. Why not? That's true. We don't have enough masks. He's wrong, Captain. We're already here. We have to hurry.

Others say the Augments began fighting amongthemselves. Whoever started it, the war devastated Earth. Millionsperished. And when it was over people like you were feared. Humans willalways fear you. They fear your power, your intellect. They fear youbecause you're everything they want to be, but can't be. Which is why Ibrought you here, where it's safe. I've raised you like my own. Youcall me Father. But I'm only watching over you. You belong to thefuture, and someday you will fulfill humanity's promise. Malik. Many others, waiting, asleep. And someday, it'll be your duty towake them, set them free. Back to the present We'll have to reach this sublevel. Security personnel arelocated here and here. No. We're not going there to take lives. No one is to be killed. Is that understood? Malik? This was Raakin's. I gave it to him when hewas five. He was a good student. He loved astronomy. We'd sit at night,and I'd point out the stars. He could name every one. Where's yourbrother, Malik? No one will say anything. I only know he's not here. Tell me what happened. What happened to him? He was your brother! Malik, it's my fault. I left you alone. I should have stayed with you. You were just children. Shh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Malik. I'm sorry. Barzai, stand down and prepare to beboarded. You don't need masks. When I was Senior Medical Director, I had access to thoseembryos. Do the lights in your office flicker every now and then? Faulty power relay. You wouldn't believe how many times I askedthem to fix it. Ten years later, they still haven't done a thing. Puthim with the others. I believe him. Tell me. I can't believe I held you back in math. Captain. I wish I could say it's been a longtime. I think you've underestimated the variables,about eleven of them. No one will be harmed if you leave this systemimmediately. Turn your ship around. Now. Go ahead. That's about tochange. You're still approaching this station. Do you have any idea what a Klingondisruptor will do to a human skull at this range? You're going to leave mewith an awful mess to clean up. Conversation's over. He dies. Now turn around. That's a good captain. How long? Keep working. Get him in here. Malik. Malik! I want to put an end to this, Doctor. We know you can get to the embryos. You accessed the stasischamber just last week. I implore you. Give us what we came for, and we'll leave you inpeace. What's that? That language is unbecoming of a man of science. Bring in one of his colleagues. No. It isn't necessary. Are you familiar with Symbalene blood burn? Thevascular lining literally boils away. Actually, Mother was a chemist. Believe me, I don't want to, but I'm out of options, Doctor. Thecode! This is on your conscience, then, not mine. His temperature's rising quickly. Bloodpressure's approaching critical. There's still time, Doctor. Just say the word, I'll release the antipathogen. Right about now, his extremities feel like they're on fire. Butit's the capillaries, starting to burst. Watch. I'm asking you, one doctor to another. Stop this. Is it worth this man's life? I can save him! How can you let this happen? Tell me the code! The code! Release the antipathogen. Do it! Am I going to spend the rest of my life trying to get rid of you? Udar? How is this They told me you were dead, that youwere sick. What was? Why? You all went along with this? I don't need a history lesson from you. We have your people. I asked you not tointerfere. Now, Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. What are these orders? You'd kill us all, rather than let the embryos be born. Looks like this place isn't turning to dust. Sorry to disappoint you. Malik. Stop. Stop! Input the code. Get him out of there. You come with us. I understand. I hope you have a long, happy life. I came here so many times just to look at them. I remember whereeach of you was kept. You were there right next to Saul. Persis, Yavar. It was so hard to choose nineteen out of so many. I never thought I'd see this sight again. Maximum thrusters."

12292,ENT,episode 79,MALIK,"Whenyou rejected our father's wishes, you stopped being one of us, Raakin. Are there others like us? A direct hit to this power conduit would demolish their lifesupport systems. All we'd have to do is wait a couple of hours. But we could walk in unopposed. But what if they don't give us a choice? Yes. Understood, Father. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Doctor Soong andhis Augments have escaped on a Klingon bird-of-prey. Without any otherleads, we've proceeded to the co-ordinates Soong gave us when we beganthis mission. I don't know what you've been told. He's dead. He turned his back on your word. He didn't want to liberate theothers. I killed him. We were arguing. He pulled out a knife. I drewmine, he came at me. The next thing I remember there was bloodeverywhere. It was an accident. I tried to save him, I tried. I'm sorry. Father. I didn't mean to hurt him, I'm sorry. No. No, Father. He's different than I remember. The man who raised us would never risk our lives to protect ahuman. We'll find out. Why not? He's human. I used to believe that. Why shouldn't I lead? Augments should be led by Augments. Don't be angry with me. I'm just thinking out loud. Then I'll stop. Stay with me. He's lying. Father. He lied. Doctor Lucas, about the embryos. Station access log. Father. Some men are braver with their own lives than they are with thelives of others. No, not here. In there. There are thousands of pathogens stored here. Some kill withinminutes. The longer we're in this facility, the greater the chance thatmore ships will come and they might not back down like Enterprise. It's the only way to make him talk. Is one human being worth allour lives and everything you've worked for? Go. Father? No! It was Raakin's order. Banishment. He wasn't strong enough. We were defending our right to exist. It could get higher. They're friends. I heard them talking. Is this true,Doctor? Let's find out. You'll tell us what we want to hear, or you'll watch him die,too. Telurian plague. I like the sound of that. Identifying the most dangerous pathogens. Can't hurt to have a little insurance. They've been transferredto the stasis modules. Take two people with you, load them onto theshuttle. I wasn't sure how I'd justify killing you. Now you've given methe perfect excuse. Hold onto that. You're a competent fighter, but that isn't good enough. I wish I had time to continue our little match. I'm enjoying it. But this will be almost as satisfying. Five minutes after we leave,every stasis field in this station will shut down, releasing hundredsof pathogens. I wonder which one will kill you first. I like you, Captain. I can't allow my brother to die in such away. This will be much less painful. They've launched a torpedo."

There's fluctuation in the life support relay on level four. It's Enterprise. They cut us off. The stasis chamber is opening. It worked. They're beautiful. Father?"
12295,ENT,episode 79,SMIKE,"Leave me alone. Get out of my way. Who are you? It hurts. My real name's Udar, but my brothers and sisters call me Smike. It's from Nicholas Nickleby. I would've slowed them down. Smike. I'm not telling you anything. You're from Earth. You don't want to help them, you want to killthem. I won't betray my brothers and sisters. Then more Klingons will die. You'll never stop them, Captain. Noone will. So I've been told. Do I have a choice? I left the camp about a year ago. It wasn't that hard. School? How can I go to school if I'm in prison? I'm an Augment. That's not what my father said. What do you mean? How do you know that? Do you really think I can help? Doctor Phlox missed something when he examined me, Captain. I dohave one enhanced ability. I can hear like they do. They're coming. Father. I'm going to stay. You too, Father."

Arm torpedoes. Open a channel. This isCaptain Archer. Forward plating's holding. Return fire. Concentrate all fire on their engines. Hold your fire. Magnify. Bio-signs on the shuttle? Can you get a transporter lock? Murdering hostages is turning into a new hobby for you. This isn't over, Doctor. Go ahead. You don't sound a hundred percent sure. Send the coordinates to Mister Mayweather. Lay in a pursuitcourse, maximum warp. Archer to Engineering. Is there a problem with thecamouflage? Universal translator. Did you update the database? Let's hope this guy speaks one of them. Open a channel. Attention, cruiser. If you come any closer to my ship, you'll be firedupon. My name isn't your concern. The last time I checked this was still Klingon territory. I don't take orders from a mere governor. We're on importantbusiness for the High Council. That matter is classified. You expect me to turn on a transponder and let every ship inthe area know that we have the Chancellor on board? He had important negotiations with the Orions. We're taking himback to Kronos. If I were you, I wouldn't be making allegations aboutChancellor M'Rek over an unsecure channel. I'm sure you didn't. It would be best if you made no mention ofthis to your superiors, or you might find yourself commanding a garbagescow. Qapla'. What is it? Can you get a fix on it? Is that so? What were you doing in that escape pod? Your story doesn't sound very plausible. I think we weregetting close to finding your Augments. You may have put yourself intothat escape pod to throw us off. You've made it clear you'll do anything for them. Lie, murder,maybe even sacrifice yourself. What do you care what happens to Earth? You believe yourchildren are the future of humanity. Doctor Lucas already told me about the missing toxins. You didn't know? You had to see him murder someone in front ofyou. None of that would have mattered in the end. It's in theirnature. They were engineered to be this way. Superior ability breedssuperior ambition. One of their creators wrote that. He was murdered byan Augment. Work with Soong. He'll show you how to scanfor their warp trail. I want to intercept them before they reach thecolony. I believe him. Is that a problem? Do what you have to do. How long until we're in visual range? Same as before, Hoshi. Hail them again. If we don't reachthe colony before that bird-of-prey, millions of your people will bekilled. Power down weapons. Stand by to deploy the grappler. Take usout of warp. Malcolm? On my mark, Travis. Malcolm? Full impulse. Hold your speed. Hold your speed. Resume course for the colony, maximum speed. Stay with them, Travis. long until we're in weapons range? Trip. Travis. Take us out of warp as close as you can. Malcolm. Hard about. What about phase-cannons? Lock onto their Bridge. Stand aside, Doctor! What good will that do? Do what he says. Fire when ready. I'll contact Starfleet on your behalf. Let them know that youhelped us. You're not going to the brig. I'm taking you to crew quarters. No one's destroyed anything. It's being stored in a securelocation. Maybe someday, we'll figure out how to use it to benefithumanity. Good-bye, Doctor."

Perhaps we could fake a Klingon warp signature. Forward plating's holding. Their warp field's fluctuating. They'll be in visual range in less than two minutes. They're altering course. It's a lot bigger than the last one. This one's a D5 class battlecruiser. Aft plating is failing. We may be able to surprise them with a torpedo if we drop toimpulse. Two more seconds, Captain. Ready, sir. They're targeting the grappler. We're losing the grappler. Weapons are standing by. A direct hit to the Armoury. We've lost hull plating, torpedolaunchers.

You also haven't joined us at the Captain's table since we leftEarth. You've been avoiding me. I'm still adjusting to it myself. What do you mean? Subspace distortion. Zero point four light years.

It is a ship, but it's not the bird-of-prey. Captain Archer tothe Bridge. It's a Klingon vessel. They're on anintercept course. Two minutes. They're targeting our reactor. The shearing force is approaching critical. They can't create a warp field. They're disabled. They've detected us. They're accelerating. Two minutes, but the bird-of-prey will reach the colony inseventy three seconds. They're preparing to fire. Ten seconds. They've launched the weapon. It will reach the atmosphere intwelve seconds.

It would take a fewhours, but it should be doable. That's quite a mess they've got to clean up. They're fine. They moved into a new house in Mississippi. It'snot like the old place in Panama City, but it's pretty nice. Why do youask? There hasn't been a lot of time to catch up. What are you trying to say? Well, maybe I have.

I don't have a lot of time. The aftlauncher's still offline, and Father wants me to You can't. That was different. This is our father. Don't do this to him. That's not true. Please, Father. There's no other way. I'm sorry, Father. If I didn't go along with him, he would'vekilled me. No, we'll never get to them. Malik's posted guards at everyvital system. I've disabled the internal sensors. Itshould be some time before anyone notices one of the escape pods ismissing. You've been quiet. Maybe he disabled it. If Father didn't do it, then who?

What are you saying? No one was to be killed without my express order! If you disobey me again, I'll lock you in the targ pit. Youwon't see the light of day for a month. Do I make myself clear? What's our speed? Not fast enough. The port inducer assembly's been damaged. Go toEngineering and repair it. You're a bright boy, Malik. I'm sure you'll figure it out. Once we're safely through Klingon space,we'll set a course for these coordinates. The Klingons call it KlachD'kel Brakt. I call it the Briar Patch. It's a little catchier, don'tyou think? You should have read more of the books I left for you. Theregion is flooded with radiation from supernova remnants. The Klingonshave never mapped it. There are signs of at least two habitable planetsinside the Briar Patch. It's unlikely anyone will find us. The embryos need to mature in a safe environment. All right. What course would you set? Botany Bay is a myth. There's no evidence it ever existed. Even if you're right, the ship was lost, never to be heard fromagain. The matter is not open for debate. Alter our heading. Set acourse one eight four mark three. We're going to the Briar Patch. I'llbe in my lab. Come in, Malik. You have to stop challenging my authority in front of theothers. I'm willing to overlook the things you've done. But you have totrust that what I'm doing is best for all of us. You used to have faithin me. I know it wasn't easy after I left. I'll be ready to incubate the first of them in a few hours. These base-pairs sequences regulate the neurotransmitter levelsin their brain. If I can modify them, aggression and violent behaviourwill be removed. I'm correcting a defect in its genome. Genetic engineering wasin its infancy when you were created. They weren't able to repair allthe mistakes. I didn't know how until recently. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. Have you identified it? Let's see them. Increase speed. They outgun us three to one. The Denobulan pilot. Put her aboard the shuttle. Go! Scan for any planets along our flight path. Take us out of warp. No one's been Killed, Captain. That ship is caught betweentwo thermal layers. It should be relatively safe for four or fivehours. Enough time for you to mount a rescue mission. {Bridge] Good-bye, Captain. Disconnect that circuit before you power the relay. You mightdamage it. Excellent work. What is it? And what do you suggest we do, turn ourselves in? You did what?! A single torpedo would never make it through their hull plating. What you're proposing is mass murder. Go back to the Bridge. Return to your station. Captain's Starlog, Supplemental. We've rescued thepilot of the Denobulan shuttle. Fortunately, her injuries were minor. Trip and T'Pol are trying to enhance our sensors in an effort to findthe bird-of-prey. Persis? Four of you to subdue me? Is that so? There's no time for this. You all have work to do. What about the millions you plan to kill with that bioweapon? Don't tell me it's visiting hour. You did the right thing. If he deploys that weapon, he'll beconfirming everything they've said about Augments for the last hundredand fifty years. They'll destroy all of you. You have to help me stophim. We can sabotage the engines or the torpedo launchers. You have to get me off the ship. Be careful, he might suspect you. Captain. What took you so long? You have to alter your You have to alter your course. My children. The Augments are planning to attack a Klingoncolony. What do you think? I was waiting for you. You're the only onewho can stop them! I didn't come back because I missed our livelydebates. Please, please, you have to do as I ask. You're not serious. If the Klingons retaliate against Earth, it'll make the XindiIncident look like a lovers' quarrel. Captain. Captain, contact C-12! Three hundred kilograms ofbiotoxins are missing from their inventory. Malik stole them without my knowledge. He's going to use them onthe colony. You saw what he did on the station. You know what he'scapable of. What do you want me to say? That you were right about them, andI was wrong? Maybe things would have been different if I'd been therefor them, if Starfleet hadn't locked me away. How long can we sustain warp five? Adjust the scanning frequency fifteen megahertz. Sorry about that business with the Orions. Hope you weren't permanentlyinjured. Someone's a little protective of Commander T'Pol. Is that them? Captain, if I may. Captain Archer and his crew arehonourable people. Let them continue on their way. Drop out of warp, or we'll destroy your ship! I tried. I wouldn't recommend that, Captain. Their sensors are farsuperior. They'll detect it. No, no, no! Their Bridge is protected with dispersive armour. Your weaponswill never penetrate it. Target your cannons here. Behind their sensor array. Their main plasma junction's located there. A direct hit woulddisable their entire power grid. Trust me. Are they still alive? Let me talk to him. Malik. Malik, it's Father. Don't do this. Some of your brothersand sisters are still alive. The embryos. Please, please, please! Malik! I can't believe they're gone. All of them. Uh, we're heading thewrong way. You're alive. You could at least let me finish my work, before you take itaway and destroy it. I wouldn't count on it. I've been thinking. Perfecting humanity may not be possible. Cybernetics. Artificial lifeforms. I doubt I'll finish the work myself.

12639,ENT,episode 80,MALIK,"Why shouldn't I lead? Augments should be led by Augments. You'll tell us what we want to hear, or you'll watch him die,too. Every stasis field in this station will shut down, releasinghundreds of pathogens. I wonder which one will kill you first. We've crossed into Klingon space. We won't be seeing Archer again. He's dead. I had no choice. He attacked us, tried to escape. Yes, Father. I'm not an engineer. This is your plan? To hide again? Starfleet isn't going to give up so easily. They'll send otherships. This gas cloud won't protect us. I'm not certain. But I know that running away isn't the answer. Are you familiar with the name Botany Bay? It's also the name of a pre-warp vessel launched at the end ofthe Great Wars. The ship carried many of our brethren, including KhanNoonien Singh. All records of the launch were destroyed. They didn't want to befollowed. That's exactly my point. Khan was a great leader, but he madeone fatal mistake. He ran from his enemies rather than face them. We'vespent our entire lives running and hiding. When are we going to make astand? You asked for me? Can't a son disagree with his father? I thought we were family. I was a child. I didn't know any better. How are the embryos? You're manipulating its DNA. You're changing its personality. Did you fix these mistakes in the rest of us? What right do you have to tamper with their genome? You don't know that this is a defect. Maybe this is the way ourcreators wanted us to be. We should engage them. Father! Warp trail's been dispersed. Enterprise won't be able to followus. There's something else we need. Father! Ineed to speak with you. We've underestimated them. Starfleet isn't going to stop untilthey find us. Before we left C-12, I beamed aboard two dozen canisters ofbiogenic agents. We can modify a torpedo to carry the pathogens. I wasn't talking about the Enterprise. We use it against theKlingons. The Qu'Vat colony is less than four light-years away. If wedetonate the torpedo inside the upper atmosphere, it'll scatter thepathogen across the entire planet. Every organism on the surface willbe dead within days. When the High Council hears that humans havedecimated their colony, they'll launch a counterstrike. The Klingonswill keep Starfleet busy for years. There is no other choice. How long will it be before Starfleetturns to the Klingons for help in finding us? This is the only way toguarantee our survival. What happened to you in prison? You're not the man who raisedus. The man who was willing to do whatever was necessary. You won't have to answer to him any longer. I'm taking command. I've already spoken with everyone on the Bridge. They're behindme, but I need to know where you stand. You helped me before. He may have raised us, but that doesn't make him our father. He'll never be one of us. He's given me no choice. I have a plan to protect us fromStarfleet and the Klingons, and he won't even consider it. You knowwhat he's doing with the embryos? He's altering their genome. Makingthem weak and docile, like ordinary humans. Go to his lab, talk to him yourself. I know how much he means toyou. I have feelings for him, too. He'll be treated with respect. Youhave my word. Are you with me? Father, please come with us. The crew is united behind me. Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be. No one else has to die. Lock him in his quarters. Soong didn't get off this ship without help. The sensor gridwasn't damaged in the attack. Someone took it offline to cover hisescape. He would've needed the security codes. I never gave them to him. Can you think of anyone? He's been in the weapons bay for a day and a half, modifying thetorpedo. Maybe I should torture him, just to make sure. What do youthink? Only four of us have the codes. Of those four, you and I are theonly ones who weren't on the Bridge when Soong escaped. Your heart's beating faster. Perhaps it's trying to tell mesomething. Are you going to use that on me? You shouldn't have done that. I'll miss you. We'll detonate the torpedo over the southern hemisphere. That'llensure the maximum number of casualties. What's the weapon's status? The Enterprise. Increase to maximum speed. Load the torpedo. Stand by to fire as soon as we drop out of warp. Do as I say! How much longer? Take us into low orbit. Fire. Would you rather they go to prison with you? There's no place for us on Earth or anywhere else. Better to die here. I'll see you soon. You betrayed us all! Goodbye, Father. Captain's Starlog, May 27, 2154. Our actions at theKlingon colony appear to have satisfied the High Council. They'vecalled off their plans to retaliate against Earth."

I wasn't told to expect the head of the HighCommand. Twelve Vulcans died in the blast, Ambassador. Andorians? Why would they attack ourembassy? So far, we've done our best to remain neutral, and theAndorians know that. They have nothing to gain by attacking us. I've never heard of that species. Surak I've heard of. He's the father of Vulcan logic. So why would these Syrrannites want to attack our embassy? It'shardly an act of logic. Is there any evidence connecting Syrrannites to the bombing? I intend to. Since you had her on record, does that mean she's beenarrested before? Do you know anything about her? All right. We've got a solid start. Now we need to find her. Of course. Vulcan sovereignty. Lieutenant Reed and CommanderT'Pol will work with you. Chief Investigator. Forty three people died in the bombing. Twelve Vulcans and thirty one humans. We want her as much as you do. If you're lost, Ambassador, I can direct you to your shuttle. He always put the mission first. We have to make that possible, despite the High Command. We have evidence. A Syrrannite? And she never told you? Like T'Pau. Looks old. Eighteen hundred years ago? And you think your mother is somewhere along that path? She didn't want Koss to know about the map. With any luck, wecan use this to find your mother, and T'Pau. It's a Vulcan desert. I expect it'll behot. I'll be careful. You've got Enterprise. You and Malcolm keepthe investigation going up here, and whatever the Vulcans tell you,believe the opposite. Present company excepted. Ambassador. It already has. Energise. You keep saying supposedly. You don't believe Surak did thethings they said he did? There must be some record of it. Let me guess. With the originals lost, whatever's left is opento interpretation. I find it familiar. We should get moving. I thought technology didn't work here. No wonder the Syrrannites like it here. What the hell was that? How long before it starts to lose interest in us? You had one of those? How slightly? Porthos doesn't try and eat me when I'm late with his dinner. I can believe that. Sounds like that Klingon opera Hoshi made us listen to. That's quite a trick. Jonathan Archer. May we ask your name? We could ask you the same thing. I'm on a pilgrimage to study Surak and logic. T'Pol is myteacher. If it's all the same, I'll walk with you, too. I'll stick to the sand-covered parts wherever I can. You'd better protect your eyes from the glare. Ever since I met T'Pol. I'm new at this. You tell me. I'm familiar with Newton's First Law of Motion. I imaginethey're pretty much the same. Have you? I've dealt with the High Command. Vulcans can lie and cheatwith the best of them. That only leaves one option. We have to tell him what he wantsto know, the truth. Is that going to be a problem? You seem to know a lot about us. I'm guessing that means youknow why we're here. How long do these sand-fire storms usually last? Maybe we should be. They seem to think that it is. That you and your leader believein a corrupted version of Surak's teachings. What's a katra? Syrrannite's conduct mind-melding? I've been told Vulcans have never been explorers. T'Pol! Easy, easy, easy. Arev. Carry what? Arev. I'm fine. He said something in Vulcan. Vokau. I think he punched me. The storm's over? He said we weren't far from the T'Kareth Sanctuary. We shouldkeep moving. They're following a grid search pattern. No sensors, but theycan still make visual contact. We have to find cover before the suncomes up. That way. That's where the Syrrannites are. I'm good for a few more days. Right. No. Over here. Don't resist."

If there's a gravity switch, it'll detonate in the matter stream. Negative, Enterprise. Stand by. I'm going to attempt to scan it. Yeah. If I had designed that bomb, I'd rig it to go off theinstant a sensor beam made contact. Look on the bright side. If itdetonates, we'll never know. Steady. There's Vulcan on thesecontrols. So much for blaming Andorians. Boosting scan resolution. Oh, damn. Enterprise, mark. Enterprise! What kind of anomaly? And there's no way to get word to him. According to the security log, this is when T'Pau's biometricsignature was recorded. There must be a stimulant you can inject him with, something tobring him around just for a few minutes."

12657,ENT,episode 81,SOVAL,"Admiral, the High Command will tell you itsdecision at the proper time. The High Command hasn't included me in their discussions. Admiral, I know you find our reluctance to share technology anddiscoveries restrictive. We don't know what to do about humans. Of all the species we'vemade contact with, yours is the only one we can't define. You have thearrogance of Andorians, the stubborn pride of Tellarites. One moment,you're as driven by your emotions as Klingons, and the next, youconfound us by suddenly embracing logic. Not in such confusing abundance. Because there is one species you remind us of. We had our wars, Admiral, just as humans did. Our planet wasdevastated, our civilisation nearly destroyed. Logic saved us. But ittook almost fifteen hundred years for us to rebuild our world andtravel to the stars. You humans did the same in less than a century. There are those on the High Command who wonder what humans wouldachieve in the century to come, and they don't like the answer. Unfortunately, the future of relations between our worlds is notmine to control. Captain Archer, all of Vulcan grieves with you today. They do consider us allies who stand against them. They've been vocal about their opposition to government, butalways peaceful. Your embassy is officially considered to be on Earth soil. We'vepreserved the site for you to investigate. His death is a loss to both our worlds. He saved my life in the explosion. He could have saved himself. The last time we spoke, he was anticipating the prospect ofjoint missions. Humans and Vulcans working together. It makes no sense to think the Syrrannites are responsible forthis outrage. Recheck everything, Captain, question everything, and don't letthem keep you on Enterprise. The answers you need are on Vulcan, andhowever far you have to take this investigation, you have my support. Captain, Commander. This shows the gaps in our satellitesurveillance, when beam-ins can't be detected. Have what, Commander? All I see is a Starfleet data module. He's comatose, brain-damaged, and he's human. A mind-meld isdangerous under the best of conditions, but under these Those who do have the ability won't risk their careers bypublicly attempting what you suggest. Evidence will solve this crime, not mind-melds. You can prove that? You're suggesting a conspiracy. The needs of the many. I can perform the meld. I don't know if this has ever been attemptedwith a human before. My mind to your mind. Our minds are one. Our thoughts arejoined. Yes. I see what you see. The embassy. I'm at my station. At yourstation. So many new people arriving for the summit. I don't recognisethem all, but some I know. A package. That's all right. I don't need tosee it. Go right through. Who are you? Who? No. It was you. I performed it. I'm not a fool, Commander. V'Las was involved with the attack onyour embassy. He's responsible for blaming it on the Syrrannites. It's the only chance I'll have to reach the rest of the HighCommand. Right."
12658,ENT,episode 81,T'POL,"Captain, I've just spoken with Starfleet Command. That's where I prefer to be. My mother hasn't responded to my communiquÃ©s. It's not unusualfor her to become lost in her work. As for my husband, our arrangementremains unchanged. I'd like to introduce Administrator V'Las. You have other suspects? Actually, they're a small group of Vulcans. They follow acorrupted form of Surak's teachings. The Registry records from all Vulcans at birth. Enter. What is the purpose of your visit? Your message was cryptic. You have something to tell me that the authorities shouldn'thear? Why didn't she give this to me herself? My mother? What's important is that she's disappeared like the othersfacing unjustified arrest. No, there's a difference. My mother wants me to find her. It's called an IDIC. It's been modified. This is a desert called the Forge. The route's the one Suraksupposedly followed. Syrrannites follow the same path today, seeking enlightenment. She told Koss this was a family heirloom, but I've never seen itbefore. This site is called Gateway, where Surak supposedly began hisjourney into the Forge. He brought logic to Vulcan, in an age we call the Time ofAwakening, but his writings from that period no longer exist. Over the centuries, his followers made copies of his teachings. You find this amusing? The dampening field only extends a few hundred metres above theground. Patrol craft can fly over it, but their sensors can't see us. We're being stalked. Sehlat. Run. Higher ground. Higher. They won't climb. Days, at least. They're very persistent creatures. When I was achild, I had one as a pet. Domesticated. They were smaller, slightly. You have Porthos. Vulcan children are never late with their sehlat's dinner. T'Pol. That means desert wind. Captain, the reflected heat is too hot for you. I won't need water for several more days. My inner eyelids will protect my vision. My species evolved onthis planet. From the questions he asked you, I believe he is a Syrrannite. And it's obvious that he doesn't trust us enough to take us to theothers. It may be too late for that. Sand-fire! Captain. From my mother. You're a Syrrannite. When did you talk with her? Is she safe? The High Command believes the Syrrannites are responsible forbombing the Earth embassy. Of the IDIC? Surak died on Mount Seleya. Syrrannites claim it's the essence of a Vulcan mind. That it canbe transferred from the body before death, then stored in some manner. Are you injured? Remember. Remember what? The patrol craft are flying again. They sound like they'reclosing in on thislocation. After we bury him. There's nothing there. How do you know? Captain, you're not Vulcan. It's almost dawn. We need to find someplace to hide. That won't help us. What do you mean? To Be Continued... <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

12659,ENT,episode 81,TUCKER,"That's another game. Twenty one to two. Captain, have you seen the reports on thisplace? It's a hellhole. It's got electrical sandstorms. Geomagnetic instabilities sobad, technology won't work. So, no communicators, no scanners, nophase-pistols. We can't even beam you into it. You're going to have towalk in. I'm thinking we're not exactly cleared to have this. Right. Captain, what if something goes wrong down there? You say you found an anomaly. Sure. That's how you tell how old someone is from a cellsample. They used the they sampled when she was registered as ababy. Captain Archer's gone after the wrong person. Doc, take a look at this. It's the recording Malcolm recovered from the embassy. But look, the guard recognised whoever it was. And that guardis your patient. He could be our only chance to identify who really planted thebomb. I don't care about his body, Doc. We need what's in his mind. This man's our only witness. Look, I know Phlox says there aren't a lot of Vulcans who cando this sort of thing, but you've got to know someone who could atleast try. What's that got to do with it? What evidence? The on the bomb was planted. Ambassador, I don't know what kind of pull it takes to messwith records on Vulcan, but I think we're looking at a deliberateattempt to hide the truth. Aren't they worth a little risk? Ambassador. What'd you see? The guard recognised the person who brought in the bomb wefound in the rubble. You're not getting anywhere near him. We accessed his memories through a mind-meld. You can't go back. Then why turn yourself over to him? What if they're all in on it? If you really wanthumans and Vulcans to work together someday, you might start thinkingabout trusting us. Peace and long life, Commander. Right."

Captain's starlog, supplemental. Enterprise hasarrived at Vulcan as ordered. Three days after the bombing of Earth'sembassy, the death toll stands at forty three, and I have lost myfriend, Admiral Forrest. Vulcan authorities still have no lead on who'sresponsible. According to the Vulcan Genome Registry, the on the bomb'scontrols was left by this woman. T'Pau. The Captain asked me to re-examine the DNAfrom the bomb to see if anyone else might have handled it. In these chromosomal fragments. Here, and here. These are telomeres. A genetic clock, if you will. Each time acell divides, they grow shorter. Though T'Pau's current age is thirty two standard years, her DNArecovered from the bomb has an age of only a few months. Precisely. The evidence implicating T'Pau is false. Undoubtedly another fabrication. Corporal Askwith? He's in a coma. His cranial injuries are substantial. I don'texpect him to recover. There's only so much damage a human body can withstand. Most Vulcans see melding as deviant behaviour. I can. One that cost forty three innocent lives. I'm afraid he's in no condition to be questioned. He's in acoma."

12995,ENT,episode 81,V'LAS,"Captain Jonathan Archer, I regret we meet under such tragiccircumstances. To that end, this is Stel, Chief Investigator of our SecurityDirectorate. Even after eighteen hundred years, we consider him the mostimportant Vulcan who ever lived. Captain, I trust you to keep this matter confidential. We don'tshare it lightly. But recently, on our world, there have been instancesof violence against non-Vulcans. Though we have no conclusive proof,there are signs that Syrrannites might be responsible. If evidence is there, the Chief Investigator and I feelconfident you'll find it. Perhaps I could speak with the guard. Yet he provided an eyewitness account. It's not evidence at all! You allowed this distasteful act totake place? Soval. You've shamed Vulcan and yourself. The law leaves me norecourse. You'll be summoned to appear before the High Command toaccount for your actions. Commander. Doctor."
12996,ENT,episode 81,STEL,"Captain, we now have suspects. To create conflict between Earth and Vulcan. Syrrannites. Over the past year their leader, a dissident named Syrran, hasbecome a dangerous zealot. T'Pau is a well-known Syrrannite. Captain, T'Pau is Vulcan. The Security Directorate will takecharge of the investigation. Their assistance isn't required. This is now a Vulcan security operation. We'll inform AmbassadorSoval of any developments that concern you. A witness? The Syrrannite woman, T'Pau. I would like to interrogate this witness myself. Telepathic evidence is inadmissible."
12997,ENT,episode 81,AREV,"Surak. Admiral Maxwell Forrest's Personal Log. I'vearrived on Vulcan, hopeful that the High Command is finally ready toconduct joint missions with Starfleet. The path is safe again. You're a human. Travelling with a Vulcan. Curious. Arev. Does it? Why are you here? I follow the path of Surak in meditation and study. And you? I welcome you to walk with me. But this isno place for your kind. Turn back. This desert's called The Forge for a reason. It will test you anddestroy you. The Plain of Blood. Some say Surak crossed this expanse when thehot blood of battle still flowed green. But with logic, he cooled it. How long have you tried to understand Vulcan logic? Very well, student of Surak. Who said, Logic is the cement of ourcivilisation with which we ascend from chaos using reason as our guide? Something more basic then. What's Kiri-kin-tha's First Law ofMetaphysics? You haven't been truthful about your presence here. Vulcans do not lie. The High Command does not follow Surak's true path. No wonder youhumans are their allies. Over here! Help me with this. The sand-fire can stillreach us. I know this. How did you get this medallion? T'Les. The daughter of T'Les serves on a human starship. You're the human responsible for the destruction of the monasteryat P'Jem. The High Command defiled P'Jem when they used it to spy onAndoria. You exposed their hypocrisy. Your mother is safe with the others, at the T'Kareth sanctuary. It's not far. I'll guide you both there when the storm has passed. A day. Perhaps two. I've never seen one this strong. But we'resafe here, and we're in no hurry. That's not our way. Did your mother tell you the story? Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination. Words that are a mereshadow of its true meaning. Surak tells us that thestory of the has no end. But it begins here, at Mount Seleya. His body, yes, but his katra was spirited away before the lastbattle against those who marched beneath the Raptor's wings. Those whowanted to return to the savage ways. Some say Surak's katra was found, and now is carried by aSyrrannite so all those who meld with him may touch Surak's mind. Surak tells us it is the heritage of every Vulcan. Even those whodon't believe in the practise. At one time, the High Command was onlyresponsible for the exploration of space. But that's changed. I think you've been told many things about us that aren't true. Reseal the entrance! Listen. The storm is gaining strength. You must carry it to Sanctuary. Tuluk to Vokau."

And she looks a hell of a lot like you. You murdered my friend, along with forty other people. It tells me that you're lying! You have a lot to learn about humans. We don't sit back and donothing while our people are attacked. Something like that. No. His name was Arev. He didn't make it. That's what he told us. I'm okay. Right before Arev died, he grabbed me. He put hishand on my forehead. I felt something inside my head. I don't know. But ever since, I haven't been myself. Who are you? That was eighteen hundred years ago. This doesn't feel like adream. Syrran did something to me before he died. You've got the wrong man. He seemed to think I knew who he was. It was Surak. I was near him when he died. I've had my fill of mind-melds. Katric Arks? The Vulcan Science Academy was just as sceptical about timetravel. Not when you put it like that. I'm listening. So I'm suffering from a mind-meld hangover? It feels like more than that. Seeing Surak is only a part of it. I could swear I've been herebefore, in this sanctuary. It's like coming back to the house you grewup in. Let's say you're right, and it was just a mind-meld. He stillput something in my head. And I want it taken out. You know, I'm the one with a Vulcan ghostin his head, depending on who you believe. But I don't feel half as badas you look. At least we know your mother's okay. I don't think these people had anything to do with the embassy. Let's just say it's more than a gut feeling. I can't argue with that. Let's get started. It's my call. Surak. Radiation sickness? But Syrran How long have I been out? I feel like I just pulled my head out of a plasma relay. The Kir'Shara. It was important to Surak, and it's in there. I can find it. T'Klaas. He was a student of Surak, one of the first Kolinahrmasters. We're getting close. It's here. Let'sgo. This way."

13010,ENT,episode 82,SOVAL,"Theanswers you need are on Vulcan, and however far you have to take thisinvestigation, you have my support. No. It was you. V'Las was involved with the attack on your embassy. He's responsiblefor blaming it on the Syrrannites. My actions were taken in the best interest of Vulcan and theHigh Command. Had I revealed my abilities as a melder, my years of servicewould not have been possible. Deception has never been a stranger to this room. One of our own members was responsible for bombing the Earthembassy. An act we tried to blame on the Syrrannites. I find that difficult to accept. I'm aware of the penalty. There's a great deal that needs to be said, Excellency, but noone's willing to listen. Our society rewards merit. V'Las has demonstrated a singulartalent for governing. You're referring to my career? I haven't given it much thought. There's something more important we need to discuss. Have you madecontact with T'Pol or your Captain? V'Las is determined to wipe out the Syrrannites. He'sparticularly intent on destroying their encampment in the Forge. They may be in grave danger. We can trigger a malfunction in thissatellite's imaging node. It'll take six minutes for the centralprocessor to correct the error. Errors occur frequently near the Forge. It shouldn't raisesuspicion. I lived on Earth for more than thirty years, Commander. In thattime, I developed an affinity for your world and its people. Thank you. Enterprise was supposed to leave orbit an hour ago. V'Las is nota patient man. The satellite's been disabled. You've gotsix minutes to get through. They're through. HOSHI; We're losing contact. They must've been monitoring us. I advised them to stay. I gave them the code. None. V'Las will do what whatever it takes to accomplish his goal. He's right. We should withdraw. Our deaths won't help CaptainArcher or T'Pol. I understand we suffered casualties. I share your concern about Captain Archer and T'Pol. The Syrrannites believe violence to be antithetical to Surak'steachings. V'Las considers that a dangerous mindset, particularly now. The High Command is planning to attack Andoria. Vulcan Intelligence claims the Andorians are developing aweapon, possibly based on Xindi technology. I suspect V'Las is using the claim to advance an agenda. He'spersuaded the High Command to launch a preemptive strike. One that could devastate Andoria and Vulcan and eventuallyinvolve other worlds, including Earth."
13011,ENT,episode 82,T'POL,"Thisis a desert called the Forge. The route's the one Surak supposedlyfollowed. Syrrannites claim it's the essence of a Vulcan mind. That it can be transferred from the body before death. The evidence says you did. Mother. We have a great deal to talk about. We met a Syrrannite. He helped us find shelter. He was struck down by an electrical charge. Captain, are you all right? Do you think he was trying to meld with you? I can't understand how you could join these people. And this is where you came for answers? You could have told me all this when I came to visit. I don't want your apologies, Mother. I want you to come backwith me. When you gave me that map, you knew I'd try to find you. That I'd understand? That I'd join you? Extremely. Captain. Captain? Katras are nothing more than a myth. Centuries ago, a set of Katric Arks werediscovered at the P'Jem monastery. Polycrystalline vessels, allegedly used by ancient Vulcans topreserve katras. They were scanned, analyzed. One of the scientistseven attempted to meld with them. They found nothing to indicate thepresence of a katra. Do you really believe you possess the living spirit of Surakinside you? A man who died eighteen hundred years ago? There is a logical explanation. Syrran melded with you before he died. What you're experiencingis the residue of his thoughts. I wouldn't characterise it quite that way, but essentially. You have no basis for comparison. You've never undergone amind-meld before. Syrran spent a great deal of time here. That may not be possible. I'm considering our options. She's joined a violent cult. She's not okay. You sound convinced. You must decline. You'd do this by force? Captain. Captain. His breathing has stabilised, but his fever is still high. If he hadn't, you would have forced him. You claim that Surak'steachings have been corrupted by the High Command, but you're nodifferent. You deceive yourself. I shouldn't have come here looking for you, and I don't wantanything more to do with you. More than three hours. You should rest. What's a Kir'Shara? I'm staying. There's no inscription, nothing to indicate his bloodline. Howdo you know his name? I'm fine. Captain. It's all right. We found the Kir'Shara. I don't understand. Mother. Mother."
13012,ENT,episode 82,TUCKER,"Theguard recognised the person who brought in the bomb we found in therubble. I can't believe they threw you out. Justbecause you helped us? SOVAL; I knew the risks. There's got to be some way you can fight this. SOVAL; I could protest, but it wouldn't accomplish anything. V'Lasisn't one to change his mind. Who the hell put him in charge, anyway? What are you going to do now? We can't reach them and they can't reach us. Where the captain and T'Pol are headed. That should be enough time to slip through the net. Won't theywonder what caused the glitch? Mind if I ask you something? Why are you doing this? I nevergot the impression you cared that much about humans. Seems like youwere always finding something new to complain about. You did a pretty good job of hiding it. Go ahead, Travis.  Just don't tell Malcolm about that part until you're underway. What can we do for you? He's indisposed at the moment. Can I help you? You have a suspect. If it's all the same to you, we'd like to stick around. Excellency. With all respect, we aren't leaving. Not until we know exactlywhat happened. Son of a bitch hung up on us. Admiral Gardner followed the Vulcan linestraight down the middle. He wants us out of here yesterday. I left that part out. There's not a whole lot he can do about it. Hell of a job, Travis. Just find them and bring them back. No sightseeing along theway. We've got a recon satellite to jam. Travis, it's all yours. I guess six minutes wasn't enough. Why the hell did you fire on it? We're looking for our Captain. He's in the Forge, searching for the Syrrannites. We're not leaving without the Captain. Tactical Alert. Polarise hull plating. How many warning shotsdo Vulcans usually fire? We've been over this. Our Captain and First Officer are downthere. You really think he'll do it? Phase-cannons, return fire. Re-route emergency power to phase-cannons. Put him through. Get us the hell out of here. Injuries, two of them serious. They've been in tough jams before. What does the High Command have against the Syrrannites? They went to alot of trouble to frame them for the embassy bombing. So they're pacifists. What do you mean? Wait, wait. Vulcan and Andoria signed a peace treaty two yearsago. Captain Archer helped negotiate it. You don't believe it. He's going to start an interstellar war. Set a course for Andoria. Maximum warp.

I want her released. My daughter wouldn't lie. They're the least of our worries now. You must have questions for me. I've been growing disillusioned with Vulcan society for sometime. When I was forced to resign from the Academy, I began seriouslyto question my beliefs. Syrrannites believe that Vulcans have strayed from the teachingsof Surak. Considering what the High Command has done in recent years,the listening station at P'Jem, the suppression of dissent, ourposition isn't so hard to accept. The High Command was just beginning to hunt down suspectedSyrrannites. I was afraid I would be next. I wanted to keep you out ofit. I know your marriage to Koss was for my sake. To help me regain mypost. I can't do that. I thought that if you could see what we were trying toaccomplish I held out that hope, yes. It's possible I was being foolish. Did you? Syrran possessed the katra of Surak. I used to think that, until I learned to open up my mind toother possibilities. T'Pau? No one here has ever performed this ritual. You'd not only be placing Surak's katra in jeopardy, you couldkill Archer. I doubt Surak would agree. I believe your prejudice toward humans is clouding yourjudgment. Syrran chose to place the katra in Archer. He must have had hisreasons, even if we don't understand them. That may be, but we do have a choice. Now, for the sake ofeveryone involved, I ask you to reconsider. And if Archer dies? It's not without risk. The shock to your nervous system will be severe. It could killyou. How is he? He agreed to the ritual. There is a profound difference. T'Pol. If that's your wish. What do you know about it? If he knows where it is. The High Command knows we're here. We should evacuateimmediately. The Vulcan ships are firing on Enterprise. You can't stay here. T'Pol? I was afraid you were still inside. You have always struggled so with your emotions. I came here, Idid all this to help you. You will. I've always been so proud of you, my T'Pol."

That assessment was correct. Our investigation of Stel hasrevealed he's a Syrrannite. Numerous documents were discovered in his home. The evidence isirrefutable. Syrrannites were responsible, and they'll be dealt withaccordingly. Regarding the matter at hand, your position is terminatedimmediately. You're to surrender all classified materials to theSecurity Directorate before leaving. I remind you that your loyaltyoath is still in effect. A violation of that oath Good. Is there anything else you'd like to say? We've pinpointed their location near thenortheastern border of the Forge. It's based on data collected by search patrols. They've beenconducting missions for several days. We're going to bombard the campwith photonic weapons. Our goal is to maintain order. They've already destroyed an embassy. It's very likely that Syrran himself is inside the compound. With one decisive thrust, we can cripple this insurgency, perhaps endit. We can't let an opportunity like this pass us by. The geomagnetic anomalies make a precision attack impossible. This is the only way. We'll begin preparations immediately. Where is your captain? The investigation of the embassy bombing isnearly complete. The evidence against him and the Syrrannites iscompelling. There's no longer any need for your presence here. We'd prefer you didn't. This is an internalmatter. We'll keep Starfleet apprised if there are any subsequentdevelopments. Again, you have my deepest sympathy for your loss. All of Vulcan grieves withyou. I've also contacted Admiral Gardner. I'm sureyou'll be hearing from him soon. A pleasant journey. Keep monitoring them. We can't proceed with the operation while the Earth ship isthere. Gardner gave them an order to leave. I heard the transmission. They wouldn't disobey an order without a reason. I intend tofind out what it is. Why did you launch a shuttlepod? You had no authorisation. Answer the question. Archer's on the surface? You were ordered to leave orbit. I assume you assisted in disabling the securitysatellite. Commander Tucker, you're to break orbitimmediately. You will leave immediately, or I'll order myships to open fire. I'm running out of patience, Commander. We'll make sure they're returned to you. Breakorbit. Now. Syrrannites must have seen our ships by now. If they evacuateinto the Forge, they'll be extremely hard to track. We can't wait anylonger. Drive Enterprise from orbit. Use all necessary force. You're hopelessly outgunned, weapons are offline, enginesfailing. Don't force me to destroy your ship. The moment Enterprise is beyond scannerrange begin bombardment of the compound. Report. Blanket the area. Comb the desert. Make sure there are no survivors. We are eliminating a threat."

13351,ENT,episode 82,T'PAU,"Who are you? ARCHER; I'm Jonathan Archer. Captain of the Earth vessel. And you must be T'Pol. You are along way from Enterprise. I am T'Pau. I had nothing to do with the destruction of your embassy. I haven't left this desert for two years. What does that tellyou about your evidence? You have a lot to learn about Syrrannites. No, you traverse vast wastelands based on false information. What did you plan to do when you found me, place me under arrest? It seems everything I've heard about your species is accurate. You told them where to find us. Is there anyone else with you? To have crossed the Forge by yourselves, with the sand-firestorms this time of year Who was this person? He's dead? Are you certain his name was Arev? His true name was Syrran. He was our leader. You put us all in danger. What if they'dbeen followed? You could've accomplished that without revealing our location. Not until we've confirmed their story. She's not merely your daughter. She's a member of Starfleet, andStarfleet is allied with the High Command. They'll both remain wherethey are until I'm satisfied they can be trusted. Search patrols areflying day and night. If Syrran is dead, then everything we've worked for is lost. This man, did he tell you his name? We believe you. If Syrran knew he was close to death, he would have tried totransfer the katra to someone else. There is only one way to be certain. I have to meld with you. The prospect doesn't appeal to me, either. I've never meldedwith a human before. Your unchecked emotions will no doubt provedistasteful. However, I ask your indulgence. My mind to your mind. My thoughts to your thoughts. Our mindsare merging. We're in the desert. There's a storm. We find refuge in a cave. Sand-lightning. Our minds are not alone. There's someone else here withus. I sense his presence. He has the katra. I've studied it for some time. I believe I can conduct itsuccessfully. The risks are acceptable. What alternative would you suggest? That we follow this human? You question my logic? The reason is obvious. He was dying. Your daughter couldn'treach him in time. He had to choose Archer. I've made my decision. I'll perform the procedure in one hour. I won't sacrifice our future to protect the life of one human. We've come to a decision. The katra must be removed. There's a procedure, a ritual. It will transfer the katra toanother person. Vulcan neurology is exceptionally resilient, but a human's We're not offering a choice. We'd prefer that you undertake the ritual willingly. It willstand a better chance of success. However, if force is required, wewon't hesitate to use it. Passed down through the ages, the katra of Surak, father of allwe hold true, lives on in this man. Let it now live on in me. I failed. Surak chooses to remain where he is. An artefact. Syrran led us here to find it. Telescopes have sighted three Vulcan cruisers in orbit over theForge. Give the order. We could be next. Take charge of the evacuation. We'll meet youon the Forge as soon as we can. I've spent two years searching for the artefact. If there's achance of finding it. Go. They've begun their assault. I had my doubts whether it really existed. Are you all right? We should keep moving."
13352,ENT,episode 82,KUVAK,"Your accomplishments have been noteworthy. How accurate is this information? Our goal isn't to exterminate these people. They're in the deep desert. What possible harm could they do us? Eventually, they're going to have to leave the Forge, and whenthey do, we can apprehend them with little or no loss of life. A surgical strike could minimize the loss of life. You're concerned about witnesses. So we're now monitoring their communications? Vulcan and Earth have been allies for ahundred years. You're presiding over a massacre."
13353,ENT,episode 82,SURAK,"War is taking its toll. Vulcan is tearing itself apart. You know who I am, Captain. So much death. Hard to believe thiswill become known as the Time of Awakening. You're seeing the past through my eyes. He chose you. You don't trust Vulcans, Captain. And, given yourexperiences with them, I can't say I blame you. The culture you've cometo know isn't the one I helped to create. My people have strayed, andsomeone must restore them to the path. Sorry, Captain. There's an Earth expression, We're stuck witheach other. Don't fight what's been given to you. Open your mind andyour heart and the way will become clear. Good to see you again, Captain. My appearance must be quitedisconcerting. I apologise. We're paying a heavy price for our foolishness. Logic has notwon this day, but this day won't last forever. Logic is at the heart ofevery Vulcan. Even as the ashes fall, my people are discovering a newway. You can accomplish what Syrran could not. Was a Vulcan, and you're human. Which means you are untouched bya culture that can no longer see its own imminent destruction. Wecannot let what happened to the Vulcans of my time take place again. Find what my people have lost.

We've to get this to thecapital. It's too dangerous. We're staying together. It might be the only thing that can stop the war. Between Vulcan and Andoria. V'Las was just stalling for time. He's been preparing alarge-scale attack ever since. Where do you think? Some of Syrran's memories must have been transferred in themeld. You think I've lost my mind? I was chosen for this. If I were in your shoes, I'd be just as sceptical. I'm notpossessed, and I'm not delusional. There are forces at work on yourworld right now, trying to undo everything Surak taught your people. Ifwe fail, Vulcan will be consumed by them. That's why have to get thisthing to the capital. And I'm going to need all three of us to try andfind Just this. Thanks for the warning. Thanks, but I'll be fine. If you need a break, T'Pol, you should say so. Not in a couple of hours. Of all the people who could've carried this katra. Ever since the meld, I've felt more centred. It's hard toexplain. My whole life, I've never really understood Vulcans. Why theywork so hard to suppress their emotions. Now it all seems to makesense. Next thing you know, I'll be taking up meditation. After we get back, maybe you'll want to take a closer look atthe Syrrannites' philosophy. It was important to your mother. There might be something toit. I would've thought you'd be more sympathetic to their cause. You never seemed too happy with the status quo around here. You signed up with Starfleet. A lot of Vulcans I've metconsider us a radical faction. As a scientist, I just thought you mightwant to keep an open mind. I'm not leaving her. What the hell were you doing? To find my science officer. And I don't want to hear anylectures about the needs of the many. I get enough of that crap from,from T'Pol. I'm going to find her. My First Officer, where is she? What have you done with her? I'm still not clear how the Kir'Shara's gonna stop a war. I don't suppose they'll let us just walk into the High Command. I know someone who might have them. We need to have a talk. T'Pau didn't bomb our embassy. You did. Evidence your people gave us. The bombing was an excuse toround up the Syrrannites, make certain they'd never find this. Trip, is everything all right? There've been a few changes here. Get back to Vulcan assoon as you can. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. AdministratorV'Las has been relieved of his position. His role in the embassybombing is being investigated. For the moment, the conflict betweenVulcan and Andoria appears to have been averted. Like a giant weight's been lifted. We're ready."

Have you any idea what the Admiral will do when he finds out? The Vulcans have legitimate reasons for launching this strike. Ifwe alert the Andorians, we will be betraying our closest ally. With all due respect, sir, we shouldn't get involved. Sir? The Ambassador seems to be missing. He's not on board. There's a Vulcan signature on their lead ship. Can we compensate for the flux?

I must speak with Commander Shran. The High Command hasdecrypted your security protocols. We're well aware that your taskforce has been hiding in this nebula. He's in there. That's correct. V'Las has been assembling ships near Regulus, beyond the rangeof your listening stations. They were told you're adapting Xindi weaponry and that you'replanning to use it against Vulcan. That fact was conveniently omitted. You don't. Which is why you must convince them to intercept our fleet. I'm aware of that. The High Command is counting on the element of surprise. If theymeet resistance, I believe V'Las will be forced to call off theinvasion. Soon. Yes. If you're expecting me to plead for mercy, you'll be waiting along time. I've already given it to you. We spent weeks arguing over details in our treaty negotiations. Did I ever mislead you? You must know that torture is rarely effective against Vulcans. Our mental disciplines allow us to suppress pain. I told you. Our ships are assembling near Regulus. Release me! Then I suggest you increase the setting and get this over with. Let me out of here! I'll tear the antennae from your skull! Aren't you enjoying this, Commander? Have you imagined having mein this chair many times? Then trust me now! I'm trying to save them! Do you know the story of Nirak? He was a soldier who lived a long time ago. He was standingwatch over the gates of the city of Gol and he saw a cloud on thehorizon moving toward him. He thought it was a sandstorm, so he told noone. It was an army. They destroyed the city, but they let Nirak live. His name now means fool in our language, just as yours will inAndorian! Ordinarily, I wouldn't, but because of this device You're afraid to injure me. If I were you, I'd leave that detailout of your report to the General. I was a fool to think you'd listen. Perhaps the High Command wasright. We'll be better off when Andoria falls. Are you going to make enemies of the humans as well? How do you feel, Captain?"
13367,ENT,episode 83,T'POL,"Previously, on Enterprise And now the conclusion. We need to get back to Enterprise. Tell Starfleet what we'velearned about the embassy bombing. I don't understand. Enterprise will be scanning for us at thetransport coordinates. One of us should go there. Taking the artefact to the High Command will accomplish nothing. What war? We settled our dispute with the Andorians nearly two years ago. Where did you get this information? Assuming for the moment you possess Surak's katra, he's beendead for centuries. How could he be aware of plans for a war? Captain. I'm not certain your mind is the one making these decisions. Weshould return to the ship. T'Pau can take the artefact to the capital. Chosen? Interesting choice of words. That's the fourth patrol today. There's an extensive securitygrid around the capital. It's unlikely we'll get past it. It's irrelevant what I believe. The Captain could be permanentlyinjured if we don't get him to a doctor soon. It's irrational that we're following someone in his state ofmind. What if he dies before we can get help? I apologise. My mother'sdeath has affected me more than I realised. You melded with her? I cannot meld. That's not what I mean. I was forced to participate in a meldseveral years ago. I was infected with a neural disease. There's no cure. Is there something you can do? Captain, you need to rest. The atmosphere is thinner than you're used to. If you don't stopsoon, you'll collapse. Have you had any more conversations with Surak? Something's amusing? I doubt you were Syrran's first choice. You might find it beneficial. Why? There are many groups who claim to follow the true path ofSurak. I find no evidence that this one's any different. I may have had disagreements with the High Command, but thatdoesn't mean I'm going to join a radical faction. This has nothing to do with science! No. Mount Seleya. Because the artefact contains Surak's original writings. Onlythe priests on Seleya can translate them. I am a Syrrannite. We don't lie. I need to rest. That's a very long time ago. We weren't responsible. You have been misled. Syrrannites are peaceful. I no longer hold that rank. Enter. Captain Archer asked me to expresshis gratitude. He wouldn't have succeeded without your transportercodes. I'm not certain when I'll be able to return. I'm aware that Ipromised your family that we would eventually live together. You don't have to do this. Koss."
13368,ENT,episode 83,TUCKER,"Wecan't reach them, and they can't reach us. He's going to start an interstellar war. Set a course for Andoria. Maximum warp. Anything else? We are going back. We're just taking a small detour first. No. I'll save you a seat at my court-martial. Is there anythingelse? I'm trying to prevent a war, Malcolm. A war that Earth couldget draw into. We're already involved. Come in. That'll be all, Lieutenant. Dismissed. I've been thinking. There's no guarantee the Imperial Guard'sgoing to believe us. We've got no evidence your people are planningthis attack. But there is one Andorian who might trust us. At least hedoes some of the time. Problem is, I have no idea how to find him. Good. Some of the crew are wondering if I'm doing the right thing. Can't say I blame them. I'm not so sure myself. That's what I keep telling myself. To who? Maybe your information's out of date. This is Commander Tucker of Enterprise. We've got someinformation you're going to want to hear. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. I suggest you do it fast. What is it? Tucker to Soval. Ambassador, please respond. Internal sensors. Scan for his biosigns. Scan the Andorian ships. Go to Tactical Alert. Open a channel. This is Commander Tucker. We know Ambassador Soval's aboard your ship. I want to speak with himnow. Target Shran's ship. Disable the engines. It'll take a few hours. You have the Bridge. See if you can get a lock on Soval. You've got a lot of nerve pretending you give a damn. He risked his life coming here, and you paid him back byscrambling his neurons. Now you believe him. What changed your mind? Hoshi? On screen. When will the rest of your fleet get here? Travis, put us between both fleets. If the Vulcans want tostart a war, they're going to have to get through us first. In case you hadn't noticed they outnumber us two to one. I'm trying to buy us some time! This is Commander Tucker. Sorry to spoil your surprise,but the Andorians know what you're planning. I suggest you turn your ships around now. I can't do that. The Andorians helped uswhen Earth was under attack. We're just here to return the favour. I've already sent word to Admiral Gardner. If Enterpriseis destroyed, Starfleet's going to know who is responsible. On us? Stand by phase-cannons. Don't fire until I give the order. Hard about! Get us out of their weapons range! See if you can get their attention. Evasive starboard. Full impulse. Malcolm! Torpedoes! Where the hell is Shran? More or less. What's going on, Captain?"

Your leaders may be fools, but they're not suicidal. They knowwe will respond. That's absurd! Captain Archer destroyed the Xindi prototypebefore we could examine it. You people are so used to lying, you don't even tell the truthto each other. How do I know you weren't sent here as a diversion? Do you have any idea what will happen when the Imperial Guardretaliates? It will be a disaster for both our worlds. You're betraying your own people by telling me this. Why are you doing it? When does this invasion begin? That's the best you can give me, soon? Do you believe him, pinkskin? I'll need to consult with my superiors. This is Shran. You're certain Enterprise won't detect the transport? Energise when ready. Welcome aboard, Ambassador. I simply want to know your fleet's actual location. Then consider this our way of confirming what you've told us. You didn't expect the Imperial Guard to mobilise its entire fleet basedon nothing more than the word of one loyal Vulcan diplomat? No. Our security division has had a great deal of experienceextracting information from Vulcan operatives. This machine doesn'tcause physical discomfort. It uses a neuro-synaptic field to lower youremotional threshold. How do you feel? I've seen Vulcans who were broken by thisdevice. They were never the same again. I have no desire to see thathappen to you. Where is your fleet?! I can't. Not until I'm certain you've told us the truth. I can't. I'm sorry. Not yet. If this interrogation continues, your suppression system couldbe permanently damaged. Tell me what I want to know! That's not far from the truth. But after our rather lengthypeace talks, I came to trust you. You would never betray your people! Where is your fleet?! What? What is it? Tell him I'll contact him when I'm ready. You find this amusing? There are three higher settings on that panel. If I use them Where is your fleet? Report! Lieutenant, order our ships out of the nebula. And tell Enterprise we'll be returning the Ambassador shortly. Get that thing off of him. How is he? I did what was necessary. Soval would understand. He's not the only one taking a risk. I just spoke with theImperial Guard. They're re-deploying our forces. A lesser man would've told me what I wanted to hear, even if itwasn't true. There's been too much suspicion, too many lies, on bothsides. Our fleet will intercept the Vulcans at these coordinates. Mysuperiors believe it may be helpful if Enterprise were to join us. Our sensors show twelve Vulcan cruisersapproaching. They won't arrive in time. We're on our own. Commander, what do you think you're doing? Get back in formation! Tell Archer that's two he owes me."

Make sure there are nosurvivors. The Andorians have deployed most of theirfleet in defensive positions around Paan Mokar. They believe we're preparing to retake it. We've been usingunmanned probes to generate false warp signatures in that system. It's possible that Andorian agents have penetrated the HighCommand. It's necessary to limit access to this information. Our forcesare actually stationed here, preparing to launch an invasion ofAndoria. We know they have the Xindi technology. You've all seen thedata. We received this sensor telemetry two days ago. It was recordedby the Andorian ship that stole the Xindi prototype. Our operatives tell us the prototype was taken back to Andoria, whereit was disassembled. We have reason to believe the Imperial Guard plansto equip their vessels with similar weaponry. They didn't steal the prototype because they were merelycurious. I'm certain of one thing. Sooner or later, the Andorians willmake use of this technology. Is it logical for us to wait for that day? Was Syrran among them? Archer. The Kir'Shara never existed. It doesn't exist! You've been listening to Syrrannitepropaganda. That will be all, Minister. Sublieutenant, order Major Talok to find the remainingSyrrannites. We're dealing with radical insurgents. They're to beeradicated. Do I make myself clear? Welcome home, Subcommander. Well, you may have joined Starfleet, but you're still Vulcan. And subject to our laws. There are few crimes still punishable byexecution, but treason is one of them. What is it? They won't arrive for several hours. Our forces are committed. We can't turn back. This doesn't concern Starfleet. Leave the area immediately. If you side with the Andorians, you'll befired upon. Order our ships to engage the enemyfleet. Sublieutenant. V@LASIf you attemptto interfere again, I'll have you arrested. Destroy them. Contact Security. This woman is an anarchist, Captain. Whatever she's told youisn't the truth. The evidence is conclusive. The Kir'Shara's a myth! Holographic trickery. This proves nothing. No. You can't trust her! She'd do anything to spread her deviantbeliefs. You've spent years trying to subvert me. They'd kill us all if they had the chance! Itmust be destroyed. You've failed. Decades of work have been lost.

Are you in possession of anything metallic? We'll find a way. Surak will help us. You don't believe in thekatra? He doesn't need a physician, he needs a priest. One experiencedwith katras. It was a great loss. We disagreed frequently, but I valued hercounsel. I could allow you to experience what she shared with me. I would initiate it. Pa'nar Syndrome. Do you still suffer from it? Another lie perpetrated by the High Command. Pa'nar has beenknown since Surak's time. It's caused by melders who have beenimproperly trained. One with great experience can correct theneurological imbalance. My mind to your mind. My thoughts to your thoughts. Our mindsare merging. Our minds are one. I'm going to scout ahead. Am I interrupting? Archer! Protecting the Kir'Shara. They're heading east. Away from the capital. She's with them. Where are you going? There's no logic to your plan. We have no weapons. If they takethe Kir'Shara from you, they'll destroy it. Your technique has improved. V'Las can't govern without approval from the Council. Theexistence of the Kir'Shara will persuade them to reconsider theirsupport. We can transport in, but we'll need access codes. Administrator, it is agreeable to see you again. Quantum dating will confirm that it's from the time of Surak. The Kir'Shara will show us our true path. Word has already spread of the discovery. It may take years totranslate all of the writings. You'll no longer have us looking over your shoulder. It's timefor Earth to stand on its own."
13708,ENT,episode 83,KUVAK,"You're presiding over a massacre. We gave them that planet when we signed the treaty. Why wouldthey move their forces there? Why weren't we informed of this? There are members of the Council who are not convinced aninvasion is necessary at this time. Data can be falsified. Do you have evidence of this? Our patrol has returned. They captured eightSyrrannites from the sanctuary. No. He is dead. The Syrrannites say that there were three othersurvivors, including a human. They say that he is carrying the Kir'Shara. There are scholars who believe it does, and that it was hiddenin the Forge. The Syrrannites claim that they are following the truepath of Surak. If the Kir'Shara is real, it could prove them right. Seven alien ships have taken position outside the Andoriansystem. They are directly in the path of our fleet. The Andorians have more ships on the way. You told us this strike would be a surprise. That there would beminimal casualties on both sides. The Andorians are armed with standardparticle cannons. There is no evidence of Xindi technology. Administrator, we have to call off this attack. Administrator, I can't allow this. Stay where you are. Is that? The artefact must be examined in detail. This is Minister Kuvak. Get me the Fleet Commander immediately.

13713,ENT,episode 84,ARCHER,"You haven't stopped talking about this for a week. Did I ever tell you about meeting Zefram Cochrane? Then you know I understand how you feel. You want a mirror? Hello, Emory. Good to see you. My Chief Engineer, Commander Charles Tucker. Danica. Trip. As long as you return it in good condition. Sounds like you're trying to put me out of a job. Captain's Log, supplemental Maybe you will put me out of a job. I remember you and my father having similar discussions. I have to confess, given a choice, I'd much rather use a goodold-fashioned shuttlepod. You know the ship like a member of the crew. Still wonder why you haven't signed on. Your father seems like he can take care of himself. He surehasn't lost any of his edge. So, why are you still on Earth? It's been fourteen years. He lost a son. If you leave, he'll lose a daughter. And if the test doesn't go well? We both grew up with fathers who could be pretty demanding. Maybe you should start thinking more aboutyourself. I know. It's hard taking advice from someone who used tochase you around the backyard with a plastic laser pistol. Can you pinpoint it? The lights were malfunctioning. It showed up at the same time, in the same location. Can't havebeen a coincidence. Something out here killed one of my crewmen. What is it? Of course. Looks like it arrived in good condition. We're already getting back data. Congratulations, Emory. Come in. What are you saying? Yeah. Maybe he needs the power for another phase of the experiment. When I asked Emory about the anomaly that killed Burrows, heclaimed he'd never heard of anything like it. Something very similar appeared on Emory's research ship fiveyears ago. T'Pol dug up the report from Starfleet's data banks. A crewmember saw it. Said it seemed to be alive. Go ahead. On my way. What's your best guess? Take section three. Take section four. Don't letit touch you. Can you slow it down? Holdit. Enhance. A little more. It's Quinn. Emory's son. Emory? What are you talking about? You let him go through with the test? I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about Quinn. You said you came here to get him back? You could've told me all of this before. A member of my crew is dead. You want me to believe you? You were like my second father. You should've trusted me. Is that the truth? You've been lying to me since you came aboard. I want you both to work with Emory, givehim whatever help he needs. What is it, Trip? It won't happen again. We'll alert the crew to the danger. I know there's a risk. We're talking one more day. That's allEmory needs. I believe him. That's not why I'm doing this. Quinn's signal is getting weaker, Trip. It's been decaying forthe past fifteen years. Emory says if we don't do something now, we'llnever get him back in one piece. We have a responsibility to help. I'm aware of that. But we're here. We can't just turn the shiparound and leave a man to die. You have your orders. I suggest you getstarted. And an appetite to match. We can't change what's happened. Maybe some good can come outof it. Let's hope when this is over, you'll have something else tothink about. Archer. Keep monitoring. Will it affect the transporter? We're not going to have this argument again. If we beam Quinn aboard there won't be any more of thesemanifestations. Trip. And you are this close to insubordination. I've made a decision. It's the right decision, and thediscussion is over. Can you accept that? Now go do your job. When will that be? We're ready. Forget it. Let's make it worthwhile. Let's get Quinn back. I don't blame you. On the day before I entered flight training, I asked my fatherpretty much the same thing. Don't fail. He didn't need to be. T'Pol. Go ahead. Emory, Emory, you can't save him. If it means anything, my guess is Quinn would feel the sameway. I've been in contact with Starfleet. I'm sure they'll take your achievements into consideration. I always thought she should be out here.Â EMORY You'd probably be good at it. Safe journey. Good luck."

I don't feel anything about it. It's the truth. Trip, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's notnecessary. The Vulcan Science Academy has been studying sub-quantumtransporting for some time, with little result. It could be a form of spatial distortion. F Deck. Near the Armoury. He suffered massive cellular disruption, asif he'd been subjected to intense delta radiation. You've spent a great deal of time in this region of space. Are you sure? The probe materialised at the targetcoordinates. Captain, we're receiving telemetry. Bridge to Captain Archer. We're picking up another one. It's on C deck, section five. It's fluctuating. I've lost it. This way. It should be here. It's highly unstable, surrounded by a subspace field. I took visual readings. We don't fully understand the nature of these manifestations. They could pose other dangers. What he claims he needs. Because he's a friend of the family? The power conversion tables. Some of thesemodifications should help. Is there anything else? Movie night? I don't think I'll have the time for either. Kir'Shara. Eventually. I may have found new priorities. I'm needed on the Bridge. T'Pol to Captain Archer. I picked up something that was in your area,but I've lost it. Nothing. Captain. B deck, section eight. It's still difficult for me to accept. The Kir'Shara is having an enormous impact. I've never felt less certain. Do you have a moment? I'm going through something that's very complicated. I'm learning, it seems for the first time what it truly means tobe Vulcan. Not until I understand it myself. I don't think there'll be timefor That you understand."
13725,ENT,episode 84,TUCKER,"I admit it. I've got a few butterflies. Okay, more than a few. Well, it's different for you. You grew up with the man. When Iwas seven, my mom bought me a book about him. Emory Erickson, Father ofthe Transporter. I made her read it to me every night for a month. Thatbook is the reason I became an engineer. Yeah, only about fifty times. You've got a mean streak in you, you know that? It's an honour. I'm looking forward to it. Feel like some company? We haven't talkedmuch since Vulcan. How are you holding up? I've been seeing you by yourself a lot. How is it? Interesting? Look, I know what you're going through. Losing a family member,it's the toughest thing there is. Your mother died a week ago. It may change the way you feel about it. You can tell yourself that, You know, when Lizzie died, there were times I wanted to justclose up, retreat inside myself, You're fine? Well, if you ever do want to talk, let me know. I'll see you. That's over sixteen light years. It's hard to imagine. Beaming someone that far. Which would make all of us copies. Here's to a successful experiment. Captain's Log, supplemental. We're entering an areaknown as the Barrens. There's not a star system within a hundred lightyears. Perfect conditions for Emory's test. Is it true you're the first person to go through? You must've been scared. Well, you're going to need more juice than I thought. Well, we'll have to draw direct from the warp reactor. May evenhave to shut down a few systems. Yeah. if I could get a look at your power converter, it mighthelp me out. Well, thanks, but when it comes to modifying our systems, Iprefer to do things myself. Can I get a look at it? And I said, no, thanks. Routing power. Ready. Sir? Forty thousand kilometres. Nothings ever gone that far. It's going to take a few hours to gather all the telemetry. Let's celebrate in Mess Hall. My treat. Well, then let me bring something back for you. Help pass thetime between data streams. It's been a long day. You must be starving. You sure you don't want a second pair of eyes? You know where to find me. Something's wrong. Most of the work Emory had me do, tappinginto the warp reactor for extra power, re-routing the plasma flow. Itwasn't necessary for the test. Remember when the lights dimmed? Well, he channeled that energy into a feedback loop. It wasn'tgoing into the beam. Well, from what I can tell, his sub-quantum version should useless energy than a regular transporter. That's one of the reasons it'sso brilliant. Either he was keeping me busy, making sure I was lookingthe other way, or this sub-quantum thing is a smoke screen forsomething else. Something he hasn't told us about. I wouldn't havepicked up on any of it if you hadn't asked me to take a closer look. Not true? Who is it? I can't believe I'm hearing this. We've already lost one man. If they'd been alerted twenty four hours ago, Burrows might bealive. Why are you doing this? What about Emory's responsibility? He lied to get us out here. We're still getting a spike in the array. Icould swap out the emitter coils with something from Engineering. Mighteven out a bit. I'll get on it. You need my approval? You liked me better when I worshipped your shadow? I'd think you'd be out of practice. I have lost someone close, and I'd do almost anything to gether back. Except put other people in danger. I'll be in Engineering. Thanks. No, I think we're pretty much there. I'mtrying to decide what to show for movie night. Yeah, I thought I'd fire up the old tradition. You in the moodfor a horror film or a musical? You can't spend every second of your life studying that,whatever it's called. You got to take a break eventually. I don't get you, T'Pol. I thought you joined Starfleet so youcould interact a little more with humans. But it seems to me that eversince we left spacedock, you spend all your free time cooped up in yourroom reading that bible of yours. What's that supposed to mean? It knocked out an junction. Repair'sgoing to take a couple of hours. No. I can't believe you're still going through with this. That thing barely missed a stack of torpedoes. If it had jumpedtwo feet to the left we wouldn't be here to talk about it. We shouldconcentrate on repairing the ship so we can get out of here. How the hell do you know? You're putting your personal feelings before the safety of thisship. Insubordination? Yes, sir. Way ahead of you. Got a lock on something. Pattern's good That's all we got. I don't have a strong enough signal. That won't help get us a lock. The transporter can't do that. There's not enough time. Sure. Something tells me you're not here to talk about movienight. I know. Well, maybe you can fill me in. What do you want me to say? I do. It's not like I didn't know this was coming. At least my warp engines still need me. Captain's log, supplemental. We've rendezvousedwith the Sarajevo, which will be returning Emory and Danica to Earth. I'll check it out."

14068,ENT,episode 84,EMORY,"Nothing seems to be missing, Jonathan, look at you. I always suspected you'd be famous, justdidn't think that you'd be more famous than me. Do it later. I want a tour of this place. Guess you and I'll be spending some time together. I hope you don't mind that I'm borrowing your ship, Captain. Don't know if I can promise that. When this test is over,Enterprise and all of Starfleet could be obsolete. Sub-quantum teleportation. You step on to a transporter onEarth, a few seconds later, you're on Vulcan. That's just for starters. Theoretically, there's no limit to thedistance. One of the things we're here to test. You tell me, with thatkind of technology who'd have any use for a starship? Well, I wouldn't worry too much. It's going to take decades towork out all the bugs. But when we do, Starfleet's gonna look a hell ofa lot different. That's if it exists at all. He believed the future was in the warp drive, I believed in thetransporter pad. I miss those talks. I miss him. To Henry, I've been trying to get my hands on some of that research foryears. In hindsight, it's probably just as well that I couldn't. Might've sent me down the wrong path. All breakthroughs are hard to imagine before they happen. When Ideveloped the transporter, most people simply couldn't grasp it. Somestill can't. I'll never forget the protests when the transporter was firstapproved for bio-matter. People said it was unsafe, that it caused brain cancer,psychosis, and even sleep disorders. And then there was all thatmetaphysical chatter about whether or not the person who arrived afterthe transport was the same person who left, and not some weird copy. I had to fight all of that nonsense, and I'm not going to tellyou there weren't costs. I'm living proof of that, but I won. Mankindis better off. Makes everything I've fought for worthwhile. Those early days were pretty terrifying. I'm lucky to be alive. I wasn't about to let anyone else do it. Terrified. That original transporter took a full minute and ahalf to cycle through. Felt like a year. You could actually feelyourself being taken apart and put back together. When I materialised,first thing I did was lose my lunch. Second thing I did was get stonedrunk. Trick I learned from Zefram Cochrane. Now there was a man whoknew the benefits of a little liquid courage. What is it? Not more than Enterprise can spare. You'll be able to leave the lights on. I'll tell you what. When I'm done with this, I'll install theconverter. See if I can't make life easier on you. I said I'd install the converter. I wish I had time to debate the finer points of engineeringprotocol, but as you can see I'm extremely busy. And I realise this isyour ship and I'm only a guest, but let me remind you that Starfleethas granted me complete access to your systems. If you hadn't noticed,I'm more than capable of handling a little power upgrade. Hand me that,will you? How was your tour? I can always tell when you're upset. You do this like you're ina hurry. We're here. That's reason enough to be optimistic. We have no choice. No. He wouldn't understand. We can't say anything to him. Wecan't trust anyone. He's a Starfleet captain. His first duty is to his ship. He's not an enemy. But he's not on our side, either. Believe me. This anomaly you detected, you think it was somehow responsible? I sympathise, believe me. During the initial tests for thetransporter, some brave men and women were lost. Not a day goes by thatI don't think about them. How can I help? I never encountered anything like this. There's a reason this is called the Barrens, Captain. There'snothing out here. I wish I had an explanation for you. Time for my treatment. Dani? Sorry. Canwe continue this later? Calm down. I didn't know this would happen. Listen to me, Dani, you're condemning him to death. He's alive. I know. I know that. We're almost ready for our first test. The odds of that happening again are extremely small. No one'sgoing to die. I just need a couple of days. We owe him that much, Dani. When we're done, you can ask him. Help me up. Give me a hand, please. This part I like doing myself. Energising. It's a start. I like to monitor the data as it comes in. I'm sort of obsessivethat way. No, thanks. You go ahead. I'll join you later. One pair will do. And no offence, Commander, but I work muchbetter when I'm not being distracted. That's incredible. He hasn't aged a day. I'm not here to test a new transporter. I'm here to bring backmy son. We were conducting first trials. My greatest achievement. Quinnwanted to be the first to go through. He was a lot like his old man. Alot like you. I lost his signal and couldn't get it back. Truth is, thesub-quantum transporter is a fundamentally flawed concept. It'll neverwork. Not now, not a thousand years from now. I suppose I knew that atthe time. I was a relatively young man who had created something thatchanged Starfleet. After an achievement of that magnitude, there wasnowhere to go but down. My life became just one long struggle torecapture past glory. I wasn't thinking of the consequences. This region, the Barrens, is actually a subspace node, a bubbleof curved space-time. It's why there are no stars. Quinn's transportersignal is trapped here. At certain intervals, there are fluctuations inthe node that cause the signal to reappear. If we can lock onto it atone of those intervals we can save him. Starfleet would never have authorised the mission. I had tocreate an excuse. I didn't know that the manifestations would be dangerous,believe me. I want you to help me. Quinn was like a brother to you. All I need is one more scan. I can bring him back. I'm not lying. I had no choice! I'm sorry. Please help me, Jonathan. Help mesave my son. Please. Sounds good. I know you don't approve of what I've done. I'm disappointed that you think less of me. Yes. It's an honest answer. You may want to reserve judgment on my actions until you've losta son. Quinn and I used to argue all the time. Wasn't until I lost himthat I realised that those arguments were some of the happiest momentsof my life. I think that it's possible. That's enough reason for me to try. He's here. Jonathan. There. Quinn? Quinn? I got what I needed. You should be able toget a good lock when he reappears. Just over three hours. How's your ship? You saved my life You didn't deserve any of this, Jonathan. I'm sorry this becameyour problem. I'm scared. I've waited so long for this moment. Planned for it. What ifsomething goes wrong? What if I fail? What did he say? Henry never was a poet. Any moment now. Confinement beam. Widest possible spread. Let me. Energising. We need more power. It's working. No. No. Complete thetransport sequence. Recalibrate the confinement beam. Just do it. That's not possible. I can reverse the damage by cross-phasing the stream. I built the damn thing! Get away from me. Tie in the secondary buffers. I can hold the pattern. Just do it! No! I can't let him go. I can't! I'm sorry, Quinn. Oh, Quinn. Quinn, please forgive me, please. Come in. I couldn't leavehim like that. It's better to be alive or dead, not somewhere inbetween. I came here to bring my son home. I suppose I accomplished mygoal. I imagine they're not too happy with all of this. I perpetrated a fraud to obtain the use of your ship. A memberof your crew is dead. There's no way I'm going to avoid theconsequences. There's one good thing to come out of this. Dani won'thave to worry about taking care of me anymore. I managed to let go ofone of my children. Now I guess it's time for me to let go of the otherone. I wouldn't be boring. Why settle for making myself miserablewhen I can spread the misery around to an entire class of students? And you, Jonathan. Commander. An honour working withyou. Some suggestions. This might boost your transporter range a fewhundred kilometres. Couldn't resist."
14069,ENT,episode 84,QUINN,Dad? What's wrong? What is it? What?
14070,ENT,episode 84,BURROWS,It's from over there.
14071,ENT,episode 84,DANICA,"Jon. Oh, we have a lot of catching up to do. Dad, You can see he hasn't changed. Oh, God. Here we go. That's the main reactor and those are theplasma feeds, right? I've read just about everything I could find on her. I probablycould describe every one of your missions. I think you know the answer. Can't argue with that. He needs me. He still hasn't gotten over Quinn. Fifteen. If this test goes well, it'll be a new start for him. Give himsomething to look forward to. He won't spend all of his time thinkingabout the past. I don't know. That's an understatement. Yeah, but it's good advice, Jonathan. I just wish I couldfollow it. I enjoyed it. Don't you think there's something to be upset about? We're lying to them. We could talk to Jon. He might be able to help us. It's Jon. You talk about him like he's an enemy. Did other crewmen see anything? You never said that anything like this would happen. Dad, a man is dead, and we're responsible. I'm not going to goalong with this anymore. No, no. We've got to tell them the truth! I'm condemning him? How do you know he isn't already dead? Dad, Jonathan's practically family. He and Quinn were bestfriends. We can't do this to him, to his crew. Someone else could die before then. I wonder what he would have to say about all this. About whatwe're doing. Can I come in? Hey there. You must bePorthos. I've heard a lot about you. He's got alot of personality. I wanted to say that I'm sorry. I should've come to youearlier. I feel responsible. You lost a crewman. You think we can get him back? I wonder what it must be like for him, you know? Is he in pain? Is he conscious? If he is, does he think that we've forgotten abouthim? Quinn was everything to my father. To both of us. Getting him backis all that we've thought about for the past fifteen years. Quinn. Dad. Dad, let him go. Say good-bye to Porthos. Maybe I'll see you around. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

14074,ENT,episode 85,ARCHER,"Welcome back. How did your treasure hunt turn out? Can you bring the shuttlepod in? Slow and steady, Ensign. I'll see you inDecon. Call Phlox. Trip, how you feeling? We need to check out the shuttlepod, too. See if any of itsenvironmental systems were at fault. Stay where you are, Trip. Phlox needs blood samples. Hoshi, what is it? Anything? Doesn't sound good. This is an M class planet. All life forms down there should becarbon-based. Is there a treatment? Then it's up to you. It's me. You're usually too stubborn to be talked out of anything. ButI'll do my best. How's Hoshi? Phlox identified what's causing all the trouble. Asilicon-based virus. He's working on it. So is T'Pol. Not yet. If you mean how much time do you have, it's too early for thatkind of talk. Your own immune system could knock this thing out. Don't you give up on me. Get some rest. There. If Phlox is right about the viruscoming here on a meteorite, that crater might be the source of it. Which means the Klingons at this campsite must have been infected, too. Set up a priority channel to Starfleet Command. We need to find outwhich Klingon ship explored this world, and whether or not theydeveloped a cure. I've heard from Starfleet. They're working through diplomaticchannels to contact the Klingons, but it might not be necessary. Thisspectrograph identifies a Klingon alloy. I found it here. It's what's left of a Klingon shuttlecraft. Their response toan infected landing party. The Commander killed his own shuttle crew. At least we know we don't have to bother asking them if theyhave a cure. On bended knee. Shut down all power to D deck. I want those doors sealed. We can't risk Hoshi wandering off again. Especially since itseems she can override every security safeguard on Enterprise. It's your turn, Trip. Sorry, Trip. How close are you to stopping this? Sounds promising. There's got to be some kind of a trade-off. A way to produceenough radiation to slow down the virus without killing the patient. Work faster. What is the significance? He must have used Denobulan technology. We had nothing to do with it. It's been so long since we had physical form, we weren't ableto distinguish sleep from sedation. Memories are simple to adjust. We could. According to what I read on the Doctor'smedical PADD, he's learned how to stop the infection. Did we make First Contact with any of them? That won't be a problem. We're going to make this work. Engaging quarantine. Entering the quarantine zone. She's stopped breathing. Hoshi. Phlox! What are you doing?! I'll be your hands. Right now, Enterprise needs a doctor more than it needs aCaptain. Come on, Hoshi. Again! Not your fault, Doctor. You should continue your work on the Bridge. Less chance ofsomething going wrong with your suit. You know where to find me. Archer to T'Pol. I take it you've been watching. Then you know you're in command? I would like to think you'll stay in command. Don't let Admiral Gardner sneak in someone over your head. I know you will. I need to look after Trip now. We'll talk again. We'll talk again. I'll let you know right away. Archer out. Trip? What did you do to him? Did you know about the silicon virus? You knew about the virus that killed two members of my crew,and you didn't warn us? I don't care about your rules. Tell me what happens to Trip andHoshi when you're finished with their bodies. Dead? I understand why you won't get involved with a species'natural development. I've faced that decision myself. It isn't an easyone to make. No, we don't. Our encounter with the virus was an accident. onethat you could have prevented. Ask us. Talk to us. Just like you're doing now. Not from where I'm standing. Maybe you've evolved into beingswith abilities I can't comprehend, but you've paid a hell of a price. You've lost compassion and empathy. Things that give life meaning. Andif that's what it takes to be advanced, I don't want any part of it. There's another way. Experience compassion for yourself. Youwant to know what it means to be human, you need to do more thanobserve. Archer to the Bridge. You wanted to know when Trip was awake. Well, you'd better get down here because he's talking up astorm, and so is Hoshi. You too, Phlox. Maybe one of you can tell me what the helljust happened. I'm sure someone at Starfleet Medical will figure it out. Butfor now, we're going to leave a warning beacon in orbit here and makesure what happened to us never happens to anyone again."

14082,ENT,episode 85,REED,"You're really starting to get a feel for the game. Ten to the one hundred twenty third power. Their average life span's only about a hundred years. With no time toplay all the possible games. Careful. No emotional involvement. I'm the ship's champion. I win all the tournaments. Well, that's what we're here to find out, but in my experience,all physical species are alike. I don't expect humans will be anydifferent. It's possible. For some of the species that have come here, I'veseen the whole crew die. For others, only a few. Always. Your move. I feel like I'm still breathingdirt. Shuttlepod One to Enterprise. Their response was typical for a species at their level ofdevelopment. Your point? Captain Archer's done nothing different from the Klingons. Thelaunch bay and Decon Chamber are completely isolated from the rest ofthe ship. Precisely. Humans don't want to interact with dying crew matesany more than Klingons did. If it was left to me, I'd stop ourobservations immediately. We have nothing more to learn from humans. Ah, but in the end they killed their infected crew, just as theKlingons did. The only difference is the time it took to reach thatdecision. I've been observing aliens for eight hundred years. I've yet tobe surprised. Still, we should follow protocol. Start questioning theinfected crew. I'll check in with the Doctor. Headache. Are these are the blood tests for Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato? No, not yet. Although it feels like it could get worse. Preventive measure. A lot to do today. Doctor, I'm curious to know how you think these tests will helpyou develop an effective treatment. I mean, are you approaching this strictly on a symptomatic level,or do you believe there's any similarity to other conditions you'veseen in the past? I'm not worried about that, no. I'm interested in the methodologyPHLOX That happens thirty seven percent of the time. Then this'll likely be one of the times when everyone dies. Rational intelligence, yes. Which Archer has not demonstrated. The longer the infected crew remain on board, the greater the risk thatquarantine will fail. It's just as probable that he hasn't realised how hopeless thesituation is. We chose the Helmsman and the Armory Officer for good reason. They're both stationed on the Bridge, yet neither plays a critical rolein a medical emergency. The more people we inhabit, the greater the chance that we willinadvertently interfere. Right away, sir. That's the signature of standard hull plating. They didn't even plead for mercy. I mean, they wouldn't, wouldthey? Being Klingon. Quarantine breach on D deck. The DeconChamber has been unsealed. Someone's overriding the safety interlocks. That's not why we're here. This is not the place to be having this discussion. Reed to Bridge. I confirm a positive seal. Someone always dies. I don't understand. No. Not once they know it's hopeless. I will not depart from protocol. The incident isn't over. Whenthe first death occurs on the ship, there's a sixty eight percentchance the rest of the crew will become infected. All this would have happened whether we were here or not. We arenot responsible. You realise the consequences of what we'vedone. We will never be able to observe another species encounter thisvirus. These humans have not been a good influenceon you. I would not encourage further encounters. Indeed. At the rate they're progressing, that'd barely give usfive thousand years to prepare."

14085,ENT,episode 85,T'POL,"We're waiting on new test results. Of course. We're going there now. Their courage isn't at question. Their intelligence is. This isn't a competition. Either a species' intelligence isdeveloped enough for First Contact, or it isn't. This is the measure we have used for ten thousand years. It'snot our responsibility to change it. We should leave these creatures to their work undisturbed. This could indicate the virus is sensitive to ionizingradiation. I'll prepare new samples for testing. Did you know they had this capability? We come here only to study how physical species react to theunknown. You can help by telling us how you detected our presence. Thathappens in less than two percent of our missions. We'll remember next time. We're here to observe. We can't interfere. Our subjects are human. You're Denobulan. You were inhabited afew hours ago. An intriguing experience. Or what you observed in the Decon Chamber. But we won't. Thank you for your help, Doctor. I've seen seven other species develop the radiation cure. Butnever in time. Of course not. Expending resources to attempt an impossible taskis not a sign of intelligence. The Captain and Science Officer havedecisions to make. We need to return to our original hosts. To move them from Decon to Sickbay, we'll need to expand thequarantined area. Environmental systems are isolated. T'Pol here, Captain. I have. Yes, Captain. I'll do my best. Captain, if Commander Tucker becomesconscious. T'Pol. Go ahead. Yes. Obviously, the pathogen's behaviour is more unpredictable thanwe assumed."
14086,ENT,episode 85,TUCKER,"Well, nothing worth bringing home. The Klingons must've beenhere years ago. All they left was an old power cell and a bunch ofempty ration packs. Yeah. A long hot shower's looking pretty good. Shuttlepod Oneout. Take over. Got to dock. Like I've been gut-punched by a Tellarite. I can do that, Captain. I should've thought of that myself. I'm going to guess that's a yes. Okay, this is for nausea, muscle pain, and a cough suppressant. Well, Doctor's orders We're a little busy right now, Travis. Yeah. Phlox doesn't know what's wrong with us yet. Aren't you supposed to be on duty? Travis, we really need to get some sleep. Thanks for stopping by. You ever see The Andromeda Strain? No, it's a movie. Mid-twentieth century. It's about an extraterrestrial disease. This reminds me of my dorm room at Starfleet Training. Got intoa lot of trouble at old STC. Well, you can't stop there. Can I ask why? You broke his arm playing cards? Hold on. You ran a floating poker game at STC? What happened? How the hell did you end up on Enterprise? Travis, if that's you again. Next time I ask to go on a landing party, talk me out of it,okay? Sleeping. Whatever Phlox gave us, at least it's helping withthe pain. I don't suppose he's on his way over here with the cure. So, there is no cure. I'm getting the idea you're up against a deadline. I remember Exobiology 101, Captain. Humans are carbon-based. Our immune system can't fight silicon. There are still a bunch of planets out there we haven't seen. How many languages can you speak? Good? You're a genius. The way you can pick up an alienlanguage you've never heard before and start spouting it back to them? I got to tell you, I've always been jealous you can do that. It's a bit more complicated than that. Sometimes. When I was a kid, not so good at building. But I was a terrorwhen it came to taking things apart. My folks used to put all ourkitchen appliances on the highest shelves. One Thanksgiving, Ihave no idea what I was thinking, but I removed every screw from thisbig dining room table we had. It was so old, the wood sort of stucktogether, so it stayed standing until my dad put the turkey down. Ispent the next month in my room. Oh, twenty four, twenty five. How long have they been there? How's the research coming? You're the ones with the medical scanners. Look, if you really want to know how we feel, we'd be a lotbetter knowing you two were back in Sickbay working on the cure forthis. Yeah, unless there's nothing more they can do. Hoshi. Hoshi, wake up. That's where we are. You'll see them again. Archer is pacing when Travis and Reed join him.) Hoshi, we're in quarantine for a reason. I have no idea what you're saying, but you can't break thelockout code. Hoshi, you have to stop. That's an airlock. You open thosedoors, we die. Hoshi, come on. The Captain won't let us down. Trip to whoever's out there. We're back. That could drop a horse. Yeah, she's full of surprises today. Sweet dreams, Houdini. Anything else? Come on, Captain. You think I'm going to wander off, too? Startopening the wrong doors? I'm just wondering if either one of us willever wake up again. I won't argue with that. The sensations in this host are different from the others. I'mexperiencing physical pain. Why should any species have to endure this weakness? Maybe that isn't true for all species. Well, what worked for us might not work foreveryone. Humans have different qualities. What do you have against this species? Klingons embrace violence. The humans tryto avoid it. I have such respect for you, Captain Archer. Not exactly. I'm an Organian. a nonphysical life-form. Trip is my host. Nothing. We never interfere in the natural development of otherspecies. We only observe. That's why we come here. To see how different species reactwhen they encounter it. I wanted to, but it's not up to me. Because they don't apply to this species. If we don't challenge the rules No. We have the power to save them all. I'm defying the entire protocol. What Archer has done today,his act of compassion, you've never witnessed that before."

Are you feeling any other symptoms? I'll prepare anti-nausea medication. You get me those bloodsamples as soon as you can. Whatever's afflicting them, it's not showing up on the standardscans. It's not. Lieutenant Reed. Something I can do for you? Of course. Just a moment. That's correct. I'm not detecting any vascular involvement. Your headache. Not a bad one, I take it? Mild analgesic it is. So am I. Lieutenant, I believe I can put your mind at ease. If yourcolleagues have returned with a contagious illness, there is no way itcan spread to the rest of the ship. We are all quite safe. The closest classification it matches is avirus. Highly contagious. Silicon-based. I can only surmise the virus was brought here. Perhaps by ameteorite, which could explain why only one of our landing partiesencountered it. There's no record of anything like it in the Denobulan database. I'll do all I can, Captain, but at the rate the pathogen isreproducing, Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato have less than five hoursto live. We didn't want to interrupt you. We thought we'd see how you two were progressing. We were more interested in discussing your state of mind. Commander. Ensign. They're very brave, the way they're facingdeath. You want the humans to fail. Perhaps we should consider other qualities in making ourdecision. Then whose responsibility is it? Those are the new test results my host iswaiting for. The Helmsman and the Armoury Officer are back on the Bridge. The altered immune receptors weren't effective. At levels that would be fatal to humans, but it's a start. Commander, I want you to set your hyposprayfor three units of sonambutril. Commander, the virus is incompatible with carbon-based life. It's attacking your bodies in ways I can't predict. Not if you're sedated. Commander. You should lie down right away. T'Pol and I have isolated a specific frequency of radiation thatdisrupts the silicon matrix of the virus. Unfortunately, the dosage required would be lethal. That's what I'm working on. You can't be awake. Not with that much sonambutril. Extraordinary. Captain, T'Pol. I was just coming to see you. These arebrainwave readings of Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato. The patterns aren't human. I see. Are you responsible for what happened to my patients? Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato were sedated. They shouldn'thave been able to stand and talk. Is there anything you can do to help my patients? You're interfering with me! I have no recollection of that. You're going to adjust mine again? So I won't remember a word ofthis encounter. If you have that ability, you must be able to help my patients. No wonder you erase memories. Your behaviour is appalling. For the radiation to destroy the viruswithout killing the patient, it must be precisely focused. The emittersin the Decon Chamber aren't suitable, but the bio-scanner in Sickbayis. Ensign Sato's condition is deteriorating. We need to hurry. She's going into oligemic shock. Captain,she's dying. Get her on the bioscan bed. This equipment's not designed for EV gloves. No, Captain, no! Attach the leads twenty centimetres apart. You need to inject Forty units of trinephedrine into her heart. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That can't go deep enough. Old-fashioned, but effective. Angle it slightly more to theright. Now, in one quick motion, insert it three centimetres. Press the activator. Clear. Three hundred millijoules. Captain. Three hundred and forty. She's gone. Captain, help me withCommander Tucker. We need to move him into the scanner. It didn't work. I'm sorry, Captain. There's nothing more I can do for Commander Tucker, but you'vestill got a few hours. There has to be something else I can try. I won't give up. Captain, Hoshi's You're all completely free of the virus. Ithas to have been a delayed reaction to Commander Tucker's radiationtreatment, but how it spilled over to you and Hoshi, I have noexplanation."

14096,ENT,episode 85,HOSHI,"And a latrine. Commander? What's wrong?! Shuttlepod One to Enterprise. I have a medical emergency. CommanderTucker's collapsed. Yes, sir. At least in simulations. Understood. Doctor, should we start with the bio-gel? Before Commander Tucker passed out, he started coughing. I'm not coughing anymore. Neither are you. Maybe we're gettingbetter. Something for our symptoms. Strain of what? Let me guess. Doctor Andromeda builds a monster, and it killshim in the end. All your movies are the same. I can't keep the stories straight. I got kicked out. In my second month, I had a difference of opinion with theCompany Commander. I broke his arm. Poker. He tried to shut down a game I was running for some of therecruits, and a couple of the training staff. The way the regulations are worded, gambling was an honourviolation only if it took place during duty hours. So I ran the game onweekends. One night my C. C. showed up, tried to sweep all the chips offthe table, and I. Well, I have a black belt in aikido. I think he wasjust upset that I hadn't invited him to play. I got a bad conduct discharge. Starfleet needed language specialists more than they needed tomake an example out of me. They let me back in on probation, and here Iam. That's not how it works. There are a lot of common patterns. I'mjust good at hearing them, that's all. I wish I could fix warp engines with duct tape and a pocketknife. Seriously. Engineering, building things. have you always beengood at that? How old were you? We didn't see you there. They both came to see us. Maybe that means they're almostfinished. I was back in Brazil. The shuttle was coming to take me toEnterprise. Captain Archer needed me early. I didn't get the chance to saygoodbye to my students. Yo se que estoy atrasada. Enterprise no seva hasta manana. Solo necesito cinco minutos.  Math is just another language. Haye nuzhno skazat dosvidaniya. I need to tell them while there's still time. So am I. Because the desire to overcome it will spur them to move beyondthe limitations of the physical world. It was true for us. Our ancestors were physical beings. Nothing I haven't seen before. What disturbs me most about the humans is theircapacity for violence. Humans say they avoid it, but their words don't match. We're being observed. You're breaking every rule we have. That is not our decision to make. We have to leave them as they are. Then we agree. Then how would we ever learn about you? Talking is a limited form of communication for us. We're muchmore advanced than humans. We're leaving now, Captain. You won't remember a thing about ourpresence. And in three hours, you'll die as well. Are you defying me? In time, we'll study other humans."

Chess is so predictable, I'm surprisedanyone bothers to play it. What a waste. I know the rules. Observation without interference. You'll win in five moves. How do you think they'll react to what's on this planet? Do you think our hosts will die tonight? But somebody always dies. I studied your report on how the Klingonsreacted to the infection. The Klingon commander didn't let his landing party back on hisship. Captain Archer did. So it doesn't matter if an infected landing party comes aboard. Oh, I don't know. They're showing concernfor each other. The Cardassians did that when they were here, didn'tthey? Maybe the humans will surprise us. Commander, Hoshi. Just wanted to say hi. Can you tell me what's in the hypospray? Have either of you faced serious illness before? I was curious to know how you'd compare this experience withother illnesses you might've contracted. I only have a few more questions. But The Doctor identified the pathogen. But no one's made the decision to abandon the infected crewmembers. We're looking for signs of elevatedintelligence in the species we observe. I'm sure Captain Archer knows exactly what the risk is. Maybeit's not as important to him as standing by his crew. There's a way to be sure. Which is why we should inhabit the Doctor and the ScienceOfficer. Archer relies on their findings to make his decisions. Wecould witness that as it happens. The more people we inhabit, the more we'll be able to observe. You've detected a debris cloud in orbit. Captain, does knowing what the Klingons did help us at all? But if they had developed one, you'd ask them for it, right? We can stop what this virus is doing to them. We came to observe their response to the unexpected, not towatch them suffer. I know where we can talk undisturbed. In eight hundred years, no one's ever done that before? How many have to die before you'll admit humans are different? We need to stop this. What more will that teach us about them? Maybe we should be. Good. I'm looking forward to making my first report. After tenthousand years, the rules need to change. I don't think we can avoid them. I'm going to recommend that westart preparations for an official First Contact mission. Then we'd better get started. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

If you're not satisfiedwith the accommodations, we can leave you behind in a shuttlepod. Maybeyou'll have better luck with whoever picks you up. And if you don'tlike Chef's food, don't eat it. From the looks of things, you shouldprobably skip the dessert table while you're at it. I can't believe I'm supposed to speak to their ambassador likethat. Even if they have nothing to complain about? A species that actually thrives on arguing. They probably makegood politicians. Thanks for the dry run. You think he's mangy? Everything ready for our guests? Mud bath? Babel's on the far side of Andorian space. They won't allowTellarite ships to pass through their territory. This trade dispute is a little more urgent. It could turn into a shooting war if the conference fails. You people are even uglier than I remember. Captain JonathanArcher. Welcome aboard. Funny. I was about to say the same thing about you. Warm enough? Again? You don't feel free to speak your mind with the rest of us? No. Maybe you'd like to explain it to me. Why don't you changeyour uniform before you stink up the place. When in Rome. Forget it. What a surprise. A few minutes ago. They helped save my planet. Earth wants a peaceful outcome just as much as you do. Thatisn't going to happen if we choose sides. It doesn't seem that you have a lot of other options. I'm told these are authentic Tellarite dishes. I'll have him whip something up. How long to intercept them at maximum warp? Alter course. Contact Babel. Let them know we're going to bedelayed. Bring them into the Launch bay. Tell Phlox to stand by forcasualties. Nineteen. Your distress call said you were attacked. It's not a coincidence. We're carrying the Tellaritedelegation. These aren't the people who attacked you. Shran! You're on my ship. What about the black box? Tellarites. Set course for Andoria, best speed. The Andorian sensor logs. Look them over yourself. You saw the debris field. I want you to speak to your people. Find out what you can. Let's get something straight. You're just a passenger on myship. I give the orders. Back to Andoria. If you're innocent, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. From what I saw, she was a fine ship with a good crew. What changed? I hope you made the right decision. I seem to have a knack for it. It doesn't make sense. Why agree to a conference, then attackyour ambassador? Tellarites claim they've lost ships of their own. Go ahead. You expecting company? Hail them. What the hell are they doing? Call them off. Phase cannons, return fire! We need to get through their shields. How? They're going tokill all of us if you don't do something. Fire when ready. Shran! Torpedoes, maximum yield. Good work. Your government asked us to be a part of a conference, and nowyou're attacking us! What? That's enough! You want to fight, I'll throw both of you in theBrig. You can tear each other to pieces. T'Pol's found something you're going to want to see. They're identical. We've confirmed the data. I don't know what I'm suggesting, but we need to keep our mindsopen. You're speaking to my First Officer. Go ahead. Keep me updated. We've located the warp trail of the shipthat attacked us. We're going to follow it. It'll take four days to get to Andoria. By then, that ship'llbe long gone. Just not hungry. Do you think we're moving too fast? That's not what I meant. Earth's got a lot riding on theoutcome of these talks, but I'm not sure we knew what we were gettinginto. These people have been feuding for over a century. Maybe weshould've let your government handle this. Aside from breathing oxygen, it doesn't seem to me thatAndorians and Tellarites have a hell of a lot in common. Hoshi tells me you got a transmission from Vulcan this morning. I'm sorry to hear that. Archer. We're on our way. You said you found the Andorians. Hail them. Magnify. Any idea what the spikes are? For what purpose? Find out who these people are. Take a team of MACOswith you. Bring Trip along. See if he can get it working. Go ahead. Evasive maneuvers. Get our people back. Switch to auxiliary. Target theirweapons only. Did we get everyone? T'Pol. Archer to Trip. We've lost the transporter. Sit tight until we come back for you. Get us out of here, Travis. Maximum warp. Let's see what those new injectors can do Maintain your heading. Come in. Do we have any idea who built it? The Romulan minefield. But the power cells on those mines weremuch larger and more primitive. If this is a Romulan ship, why would they be stirring uptrouble so far from home? We've never threatened them. As far as I know, neither have theAndorians or Tellarites. Maybe they're afraid of something else. Thespecies in this region have a history of not getting along. Thisconference could've been the first step in changing that. The conference has been postponed indefinitely. It doesn'tsound like there's going to be an alliance any time soon. Anything fromTrip? Well, keep me updated. What did you find? Malcolm analysed the Andorian debris. He said that ship wasdestroyed by Tellarite weapons. Go ahead. On my way. Get the MACOs down there. Seal off G deck. Shran, listen to me. The ship that attacked you wasn'tTellarite. I can prove it was someone else. You're both being set up. Your ship was attacked because someone didn'twant this conference to go forward. I'm asking you, one captain to another. Look at the evidencebefore you do something you're going to regret. Get Phlox down here."

I didn't target their power grid. Bridge to Captain Archer. I believe we've found the Andorian ship, sir. I don't understand it, sir. The warp trail ends right here. Their life support's offline. You two, start down there. Let's hope the rest of this ship isn'tas cramped. Stay alert. What's happening? We'll be fine, sir. Trip! Thanks. We're not going to get very far only sharing your supply. Right. With our luck, they probably breathe fluorine. Any luck? They must have atmosphere on their Bridge. Another access tube? Yeah. Perhaps it's on one of the lower levels. There's no rule thatsays the bridge has to be at the top of the ship. So I understand our First Officer's no longer married. Well, I was wondering what your intentions were. No. Simply curious. What is it? Perhaps they'll be kind enough to give us the specs. We could refill our tanks. A little light-headed. About what? That's not why I asked. This is true. Thanks. Magnetise your boots."

This wasmost likely an Andorian combat vessel. Why would the Tellarites agree to let Earth mediate your disputeif they were planning this strike? The memory core was damaged, but I was able to reconstruct thelast few seconds of sensor data. T'Pol to Captain Archer. There's a ship on an intercept course. It's Andorian. There's a fluctuation in their power grid. We retrieved this from your ship's data recorder. This is thepower signature of the vessel that destroyed the Kumari. This signaturebelongs to the Andorian ship that attacked Enterprise. Examine the data yourself. Commander, perhaps Something wrong with your meal? Commander Tucker believes it's safe to maintain this warpfactor. Although our relations have improved recently, it's clear theAndorians don't trust us. The same has been said about humans and Vulcans. It was a personal message. It was from Koss. Our marriage hasbeen officially dissolved. You have nothing to apologise for. Their primary systems are offline. Biosigns are indeterminate. They appear to be subspace transceivers. Their hull is also lined with multi-spectral emitters. I prefer not to speculate. Uplink your scanner. They've reinforced their hull plating. We can only transport one at a time. One of the MACOs is aboard. They've hit our couplings. The primary phase coil is fused. It'll take several hours torepair it. We have to withdraw. They've matched our speed. They're falling behind. I analysed the data Commander Tucker sent back. The ship doesn'tappear to be Tellarite or Andorian. There's a remote possibility. Its power matrix utilises boridiumcells. We encountered a similar technology more than two years ago. I did say it was a remote possibility. They have been known to act aggressively against species theysee as a threat. You believe they fear an alliance? We're still too far away to detect a comm. signal. We've discovered the function of the emitters on their hull. Their disruptor utilises triphasic emitters. They can simulatedifferent kinds of weapons."
14448,ENT,episode 86,TUCKER,"Well, just about. But my people are working triple shiftstrying to finish that mud bath they wanted. Apparently the ambassador likes a good soak in the morning. Something I don't understand. These Tellarites have warp ships, so whydo we have to take them to the conference? Now we're a shuttle service. When are we going to get back toexploring? So he says, 'Well, I'm not really a pilot.' Ah, you don't getit. You know, I like these people more than I thought I would. Theydon't hold anything back. It's refreshing, speaking your mind for achange. No, you know what I mean. Ah, practicing your Tellarite. I get it. Tucker to the Bridge. Warp engines will be online in ten minutes. We'll have hull plating back within an hour. This whole section's depressurized. I can't read anything through these bulkheads. Tucker to Enterprise. We haven't run into any welcoming parties yet. We've found acomputer interface But there's no power over here. I'mgoing to need T'Pol's help to bring it online. I didn't do anything. Captain, we're ready to come home whenever you are! Take Carender and Myers first! Understood. You're down to eight minutes. I'll try to get their life support online. I can't find anything that even looks like an atmosphererecycler. I'm starting to wonder if this ship even has life support. Well, let's hope they don't mind sharing. I'm starting to wonder if this ship even has a Bridge. Your air's down to twenty six minutes, Malcolm. You see these data conduits? Chances are they converge on theBridge. Yeah? Well, who are you, her father? Malcolm! We've got something. A maneuvering thruster. It's chemically fuelled. Liquid hydrogen and oxygen. How are you holding up? That's nothing new. I should've known better. Getting involved with a fellow officer. There's nothing goingon between us anymore if you're interested. Well, you said she had an awfully nice bum. Pure oxygen. Be my guest. The Bridge should be through there."

That was a nice touch. Tellarites always have a litany of complaints. It's how theystart arguments with people they've just met. In that case, they'll just insult you. Whatever they say, youhave to respond in kind. Otherwise, they'll take offense. Sir. I wasn't kidding about Porthos. No, but you might want to keep him out of sight.

Requestimmediate Tellarite swine! They will pay for this. This is Shran. All crewto the escape pods! Abandon ship. Kumari calling Imperial Command. Been attacked. Primarysystems have failed. Request immediate. I hope you've studied Andorian physiology. How many of my crew did you rescue? Our complement was eighty six. Tellarites! We were escorting our Ambassador to the tradeconference when they dropped out of warp. The Ambassador's ship wasdestroyed in seconds. Tellarites crippled us with their next shot. I'venever seen one of their vessels manoeuvre like this one. While thosebarbarians have been talking peace, they've obviously been improvingtheir warships. Perhaps you should ask them. I suggest you scan for our datarecorder. It'll contain the sensor logs of the attack. We seem to keep running into each other, Captain. It's fortunateEnterprise was close by. They're aboard this ship? They may know who did. You better keep them away from us or there will be bloodshed. To the Kumari. I was in command for twelve years. First ship of her class. Most ofthe crew I served with even longer. They were more than colleagues. Iknew their spouses, their children. I'm grateful Talas survived. If I'dlost herARCHER It's a recent development. In the past, I never would'veconsidered a relationship with someone under my command. Andorian women are far more aggressive than Earth females. Shemade an overture. I had a choice. Charge her with assaulting a superioror mate with her. I regret that you're drawn into another of our conflicts,Captain. I doubt that war can be avoided this time. When that sensor datais seen by Imperial Command. Tellarites don't think like you or I do. They've been provokingus for months. We've lost six freighters along the border. We knowthey're responsible. You'd accept their word over ours? Let me talk to them. This is Commander Shran of the ImperialGuard. Call off your attack! My crew is aboard thisship. Do you hear me? Abort your attack! I need to access your targeting array. These are the coordinates to their shield generator. Impossible. We have no argument with Starfleet. Captain, I assure you, what happened does not represent the willor intent of my government. Admit the truth. The Imperial Guard never wanted this conferenceto take place. They've obviously taken matters into their own hands. Are you implying the Imperial Guard's been disloyal? That may not have been an Andorian ship. Its shield matrix had a completely different configuration. Several of our warships have been reported missing over theyears. The Tellarites could have taken one of them, enhanced itssystems. I'm not paranoid. Your people are trying to kill us! That can't be correct. Your sensors are unsophisticated. There's been a mistake. What are you suggesting? That these two vessels are actually thesame ship? The Tellarites have violated every accord we've made with them. They can't be trusted. Your desire for a peaceful resolution isblinding you from the truth! I've heard enough from you! Vulcans are expert liars. Perhapsyour people are behind this. Some of my crew are in serious condition. They need attentionfrom our physicians. Gral knows more about these attacks than he's admitting. How canArcher be so blind. I'm not going to entrust the security of Andoria to thepinkskins or anyone else. We trusted the Tellarites once. We won't makethat mistake again. With the appropriate persuasion, Gral will talk. Then I'll have to question him myself. Can you bypass their security protocols? I want to know why my ship was attacked. And then you're goingto answer for your crimes against my people. We know your government's behind the disappearance of ourfreighters. You may have been able to convince Archer, but I'm not sogullible. I don't know a lot about Starfleet weapons, but I believethis setting will bore right through that thick hide of yours. Thetruth. Now! Stay out of this, pinkskin. I was there! Who? It's only superficial. You'll be fine."

14797,ENT,episode 86,GRAL,"Ambassador Gral. I'm told this ship is the pride of Starfleet. I find it small andunimpressive. You may show us to our quarters. Have we crossed into Andorian space? The last time I was here, I was on the Command deck of one of ourcruisers, driving those blue demons back into their territory. TheAndorians came to your aid during the Xindi crisis. So why should we trust humans to mediate this dispute? You owethem your lives. Your people have no experience in interstellar affairs. Your Chef obviously went to a great deal of trouble. If I'd wanted to eat like this, I would've stayed at home. I wasexpecting to sample Earth cuisine on this journey. These accusations are absurd. We had nothingto do with this alleged attack. Logs can be fabricated. For all we know, they destroyed the ship themselves. Andoriantechnology is more advanced than ours. One of our cruisers wouldn'tstand a chance against two of theirs! I am not comfortable with so many Andorians aboard. Contact yoursuperiors. Have them transferred to another vessel. Where are you taking them? You can't. They'll arrest us. They'll hold us responsible forthis incident. This makes perfect sense, Captain. They sent a distress call tolure you into a trap. Your people tried to destroy this ship! Are you implying the Imperial Guard's been disloyal? I don't have to imply anything. The facts speak for themselves. What is that supposed to prove? He's suffering from paranoia, Captain. I've had enough of your lies! Archer claims to be impartial, but it's obvious he's inclined tobelieve the Andorians. We may have made a mistake in trusting thesehumans. We mustn't be Whatis this? We had nothing to do with that!"
14798,ENT,episode 86,NIJIL,"I have been unable to locate the malfunction. There's a vessel approaching. The propulsion matrix still isn't functioning. The repairs are underway. What? They're retreating. The Starfleet ship has moved out of sensorrange. This vessel is a prototype. I told you it wasn't ready forcombat. There's a problem with one of the liquid fuel tanks. No. The starboard transfer valve has been opened manually. If they make their way to the Bridge. They are. They've entered the Bridge.

If we can't repair the matrix in time, I'll do whatever isnecessary to keep it away from Starfleet. Pursuit course. The humans have seen too much. We can't allow them to escape. Find them!

14802,ENT,episode 87,ARCHER,"Previously on Enterprise Â TUCKER Evasivemanoeuvres. Get our people back. Did we get everyone? Trip, we've lost the transporter. Sit tight until we come back for you. Ifthis is a Romulan ship, why would they be stirring up trouble so farfrom home? Shran, listen to me. The ship that attacked you wasn'tTellarite. You're both being set up. Someone didn't want thisconference to go forward. It was a heavily-armed scoutship with acrew of seventeen. There were no survivors. Rigelians transmitted a visual record of the ship that attackedthem. I'm told their Trade Commission is demanding compensation, andmy arrest. Whoever's behind these attacks, they're trying to do morethan provoke a war between Andorians and Tellarites. This is an attemptto destabilise the entire region. We need to find the marauder beforeit attacks again. How many ships will it take to make this work? There's just one way we can get that many ships to help us. How is she? I have a proposal. Come in. Admiral Gardner just called. He's sending every ship available,but at top speed it'll take weeks for most of them to get here. She's stuck in dry dock. Engine trouble. Did you get through toyour people? That's all? T'Pau could have picked a better time to clean house. I'm thinking of asking them to join us. Without more ships, oursensor net's going to have a gaping hole. The marauder could fly rightthrough it, and we'd never know. Not yet. An Andorian captain might have a problem taking orders from aTellarite? There's one species that's on friendly terms with both of them. Humans. Enterprise could serve as the command ship, relaying allorders. The other ships would only have to exchange communicationcodes. You don't sound too optimistic. As far as I know, no one's ever tried to get them togetherbefore. From what I've heard about these Romulans, they mean business. If they're behind these attacks, we have to find some way to stop them,or next time, they might come back with a thousand of those ships. If you're waiting for me to stop you, don't worry. I won't. And I heard what you said. So now it's time for both of you tolisten to me. Instead of insulting you to make you feel at home, andputting up with your arrogance as a sign of my respect, why don't thetwo of you try behaving like humans for a change? There's one thing humans seem to do better than any specieswe've met. When we're faced with a common threat, we put ourdifferences aside and try to co-operate. Someone is determined to starta war in this region. I've shown you how we can stop them. But if youdon't understand that, feel free to strangle each other. Just remember,that's exactly what this marauder wants you to do. Gral's informed me that the Tellarites are also taking part, sothey'll need these codes as well. I appreciate your cooperation. Try? A few of them are a bit before my time, but they were all namedEnterprise. This one sailed Earth's oceans almost four hundred yearsago. There's no reason our people can't become allies. Go ahead. Shran. Now comes the hard part. We have to sit and wait. I've noticed. Maybe that's something we can work We're listening. That's enough! That's not going to happen on my ship. What tradition? I don't think that's going to be an issue. Ambassador Gral'srefusing to let Naarg fight. What else do we know about this tradition? Two hours ago, we spoke about a new partnership between Andoriaand Earth. You're throwing it away for personal vengeance. I spoke to Ambassador Gral about the rules of the Ushann. Specifically, the right of substitution. Not the Ambassador. I'm the substitute. You're going to have to fight me. Then call it off. Come in. You expect me to lose? He can't. I understand. If I kill Shran, or one of the Tellarites does, the Andorianswill pull out anyway. The Tellarites'll do the same thing if Shrankills one of them. So, I'm the only one who can be killed, becauseStarfleet won't withdraw. This operation is important, considering thatit might lead to an alliance of planets. If I've learned anything these past few years on Enterprise,it's that the future isn't fixed. Then I'd better make sure that nothing does. How about I just win? Things have a way of turning out differently than we expect. Let's get this over with. I got a ship to run. Not today. You think I'm losing? I'm just trying to make you look good infront of your soldiers. Now do you give up? Wrong choice. I considered it, but I still need your help. I was told that the loss of an antenna wasn't critical. And that the Ushann is settled when one fighter is rendereddefenceless. Are we done? Can you pick up biosigns? Travis, plot an intercept course. Take us to maximum warp. Alert the fleet. On screen. Magnify. Check their power signature. Tactical alert. Charge weapons. Can you get a transporter lock? Open a channel. Archer to Tucker and Reed. Respond. Target its weapons. Take out the emitters, but don't puncture the hull. You have to get closer to the hull. Can you do that? Shut down weapons. All power to hull plating. Travis, bring usabout. Trip, Malcolm, we can make one more pass. Get the hell out ofthere. Tell them not to fire. Our people are out there. Anyone out there need a lift? The marauder got away. One of the Tellariteships was hit. An Andorian warship rescued the crew. Why wait until we get to Babel?"

Some of these circuits are live, but I don'tknow what they're for. What about the other half? That'd make sense. These consoles look like crew stations. Do you think it's possible that there's no one else on board? It could be a prototype. Outfit an existing ship with the latestin computer controls. How's that? We've gone back to warp. Do you think warp control runs through here? Did you do that? You've found the off switch? Can you make any sense of this? That's where we are. If this were Enterprise, that'd be the power coupling for theentire warp control system, including the backups. Maestro. Ready when you are. It went out. Wasn't me. Negative. They're not responding. Who are you? Commander, what's happening? I've got a better idea. Make sure you're well away from the door. Everything's off. Commander, what's your status? All right. I'll reconnect the matrix. Open the hatch! Commander? I'm reconnecting the warp matrix! Shut off the radiation! There! Now shut it off! And open this hatch! Commander, stay with me. We're better off here than on the Bridge. I apologise for saving your life, Commander. It won't happenagain. Accordingto the bridge schematic, this is an access panel. Away from the Bridge. We should assume that we're being monitored. Did you ever readthe manual that came with that thing? The warning about inadvertent overload? By now, less than a minute. I wired it directly into the powerconduit. You're good at building things. I'm good at blowing them up. No, we might be safer trying to find another area withlife-support. What about the warp matrix? We're both here, Captain. They do know we're on board? I can't imagine how things could get much worse! They left us. You were right. This is worse. If I had to wear this helmet for one moreminute, I swear it would've fused to my skull. I tell you, I'd like tofind the designer of this suit and make him wear it for three days. Yeah, you would've done the same for me. You're what? I saved your life!

14813,ENT,episode 87,T'POL,"Just the MACOs. I've found a way to detect their warp signature. And Travisdesigned a sensor grid that should extend our range. Only one hundred and twenty eight. What about Columbia? Minister T'Pau is dispatching twenty three vessels. The High Command has been disbanded. Many of our ships no longerhave full crew compliments. Andorian and Tellarite fleetdeployments? Have you discussed this with Commander Shran, or AmbassadorGral? Even if both sides were to agree, which seems unlikely, theirdeployments would have to be co-ordinated, a command hierarchyestablished. Precisely. It might work. These have four species have never co-operated on a mutualendeavour. We've received the final confirmations. Allone hundred and twenty eight ships are in position. The combatants fight with these. It's called an Ushann-Tor. Andorians will consider that a further insult. Updating your will? Shran is a member of the Imperial Guard, trained in combat fromchildhood. He won't back down. If you back down, the Imperial Guard will withdraw their ships. Vulcans have a saying. One man can summon the future. Whathappens if that man throws away his life before his time? If anything happens to you. Take your places. There is still time to end this. Bridge to Captain Archer. Four ships have located the marauder's powersignature. Not at this distance. Approaching visual range. It doesn't match. We have biosigns. Two humans. We'll need to be much closer. I can't get a lock through the camouflage. They're clear. Sensors aredown. I've lost them."
14814,ENT,episode 87,TUCKER,"Understood. There's no one here. You still in one piece? Yeah, I'll let you know when my head stops spinning. Feel that? We're dropping out of warp. We're firing at someone. And I can't figure out what half this stuff is. Well, I think I found an environmental system. Here goes. Well, how about that. In a few minutes, we'll have heat andair. Why would a robot ship have a Bridge like this? Well, that'd make things a whole lot easier for us. If this ship's run by computer, what we need to do is find theoff switch. Just when it happened, I got a power spike from one of theseconduits. If this ship was originally built for a crew, all of itscontrols should connect to the Bridge. Maybe they never gotdisconnected. Keep your eyes on these consoles. Even money we just found their propulsion controls. All I did was interrupt the power to the warp controls. There'sprobably a backup that'll switch on in a few minutes. Where's Hoshi when you need her? I'm going to guess that's the power circuit I just shut down. Should be right through there. Okay, Malcolm, I'm going to flip through these like circuitbreakers. Let me know how the diagram changes. There's the first one. I'm going to see if there's acommunications circuit we can tap into. Malcolm! Malcolm, did you touch something? Do the hatch controls work on your side? Not anymore, you don't. {Reed hears something being switched on.) Reactor coolant. Radiation's ata hundred roentgens and climbing. Pay attention to that board, Malcolm. I'mgoing to try to cut power to the reactor. Malcolm, what happened to the board? That's more like it. Radiation's falling. I should've brought my helmet. Radiation's at one eighty andclimbing. I can't shut it down. You're not getting this ship back. Malcolm, no! That's an order! Why didn't you listen to me? We're back at warp. I ordered you not tohelp them. Sorry. Where's it lead? What does that give us? How long does it take? We've got to be a safe distance by now. You did all this with one phase pistol? I'm thinking we should get to the outer hull. The hull's covered with subspace transceivers. If I can linkone of them to our communicators, we might be able to contactEnterprise. Something's starting to draw a lot ofpower. It's all those systems that went down in the explosion. They'recoming back online. Not yet, but if you want to contact Enterprise, we'd betterhurry. They're probably trying to take out the weapons. Enterprise Any chance of using the transporter? We're on our way. Enterprise, we're at the hull! The ship's movement is too erratic. I can'tget a lock. I can. Yeah. Thanks for what you did back there. No, you took a big chance. Which makes what I have to do allthe more difficult. I'm putting you on report. You disobeyed a direct order. Malcolm, you're just such an easytarget."

A Tellarite won't stand a chance using one against Shran. What are you doing here? Barbaric, if you ask me. Code of the Ushann. T'Pol wants me to go over it again. See if Ican find a way out of this mess. She wants me to find a loophole. Some way to forfeit withoutoffending the Andorians. How does that help us? That rule only applies if he's married. Even if we could, something tells me the Andorians would cryfoul. There are twelve thousand amendments to this ridiculous honourcode. There has got to be one that can get him out of this. If the Captain wins, Shran's dead. The alliance falls apart. Not recently. How did he get out of it? Don't try and block with this. When he swings, intercept,deflect, and hook it away.

Hard to believe the Captain's going to befighting a duel to the death in a few hours. What are you looking at? The last I heard, the Captain sounded determined to go throughwith it. Two of us could get through that a lot faster. Look at this. Either combatant can postpone a duel indefinitelyif there are no children to continue his clan. As far as I know, Captain Archer doesn't have any kids. If he'skilled, his clan would die with him. Don't suppose we can find him a wife in the next four hours. Instead of looking for a loophole, maybe we should be trying tofind a way for the Captain to win. Have you ever been to Nobelia Prime? The tribal elders there, they can challenge you to a duel ifyou look at them the wrong way. Happened to my father. Which one of these has the combat rules? Intercept in forty seven minutes. One minute. They're targeting our warp core. Hull plating's at forty threepercent. Thirty six percent."

You were only grazed, but the phase pistol was set to kill. Is there any other kind? You're going to be fine. We'll be home soon, the two of us. I won't. See what I mean? He can't get enough of you. I'm jealous. Doctor. Lucky to be alive. If it involves killing Tellarites, I'm all for it. I'd rather co-habit with Klingon targs thanjoin forces with Tellarites. You heard what he said. Compliments of theImperial Guard. These are the communication codes we'll use for thejoint operation. Do what you have to. You're not especially difficult to work with, Captain. UnlikeTellarites, you understand ethics and try to live by them. Well, nobody's perfect. Have you served on all these vessels? My vessel, the Kumari, was named for the first ice-cutter tocircumnavigate Andoria. Perhaps future ships will be named after ourvessels, especially if we do something historic together. Agreed. No. You said she'd recover. No. I only want to talk to him! I only want to talk. You need to know about Talas, the woman youkilled. The attack was over when you shot her, but I'm not here to arguethat. Her family was privileged, her parents wealthy. She could'vechosen any career, never known discomfort. But she felt the call ofduty. She pledged her life to the Imperial Guard. Talas could've hadanything. Anyone. She chose me. I just wanted you to know. It's her blood. When a Guardsman dies far from home, hiscompanions, her companions, carry part of her back to the ice ofAndoria. I wanted you to know that, too Before you die! Not until his blood pays for hers! You will face justice at my hands! Yes, it will, pinkskin, because if you and the Tellarites don'tshow respect for Andorian tradition, the Imperial Guard will withdrawits ships. Unless this murderer meets me in combat, your precious allianceis finished! Please, make yourself at home. An old friend. I carry iteverywhere. A benefit to both our worlds. There's more to this than Talas. I lost my ship, almost myentire crew. If I do nothing to avenge these losses, what kind ofleader am I? Why should any soldier follow me again? Besides, youshould be wishing me luck. I provide a voice for your species at theImperial Guard. I'm valuable to humans. The Ambassador's decided to fight in place of his underling? You wouldn't. I'm going to have to kill you. You're my friend. I can't. It can only end one way. This is not what I wanted. I'm glad we met. In your honour, I'll continue to supportco-operation between the Imperial Guard and your species. I'll take your blood to Andoria, to the Wall of Heroes. You have the first move. Give up. A single stroke, and there'll be no pain. Never! You should've cut off my head. What good is a Guardsman without two antennae? They take nine months to grow back. You humiliated me. You respected Andorian tradition. It's settled. Vulcan? So, it's still out there. As you said, a common threat."

It appears he's located the main coupling for the warp matrix. Just what we need to kill him. He's disabling the warp system. It'll take more than a day to reroute the major circuits. One of them is still in the service junction. They've taken the reactor offline. The matrix has been reactivated. It leads into the superstructure, away from any criticalequipment. We've lost contact. Admiral, the Drone's restored contact. Therepair systems are starting to work. The Drone's sensors have detectedEnterprise. It's closing. Enterprise will reach the Drone before thematrix is restored. We've lost the emitters. Two minutes. More enemy ships are closing. If Enterprise stopsthe self-repair sequence.

ButStarfleet has informed me of a new diplomatic crisis. The Drone has taken damage before. It's designed toself-repair. That's the point of this project. No prisoners to capture, nobodies to recover. These Drone ships can never be traced back to us. The Vulcans won't get anywhere near it. What are they doing? Why? What else is in there? Is self-repair still activated? We don't have a day. Seal him in. Listen carefully, and you won't be harmed. I control the ship. That gives you seven minutes, Commander. Re-establish thewarp matrix, or you will die. You're wasting time, Commander. Theradiation will be fatal in three minutes. I can save you. Activate the backup sequencer. I'm still in control. There is nothing you can do to saveyour life Except follow my instructions. You don't have to die like this. You're wrong, Commander. Eventually it will repair itself. You'll have died for nothing. Do your duty, Malcolm. Restore the matrix. Save your commander'slife. When you're finished. Then we don't need the humans anymore. Take it to warp. Set a course for home. What access panel are they talking about? We'll deal with them when the Drone returns. It'll take days. Let me know when it's restored its ability toself-destruct. Activate the holographic skin.

Vulcans have telepathic powers. Can you identify the species? Come in. And? Could they have built a ship like the marauder? One of them does. We need to find out who's controlling that ship. Travis. Set a course for Andoria, maximum warp. We're going alone. That's why we're here. Energise. Twenty eight below? Yeah. It's hard to believe anything can survive here. Careful, Shran. You don't have your balance back yet. I'm sure Phlox would love to get his hands on one. Shran, listen to me. We should find another way. Shran! You're losing a lot of blood. Hold still. Hold still. Bleeding's stopped, but if you move it could startagain. Archer to Enterprise. Archer to Enterprise. It doesn't hurt to try. How far are we from the Aenar? Hello. We need your help. My friend's been hurt. You can read minds. I need to speak with someone in authority. I take it you know why we're here. It's a bit more complicated than that. Go ahead. Thank you. Shran. But you're sceptical. Do you have any idea who it could be? You think he was abducted? We're hoping it will disrupt the signal that's controlling themarauder. You said Gareb was abducted. If that'strue, don't you want to help him? We're trying to stop violence. We should clear the dampening field soon. Warm. We've been here before. How? She's doing what she thinks is right. That's not true. Shouldn't she be allowed to follow her ownconscience? LISSAN; She's not following her conscience. How do you know? Have you read her mind? I thought that wasagainst your custom. Anything on long range sensors? What's our ETA? Tell Malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners. If we run into that marauder again, I want to make sure every shotcounts. Report? Whenever you're ready. Very good. Keep scanning. Try to find the marauder's warp signature. She's going to be okay, but Phlox says it's too dangerous totry again. Looks like we went all the way to Andoria for nothing. Tactical Alert. Hail them. Target their engines. Anything? Fire. ARCHER; Aim for their weapons. REED; They're too damned fast. I can't get a target lock. T'Pol? Target them! Archer to Sickbay. What's going on? PHLOX; Jhamel's going to make another attempt. Is she up to it? Let's give them a hand. Photonic torpedoes, full spread. I want to thank you again. Goodbye. Same here. Come in. I've been looking over your report. I think you're being alittle hard on yourself. I spoke with Phlox. He doesn't think it had anything to do withJhamel's seizure. We were all under a lot of pressure. If that were true, we probably wouldn't be standing here now. Where? You turned them down twice before. Why now? I need you here, Trip. What's this really about? I haven't heard one thing that explains this. That's it? I'm supposed to accept that? And if I refuse yourtransfer? It's your career, Trip. But as a friend, I'm asking you tostay. All right. Dismissed. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc.

I'd feel muchbetter about this if you'd take a couple of MACOs with you. Captain, we don't know anything about these people. Another ship's approaching, bearing oh onesix mark twelve.

15180,ENT,episode 88,T'POL,"Previously on Enterprise. They're clear. And now, the conclusion. The Drone is being operated by telepresence. It's a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remotelocation. A pilot can operate the Drone from a great distance, over manylight years. Essentially. I'm still reviewing the data Commander Tucker brought back, butI believe we can construct our own telepresence unit. Doubtful. The most we can hope for is to interfere with theirnavigation. There is one problem. The data from the marauder also containeda brain wave pattern. I believe it belongs to the pilot. Apparently, telepathy is necessary to operate the device. You should rest. Phlox thinks it's too soon for you to return to duty. It came up in conversation. I can manage. I'll make a note of that. Since Enterprise was launched, we've all been near death on morethan one occasion. In the Expanse, when we were attempting to destroy Sphere fortyone, I didn't believe we'd survive. Whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflectorarray. Why do you ask? It's all we have. When can we test it? You're not telepathic. It wouldn't be a true measure of theunit's effectiveness. I'll test the unit. Considering what's at stake, the risk is acceptable. Our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time hereturns. That means conducting a full series of tests. The discussion'sclosed. We have a lot of work to do. Commander. Trip. I appreciate your concern for my safety. I think you're letting your feelings impact your work. I just need a moment. I'll be fine. I'll rest for a few minutes, and then we'll try again. Not yet. We'll be at their last known co-ordinates in six hours. Understood. I'm picking up debris. Hull fragments. Nacelle casings. Several bodies, human. Is there any word from Sickbay? A ship's dropping out of warp. It appears tobe a Tellarite freighter. If it is a freighter. It's power signature is not Andorian. Captain, I'm picking up an energy reading from Sickbay. It's thetelepresence unit. If there's anything we can do or say on your behalf."
15181,ENT,episode 88,TUCKER,"And the people running it are back on their homeworld, safe andsound. Doesn't seem fair. And use it to hijack their ship? I just need a second. Phlox? You were talking to him about me? Right. Well, I don't have the option of taking a break. TheCaptain needs this done fast. You might be the best there is at crunching numbers, but whenit comes to actually sticking things together, you're a little out ofyour league. These work better when you strip off the duranite caps. Don't ask me why, they just do. You know, when I was on that ship with Malcolm I was convincedI was going to die. You ever been there? I'm not talking close scrapes. I mean when you're in a badsituation, and you know this is it, there's no way out, and you havetime to think about it. What went through your mind? Just curious. {Corridor/Transporter alcove] How dangerous? There's got to be some way we can make it safer. I want to be the first one to try it out. Well, at least we'll find out if it causes brain damage. You're the ranking officer. Too risky. We could at least wait until the Captain gets back. Coffee, strong. Hey. I just don't want Enterprise to lose a good officer. My work's as good as it's ever been. As far as my feelings go,they're purely professional. Whenever you're ready. Indicator's moving. Doc? I'll be damned. It's working. She okay? That's enough. Shut it down! It worked. She wants to try again. You think it's smart? She's going to hurt herself. I can't believe I'm getting this from you now. Has everyone onthis ship gone crazy? Oh, I'm crazy? You're the last one that should be giving me a lecture. Vulcanneuro-pressure was your idea. What the hell am I going to do? She's good to go. A lot of movement. Fifty percent spike. ARCHER; Are you feeling all right? She's maxed it out. We could simulate a course correction. There's no getting around it. I missed a ten degree variance inthe telepresence emitter. But he can't be sure. Either way, I should have caught it. My mind wasn't on the job. Captain, I want a transfer. Columbia. They need experienced people. I think I can do some good over there. They need me more. I told you. I've said everything I want to. Captain, as a friend, I'm asking you let me do this. I can't. Thank you."

If the interface malfunctions, there could be severe neurolyticshock, possibly resulting in brain damage. Diagnostics will only tell us so much, I'm afraid. A day. How do you feel? So far, so good. Her synaptic response is erratic. It's getting worse, Commander. You're all right. You know the risks. So does Commander T'Pol. Commander, she'sdoing her job. Take my advice. Don't interfere.

We experimented with that years ago. Nothing came of it. I just received a transmission. Our scientists identified thebrain wave pattern. It's from my world, but it's not from any Andorian you'd know. It's Aenar. They're a kind of subspecies. Blind ice-dwellers. For mostof our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told ourchildren, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in theNorthern Wastes. They're extremely secretive. I can count on one handthe number of Andorians who've seen one face-to-face. I seriously doubt they have the capacity. There are only a fewthousand of them left, and even if they could, they're pacifists. Theydon't believe in violence. It seems that way. Agreed. We go in there with a show of force, we won't get a thing out ofthem. Taste that air. Really gets the blood running. Lucky for you, it's the middle of summer. The entrance is twenty metres ahead.

I didn't see the sun till I wasfifteen. Hands off, pinkskin. These tunnels branch out for thousands ofkilometres. Not a good place to get lost. Ice-bores. Worms. They live in the ice. Generate heat through achemical reaction. Big swarm came through here a day or two ago. Best to avoid them. When I was a boy, I stumbled into a largeden, wound up with third-degree burns over half my body. Afraid of heights, Captain? The ice gave out beneath me. We can't stay here. We'll freeze to death. We're well inside the dampening field. I think we just got a lot closer. My thanks. That explains a lot. Who? Now you know why. It doesn't matter why he's doing it. He has to be stopped. You owe us that much, at least. I've never been able to sleep with someonestanding at the foot of my bed. Actually, I was awake. What is it? You're blind. How can you tell my skin is blue? Every few years, there's a heat wave. I've been on worlds wherethe temperature is only slightly below the boiling point of water. I'm trying to forget it. I lost ten percent of my body weight intwo days. For what? It's never been all that hard to figure out what I'm thinking. I'm sorry. So we've been told. There's no way of knowing. Forget it, Captain. They've never even helped defend their ownworld. We're wasting our time. I've had enough rest. What is it? I don't see anything. Are you sure you want to do this? We can stop anytime you like. Shut it down! Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've arrived atthe last known co-ordinates of the Ticonderoga. You had a convulsion. You're all right now. Ridiculous. That kind of bravery is never a failure. I'm acommander in the Imperial Guard. I'd be afraid to go anywhere near thatthing. I was the fortunate one. I won't hear that from you. You make it look easy. Keep being strong. For me. We're under attack. I'm going to the Bridge. Let her try. Jhamel. She can do this. I regret much of what happened between us recently. When you lose your ship, you aren't usually rewarded withanother one. I may not see you for a while. I appreciate the offer. Let's just see what the future brings. Try to stay out of trouble, pinkskin. Valdore is sitting in the Drone helm seatwhen Vrax and two Reman enter.)"

15531,ENT,episode 88,NIJIL,"TheDrone has re-entered Romulan space. The humans did considerable damage to theBridge. We'll have to replace the entire receiver array. The ship isn't what concerns me. It's the pilot. Operating the vessel is extremely taxing. That won't be enough. He's suffering from severe mental fatigue. Piloting one ship would be difficult enough, but two The dosage is already at a dangerous level. He could bepermanently damaged. He could die. Without the pilot, there would be no mission. We'll be ready to launch in twelve hours. He's resting. I'll make sure that he is. I'm a scientist. No. What happened? I'm sorry. I understand. Forgive me. Systems ready. Enterprise is taking heavy damage. It may not be necessary. Yes, Admiral. They've lost warp power. Someone's tapping into the telemetric array. The first Drone is targeting the second. I've lost access. No! The failure is mine, not yours."
15532,ENT,episode 88,VALDORE,"Disconnect the pilot. Senator, you have a right It won't last. That would be a mistake. When this is over, you'll be First Consul. This isn't a failure. It's a setback. We have to deal with thehumans. They are the ones that brought the Andorians and Tellaritestogether. The second Drone ship is armed and ready for battle. With twoships, I can deliver a devastating blow. We will hunt down Enterpriseand destroy it. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. A transport shipis returning the Tellarite Ambassador to his homeworld, but Shran hasoffered to stay and help us track down the marauder. Assign every spare man to the repair crew. What about him? He'll have at least three days to rest. Then you'll have to increase the stimulants. If I didn't know you better, I would say you're more concernedwith this creature's well-being than you are with this mission. Just keep him alive long enough to destroy the Earth ship. After that, his health is of little consequence. And the pilot? Will he be ready? Spoken like a soldier. We're all soldiers, Nijil, from the moment we're born. When weforget that we invite disaster. You know I was once a senator? Many years ago. Vrax and I were colleagues. I even consideredhim a friend. I made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimitedexpansion. I asked the question. Is conquest truly the best course forour people? And I was expelled. I'm not trying to evoke your pity. I want you to learn from myexperience. When I was led away from the Senate chamber, I vowed neverto repeat my error and never to forget my purpose. Continue with your preparations. {Shran spots a lot of bright holes in an arch overtheir path.) Launch the Drones. Target with the second Drone. Attack vector one seven seven. Follow my orders. Continue targeting their engines. Both Drones are coming to a stop. We'redefenceless. Take all weapons offline. Stop this! Now. Resume your attack on the Earth ship. Senator, I assume I'm under arrest. So it seems I'll be serving with you again. Nijil, goodbye. Spoken like a soldier. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. There's been nosign of any other marauder ships. We're returning Shran and Jhamel toAndoria."
15533,ENT,episode 88,VRAX,"This mission was supposed to cause dissensionin the region. It's had the opposite effect. The Andorians and Tellarites have formed an alliance. They'reworking together for the first time in history. The group of senators doesn't share your optimism. They'representing a motion to cancel this mission. The mistake was mine when I supported this endeavour. Do yourealise how you've weakened my position? After a failure of this magnitude, I could be dead. We're both under arrest."
15534,ENT,episode 88,JHAMEL,"I didn't mean to disturb you. I've never met a blueskin. Don't ask me to explain. I was never very good at science. SHRAN; Neither was I. Is it true that where you come from, the temperature risesabove freezing for weeks at a time? I can't imagine such a place. I came here to apologise. When I saw you for the first time, I sensed some of yourthoughts. I didn't intend to. I know what it's like to lose someone. Gareb, the one who'smissing, he's my brother. He would never hurt anyone, not intentionally. Do you think he's in pain? I have nightmares. Gareb's bound, locked in a strange cage. He's calling for me. He wants me to rescue him. You need to rest. Wait A swarm. It'll take a few minutes for them to pass. Gareb and I lovedchasing ice-bores. Once, we followed a swarm for two hours, caughthundreds of them. We were almost at the surface. My family was veryworried. They're going to be worried about me now. I won't abandon my brother. What's it like, your ship? He's right, we're going in circles. They're trying to stop us. They're not letting us see the path to the surface. SHRAN; How could that be possible? I can't. LISSAN; They're fighting a war. Do you want to be a part of that? I don't want to fight anyone. I want to help my brother. LISSAN; Help him by standing up for what we believe in. Take my thoughts. LISSAN; You're certain this is what you want? Yes. I'm ready, Captain. It's strangely enjoyable. Is that good? Is there another test we can try? What happened? I was dreaming about Gareb. I failed, didn't I? Talas was a fortunate woman. My brother is going to die, isn't he? It's hard to be strong. What's happening? Wait. I can feel him. PHLOX; Where do you think you're going? Connect me to the device, I need to try again. PHLOX; I can't allow it. You barely survived the last attempt. I can reach him. I can make him stop. I can do it. No! It's me. You have to stop what you're doing. I'm on the ship you're attacking. They lied to you. It wasn't you. It was them, they forced you. You can stop it. You know what you have to do. Gareb! I owe you a thanks. If I hadn't come with you, my brother wouldhave died alone. Goodbye, Captain."

No one may enter another'sthoughts without permission. I know your name because the AndorianChancellor contacted us. We assign our leaders as the need arises. For this occasion, Ihave been chosen as Speaker. I know what the Andorians have told us. Someone's beenattacking your ships, and you believe we're involved. It will save time and foster our trust, if I can have yourthoughts. You have an interesting mind, Captain. Many facets. Some of those facets are in conflict. The evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. It seemsthere was an Aenar controlling that ship. We're a nonviolent people. That a member of our race couldcause so much death, it's extremely disturbing. There's one possibility. A year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collectingice-bores. We assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we neverfound his body. Gareb would not be doing this voluntarily. It's the best explanation. This device that you're building aboard your ship. You will need one of us to operate it. I'll consult with the others. Not with violence. I won't deny that your intentions are honourable, but ourdecision stands. It's time to come back. She's betraying her people. Jhamel. Very well. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've returned toEnterprise, where we received word that the cargo ship Ticonderoga ismissing."

See if their satellites pickedup any transporter activity this evening. Come in. We've heard nothingfrom the kidnappers. Not even a ransom demand. Hoshi thought she overheard one of the kidnappers say somethingin another language, but she was semi-conscious at the time. Maybe youcould help her remember. I know it's dangerous, but I can walk you through it. I had Surak's katra in my head for four days. I picked up a fewtricks. T'Pol, try to relax your emotional suppression just a little. This trajectory won't take them anywhere near Proxima Colony. Ensign. Put Admiral Gardner through to my Ready room. Shore leaves arecancelled. Get everyone back on board. How long to intercept? Archer to Engineering. Commander Kelby, respond. We could use a little more speed. Commander Tucker's pushed them higher thanthat before. Bridge to T'Pol. We're approaching the coordinates. Is one of them Denobulan? Can you tell who did this? Scan for their data recorder. It might tell us something. Target their weapons. Seal it off. Get the MACOs down there. Disable that ship. I don't want themgetting away. Pursuit course. Wake him up. Why did you attack us? That sounds like What is it? Any theories? Give our new Chief Engineer a hand. Tell him to dig a littledeeper, see if these Klingons damaged any other systems. The Rigelian freighter. Did you get anything out of the blackbox? Work with Hoshi. See if you can reconstruct any data. Malcolm said there might've been a safeguard. You're sure. Only someone with security clearance of alpha-four or higherhad access to the black box. That's just T'Pol, you and me. You're sure that freighter was destroyed by Orion weapons? I asked T'Pol to double-check your analysis. The freighter wasfired on by Klingon disruptors. I've seen the sensor logs. I want to know what the hell is going on. Answer me,Lieutenant. Malcolm, I never would've believed that you, ofall people. Corporal. Lieutenant Reed's been relieved of duty. Escort himto the brig and confine him. We've set course for Klingon territory. Wehaven't picked up any warp signatures yet. I may have to take this shipinto their space. I don't have to tell you how dangerous that is. Ifyou know where they've taken Phlox. Your word isn't worth a lot at the moment. The Malcolm Reed I know would give his life before committingtreason. Who, then? You've betrayed everything that uniform stands for. What the hell does that mean? You haven't said much of anything. You've told me a lot aboutyour father, his years in the Royal Navy. Their tradition of honour andservice. How do you think he'll react when he learns you're facingcourt-martial? Did the Klingons damage them? Can we drop to impulse? Go to maximum warp. Get down to Engineering. Seewhat you can do. You sabotaged us. How do we repair thedamage? If our reactor breaches, you're going to die with us. Go ahead. Can you remove it? Do what you can. Take us to warp five point two. We're out of options, Travis. Five point two."

Starfleet Operations, this is Lieutenant Malcolm Reedaboard Enterprise. Please acknowledge. Sir? I thought I was calling Starfleet Ops. Something like that. Am I to understand you are responsible for taking that satellitegrid offline? But you're involved. Phlox is my friend. Do you know where he is? I wasn't aware that I was still a part of your section. They may have dropped to impulse. No, sir. I'll have to bring aboard some of the debris and analyseit. Computer, establish an encrypted comm.-link. Starfleet frequency seven nine baker. You told me the Klingons were going to rendezvous with thatfreighter, not destroy it. How many were on board that ship? Yes. I'm not certain how much longer I can keep this from him. You want me to lie again? I could explain the situation to theCaptain. I've worked closely with the man. You can trust him. I'm being compromised, sir, and I don't like it. I believe we're under attack. He must have been surgically altered to lookhuman. It might've been a safeguard, in case it fell into the wronghands. I'm not quite sure what you're getting at,sir. I agree. It is a bit of a mystery. There's no doubt. With all due respect, sir, it must have been a mistake. Someone could have tampered with them. Respectfully, sir, I refuse to answer any more questions. I have no idea where the Doctor is, Captain. On that, you have myword. I'm not working for the Klingons. Captain, There are some obligations that go beyond my loyalty toyou and this crew. I can't say any more. I wouldn't know, sir. So, what are you in for? I shouldn't think so. That's a long story. I lied to him. Why did you and your men board Enterprise? You know, you may findthis hard to believe but, you and I actually want the same thing. A cure.

You're notbeing promoted You wouldn't leave Captain Archer without sufficient reason. Are you leaving because of me? You didn't answer my question. I've spoken with the Denobulan ambassador. He's notified thedoctor's wives. A mind-meld? I've never initiated a meld before. I don't havethe proper training. You? My mind to your mind. Our minds are merging. Our minds are one. I feel what you feel. I know what you know. Canyou hear me? You and the doctor have just left the restaurant. Good. Where were you attacked? Yes. Focus on the moment. Put aside any pain. Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel. A Rigelian freighter left orbit two hoursafter Phlox's abduction. According to their flight plan, they wereheaded for Proxima Colony. The freighter's warp trail has terminated. Why are you here? I'm meditating. This is where I go in my mind. Please leave. Away. On my way. No biosigns. I'm reading several bodies aboard. They're all Rigelian. Hull plating's holding. They've activated their transporter. There must be some kind of mistake. According to his bio-signature, he is Klingon. I need to run further tests. Their boarding party disabled ourantimatter flow regulators. Warp drive should be repaired in six hours. It's been erased. We may be able to reconstruct the directory with a recursivealgorithm. Subconscious thoughts are often exchanged. They sometimessurface during sleep. Most unusual. The recorder was erased deliberately. It left a unique magnetic signature. The antimatter flow regulators are locked open. Uncertain. The reactor would breach. But we can reduce pressure byincreasing speed. Please be more specific. T'Pol to Captain Archer. The warp matrix has been compromised By a Klingon subroutine. I'm not certain. It's infiltrated our command protocols."
15551,ENT,episode 89,TUCKER,"Yeah? She's a thing of beauty. A good engineer can see the differences. You coming to the messhall later? My going away party? You think I'm doing this to advance my career? Well, for one thing, this is a new challenge. It took me a yearto fine-tune Enterprise. I figure I can do the same for CaptainHernandez in half the time. She needs a Chief Engineer who's been outthere, has the experience. Look, Starfleet's approved the transfer. This may come as a shock, but not everything in my liferevolves around you. The dilithium matrix has got to be aligned within point threemicrons. Who do you think wrote those specs? Exactly. Some guy who's probably never been outside the solarsystem. I've spent the last three and a half years crawling inside oneof these engines. I know what I'm talking about. Biggs, Pierce. I want you torecalibrate the field stabilisers. Rivers and Strong, start with theinjector assembly. This bucket of bolts was supposed to leave dry docksix months ago. I guarantee you, Columbia's going to warp out of orbitbefore the end of the week. Let's get to work. I'm sorry, ma'am. I wanted to see what the situation was likebefore we spoke. Commander Charles Tucker, reporting for duty. That's right. I think there's a good chance. Any news on Doctor Phlox? We'll be pulling triple shifts if we want to meet this newlaunch date. I'll be there. Ma'am? Aye, Captain. I don't know who's in charge of your MessHall, but he could give the chef on Enterprise a run for his money. Who? I've knocked a few heads together, but we're getting the jobdone. We'll be ready for warp trials by Thursday. Well, you've got a good memory, Captain. I was getting a little too comfortable on Enterprise. Got a lotof friends over there, but sometimes it's easier to work with peoplewho are just colleagues. I was about to ask you the same thing. Is this a daydream? Well, I would've thought you'd pick a more interesting place. Like the beach, or one of those Fire Plains you showed me. Exactly where am I supposed to go? This is my daydream. You go away. Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. Just a few more seconds. I hope. Ensign? Nice work. Engineering to Bridge. We're ready whenever you are,Captain."

There never used to be a wait to get in. They asked if I was interested in becoming Director ofXenobiology. Truth is, I've grown rather fond of my shipmates just yet. What would you suggest?

What do you want with me? Why didn't you simply ask for our help? Starfleet and Denobulawould've provided you with all of the specialists you'd need. Why me? What field of study are you in, precisely? Unless I'm mistaken, this virus is a mutatedform of the Levodian flu. We should contact the IME. They may have seen this mutationbefore. I'm certain they'll be willing to share their database with us. I know of a few indirect channels. No one would have to know. You stole it. That doesn't sound very honourable. Perhaps you should ask your superiors to steal a genomesequencer? We're not going to be able to map the virus without theproper technology. This man's been infected. We're being exposed. When I asked you to bring me a subject for dissection, I assumedhe'd already be dead. What do you think you're doing? Out of the question. I thought you were committed to savinglives. That choice is not ours to make. There is something familiar about thesebase-pair sequences. Do you think it's wise to keep wild animals in here? I don't let them roam free. I have seen these sequences before. Six months ago, to beprecise. This is Augment DNA. How did modified human genes find theirway into this virus? Earth banned genetic engineering decades ago. The Augments whoattacked you were relics of another era. You were trying to create Klingon Augments. But Soong'sexperiments were all killed. Where did you get the genetic material? Their cranial ridges started to dissolve. Augment was moreaggressive than you realised. It became airborne. You should have told me this earlier! I can't sequence these nucleotides any faster. Perhaps youshould've abducted Doctor Soong. He could've mapped this genome moreefficiently than I can. They're massacring the victims? General, we're making progress, but I'll need a few weeks todevelop an antiviral agent. It will have to be tested. I can't cure this in five days! You don't seriously expect me to help you create KlingonAugments?! I won't assist you. Kill me if you must. I refuse to co-operate."

That's great. Are you going to accept? I'm the wrong person to ask. I've got a vested interest inkeeping you around. I'm all right, sir. There were three men. They were in the shadows. I didn't get agood look at them. Right before I passed out. I'm pretty sure it wasn't English. I'm sorry, sir. Nothing's happening. Yes, perfectly. I'm glad we got here early. There. Do you see them?

There was almost a romanticquality to it. I don't ever remember dreaming about Commander Tuckerbefore. The memory core was wiped by that microdyne coupler. We found it in storage locker C fourteen.

Captain Jennings said I couldhave anything I wanted when I left, so I took his cook. I've gotten twotransfer requests from crewmen in your department. It's probably better if I didn't mention names. I denied them. You're already short-handed. Quite an impression you've made,Commander. You've been aboardless than two days and already some of your team want to jump ship. I was surprised you accepted this transfer. I saw an interviewwith you after the Xindi mission. You said you couldn't see yourselfserving on any other starship. It comes in handy.

15907,ENT,episode 89,ANTAAK,"It's good to see you again, Doctor. I wouldn't expect you to remember but we met briefly five yearsago, at the conference on Tiburon. I was disguised as a member of the Mazarite delegation. Mypeople weren't invited. You must forgive the General's conduct. The Warrior caste haslittle use for social protocols. The Empire is facing its gravest threat since the Hur'qinvasion. A virus is spreading from planet to planet. Millions arealready infected. If this continues, the Klingon species will cease toexist. You don't understand the Klingon way, Doctor. To ask forassistance would make us look weak in the eyes of our enemies. It couldeven incite rebellion. I was impressed by your lecture at the conference. Your paperon viral propagation was very insightful. Metagenic research. I've already isolated the virus. I assumeyou'll want to start by mapping the nucleotides? It wasn't my idea toabduct you. Nevertheless, you are here. Millions of lives are at risk. It's immune to whatever antiviral we've tried. There's no reason to contact them. We've acquired their entiredatabase. Medical research isn't a priority for the High Council. I'mforced to obtain information however I can. Given the choice between honour and saving lives, I choose thelatter. This patient is at stage one. The virus doesn't becomecontagious until stage three. Euthanising him. It is more honourable to give one's life to medical researchthan to die for no purpose! Familiar? Boshar! Feeding time is over. Go back! There are dozens of creatures in your Sickbay. I could never keep Boshar locked up. He was my first patient. He tore his side open when I was a child. I stitched the wound myself. Several embryos were found in the wreckage of the Bird of Prey. We used them to re-sequence a number of test subjects. There were someunanticipated side effects. For a time it appeared we were quite successful. Our Augmentsmight have looked human, but they were Klingon. Stronger, moreintelligent. Then, their neural pathways started to degrade. They diedin agony. One of the test subjects was suffering from the Levodian flu. TheAugment genes modified the virus. We tried. Soong was under heavy guard. N'Vak was one of the first planets affected by the plague. How long until the fleet reaches us? They wouldn't destroy us if they knew we had created KlingonAugments. It succeeded for a brief period. If Phlox and I can find a wayto stabilise the human prior to the onset of stage three, ourAugments would survive. If we're successful, you could use them asleverage, force the High Council to give us more time to find a cure."
15908,ENT,episode 89,KELBY,"Kelby here, sir. The injectors are running at a hundred and five percent. I'll see what I can do, Captain. Commander, did you see that? On the monitor."
15909,ENT,episode 89,COLLINS,"That's what I'm trying to determine. Commander Collins, Starfleet Security. You told me before that one of them said something to theothers. The only we've recovered belongs to Ensign Sato and toyour Doctor. We did find some residual ionisation traces here. Very few people have access to that kind of technology. Doctor Phlox was involved in an altercation the last time hewas in San Francisco. Assaults against aliens are still pretty rare. If the man whoattacked him was holding a grudge We're pursuing all avenues. Excuse me, Captain. Lieutenant."
15910,ENT,episode 89,RIVERS,"The specs say point five. A warp field specialist? Aye, sir. Excuse me, Commander? Is everything allright? The diagnostic you asked for. Dilithium matrix is stable. Driver coils are configured for warpspeed."

Entertain me. You're fortunate to be alive. A Klingon who betrays his Captainwould be immediately executed. And what is that? I'm a soldier of the Empire. I'm prepared to die."
15912,ENT,episode 89,K'VAGH,"Secure him. Welcome to Qu'Vat Colony, Doctor. You will work with DoctorAntaak. Then you will die. You misunderstand me, Doctor. Antaak will be assisting you. I will let you two get reacquainted. I suggest you workquickly, Doctor. I expect a progress report by sunrise. Very observant. He won't be alive much longer. Proceed. Is that really such a surprise, Doctor? It took only two humanAugments to commandeer a Bird of Prey and murder its entire crew. TheEmpire could not allow an inferior species to gain an advantage on us. Imagine, every Starfleet vessel manned with genetically engineeredhumans. The Vulcans told that to the High Council. They weren't verypersuasive. We were simply responding to a threat. If you hope to ever leave this place, I suggest you stop askingquestions and resume work. {The two women are looking at a mangled blacksomething.) We're running out of time. If you don't accelerate your efforts, there will be no one leftto cure. The High Council has dispatched the fleet. They haveannihilated N'Vak Colony. The Council will do whatever's required to contain thisoutbreak. Millions will be infected by then. The Council will not wait! Five days. The experiment failed! You could save the inhabitants of this planet. Take him."
15913,ENT,episode 89,HARRIS,"Burning the midnight oil, Lieutenant? Let me guess. You want to know why the gridcovering San Francisco was down for maintenance tonight. Meet me at this address in one hour. Not me personally. We have an assignment for you. There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant, and it may be theonly way to save your friend's life. Lieutenant. I regret what happened. But, they had to covertheir tracks. That's not your concern. Have you analysed theweapon signatures yet? You haven't told Archer? Orion raiders have been known to operate in thisarea. You have a peculiar sense of humour, Lieutenant. Archer is a Starfleet captain. His duty would beto report everything you tell him to Admiral Gardner. They would launchan investigation. Then I suggest you adjust your comfort level,Lieutenant.

We have forty seven minutes until ourreactor breaches. They altered our engineering subroutines. If we go below warpfive, the reactor's going to explode. I've just been talking with Trip. Columbia can rendezvous withus in thirty minutes. He says he can restorethe subroutines. We're going to bring him onboard. Trip told me you have experience transferring personnel at warpspeed. We don't have weeks. T'Pol's doing the calculations now. At warp five, we'll have tomove within fifty metres of each other. Travis can handle the flying. Can you get Trip over here? This is Archer. Stand by, Columbia. Archer to Reed. We're in position. This is the Bridge. All hands brace for warp field contact. Make sure everything's ready for Trip in Engineering. Archer to Reed. You're all clear. T'Pol, what's happening? Take power from life support if you have to. But keep the field constant. Engineering, report! You all right, Trip? But if we shut down the reactor. They won't be able to hold us for more thana minute or two. They don't have enough power. Shortcut? I'll contact Columbia. Go ahead. Archer to Trip. Ready when you are. Understood. Trip, how's it going? You don't have a minute! Fifteen seconds, Trip. Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six. Four, three, two. Appreciate the house call, Mister Tucker. Stand by. Enterprise to Columbia. Thanks for the lift. Any plans for the next few days? Not when they affect my ship. T'Pol restored everything youtried to erase. We ran his face and voiceprint through our database. His name is Harris. He worked in Starfleet Security up till five yearsago. After that, his file ends. I won't accept that. You endangered every member of this crew. You answer to me. I thought I knewyou, Malcolm. Whatever hold this Harris has on you, you could have cometo me. I'm your commanding officer! If you don't tell me what's goingon, I'll go to Starfleet. Whatever you think you've been trying to keephidden, Is that what you want? Is that what you want?! Then let me talk to someone who can. Send a message to Harris. Can Kelby handle it? Something else? Nothing I can get into right now. I get the feeling you miss Phlox, too. Maybe it's just thestash of cheese he's got in Sickbay. Hold thatthought. Where's my doctor? Phlox was kidnapped. Starfleet would never authorise that. What threat? Klingons attacked my ship. Is that what we're talking about? You put him in an impossible position. You're going to have to do better than that. What else would you call it? How do you feel about it now? Did Harris tell you about this? I had T'Pol take a closer look at our prisoner's medical scans. I'm guessing the plague is a side effect of a militaryexperiment that went wrong. Harris claims he's doing this because Starfleet needs a stableKlingon Empire. I don't trust him. If the Klingons needed our help, there areeasier ways to get it. There's a way out of this. I don't have to put you back in theBrig, but you have to choose where your loyalties lie. As you were. How long until we reach Qu'Vat? Open a channel to Captain Hernandez. We know Phlox was taken to Qu'Vat Colony to work on a cure. We're going to be there in less than an hour. Phlox will be in the medical facility. We need theco-ordinates. If you don't want to help us, help your people. You all right? I came to get my doctor back. I have two ships in orbit, heavily armed. Keep working. Archer to Enterprise. Tell the Klingons we havethe cure. Enterprise, respond! You don't have to do that. My doctor canstop the plague. How strong are the shields around this place? I'm sure they're doing everything they can. Archer toEnterprise. How much longer? Can you speed that up a little? Phlox, I've got an idea. If wewant to get out of here in one piece, we've got to get that cure, andwe're got to get it fast. I don't see any other humans around. Will it give you the cure? Let's get started. This virus may be our best weapon against Krell. Ready when youare. Not too bad aside, from some strange cravings. A plate full of livegagh sounds pretty good right now. One of us needs to get some exploring done. Thanks for yourhelp. I asked Trip to stick around for a little while to help us outwith repairs."

The transporter won't operate at warp, and docking's out of thequestion. In training exercises, yes, and at warp speed one. Every move wasrehearsed in simulators for weeks. We'll have to merge our warp field with Columbia's. Has anyone ever done this before? You'll have to let me out of this Brig. Go ahead. Have them start their rotation. Hold her steady, Travis Or Chef'll know who to blame for themess in the Galley. Understood. Columbia, I'm deploying the tether. You're doing fine, Trip. You're almost here, Trip. Keep going. The tether's at its limit! Hurry up! Almost there! Trip! Bridge, I have him. The Captain and I have had a slight misunderstanding. These gentlemen are here to escort me back to the Brig. Don'tworry, I'll tell you all about it when we're not quite so busy. I don't suppose you can tell me where I'm going this time? No, Ididn't think so. Those are my personal files. Captain, there's nothing more I can add. I'm under orders. I can't tell you what I don't know. What'd they give you? Physical strength isn't everything. Being smart is more important. General Sun Tzu said that thegreatest victories are those won without fighting. Do you ever question why you fight? What if your superiors are wrong? That's not how we do things in Starfleet. Then how come you're in the same Brig that I'm in? At first, it didn't seem like lying. Covert operations. I was a young ensign, it was exciting. I thought it was done. This is the first time that Harris hascontacted me since I've served on Enterprise. He told me about theplague. He said they needed Phlox to help the Klingons find a cure. Iwas supposed to just slow us down. It's human DNA. I didn't know. Do you believe him? I wanted to tell you everything, Captain. I wasn't told where Phlox was taken, but Starfleet intelligencebelieve that Klingons have a genetic research facility on Qu'VatColony. Captain, we need to be ready for Klingon patrols. I suggest thatColumbia withdraws to a safer distanceso that we don't make a single target. They've all been recalled to enforce quarantine zones. Commander, three Klingon battlecruisers havejust dropped out of warp. They're charging weapons. They're firing on the colony. They're closing from astern. Aft cannons are down. {Colombia Bridge]ERIKA It's no use. I can't penetrate their shields. Sixty two percent. Aye, aye. Hull plating's down to forty percent. Hull plating's nearly down. We can't holdthis position much longer. What do you want? We could've explained everything to Captain Archer. Since when do we do things the way the Klingons want? Don't ever contact me again.

Fifteen twenty seven. Eighty seven millicochranes. Speak with the Klingons. What are you doing? That's not possible. Commander! Engineering to the Bridge. The subroutineshave been purged.

Open a channel to Columbia. Intercept course. Columbia? Target their disruptors! T'Pol to Captain Archer. Captain, respond! To say the least. Understood. How much hull plating do we have left? Mister Mayweather, put us directly between that cruiser and thecolony. You may want to divert all available power to our dorsalplating. Stay with them. Keep firing.

Don't mean to be a pest, but could someonetell me what's going on? Permission to come aboard? I'll feel a lot better when this is over. There's only one way to do this, Captain. A cold start. I have to shutdown the reactor and re-set the algorithms. Once we bring the warpengine back online, the subroutines should be back to normal. That's why we need to move inside Columbia's warp field. They can sustain our speed while Ireinitialize the engines. I've got a shortcut in mind. Those subroutines Would take hours to decrypt. Better just topurge them wipe them clean. What're they here for? How slight? Fancy meeting you here. Intermix pressure? Field variance? Somebody hasn't been taking very good care of my engine. You might want to take notes. I'm about to perform a manualshut-down and restart in less than two minutes. Watch me. Stand by! Everyone get away from thebulkheads! It's going to get a little hot in here! Reactor shut down in five, four, three, two, one! T'Pol, prime the injectors. Jenkins, man the relays! Just another minute, Captain. Get ready to initialise the matrix. Almost there. Full power to containment! Fire up the antimatter stream! Here we go! Any time. I'd like to drop to impulse for a whileTUCKER Captain, it's going to be a while beforeeverything's back to normal in Engineering. I could pull a little double duty to help him out. I couldcheck with Captain Hernandez. What the hell's going on with Malcolm? Fair enough. Guess I'd better get back to Columbia. Sure. Why wouldn't I? Such as? I sleep just fine. How about you? You sure about that? No, I'd keep them if I were you, Captain. It makes you lookintimidating. No, Kelby's got nothing to worry about. I'm only heretemporarily."

Living weapons. I won'tdo it. Yes. Yes. That would stop the genetic effects of the virus instage one. There'd be changes of appearance, some minor neuralreordering, but no development of stage two characteristics. Noenhanced strength or speed or endurance. But then General K'Vagh wouldnot get his Augments. He would never allow it. Do you understand what will happen if the General learns thatwe've deceived him? There is no, uh, House of Phlox. Denobulan family units aredifferent from Klingons. Wondrously so. What about the House of Antaak? As a physician in the Imperial Fleet, you've served in themilitary. I've identified the sequences that code I know where to look for the switch that will turn off thevirus. An hour. We're getting the test results now. General, I know the Klingon fleet is on its way, and Iunderstand what this project cost you, personally. Antaak told me aboutyour son. At least he was spared the final stage of this disease. May Iask how he was infected? One of these four strains has the genetic trigger that canneutralise the virus before it advances to its lethal stage. I don't know yet. That's why I have to check each of them. A week. Your fleet can quarantine this world while I complete mytests. Sterilisation is not necessary. The only possible way to get results on Krell's schedule is toinfect four healthy Klingons! Only one of these strains will work. The other three will belethal. Ethically, it's unthinkable. Why did you think you'd succeed in perfecting Augments whenDoctor Soong failed? The Earth once had thousands. They became tyrannical and starteda war. Augments don't. Their increased aggression is matched by theirdecreased inhibitions. You'd lose control of them, just as humans did. An hour, at most. I don't believe so. Never on the job. They're quite ill. So are you. Try to rest. That accounts for two of the three lethal strains. If we work quickly, there's a chance we can treat you in time. Load the amino acids. I'll extract the viralDNA from his blood. Captain. Better now that you are here. Gentlemen, please. I think I can speak for myself. Captain. Ineed a little more time to cure this plague. I lied. Your son may be alive, but he will not survive muchlonger unless I don't complete my work. A few hours, Captain, that'sall I ask. Several million patients are counting on it. Hello, Admiral Krell. This is Doctor Phlox. I am transmitting the details of an antivirus. Feel free to have yourphysicians confirm my findings, and you're welcome to call with anyquestions. As I said, in another few hours. I could finish the antivirus in less time if I had a human hostto replicate enough antibodies. Captain, I would have to expose you to the plague. I cannotpredict what it might do to you. Unquestionably. In addition to the virus, I'm injecting youwith a metabolic catalyst to accelerate your immune response. It won't be pleasant. Doctor Phlox here. The Captain is indisposed at the moment. I imagine you have your hands full up there. We have a plan to defuse this situation, but we'll need a fewmore minutes to carry it out. I'd appreciate it if you could keep theceiling from caving in on us until then. It's working. It's done! Hold him! We've got it. Is the canister ready? Send it. Open a channel to Krell. Admiral Krell. Doctor Phlox again. By nowyou may have noticed the Small package which we sent to yourBridge. What you may not know is that it contains a potent sample ofthe metagenic virus. Even as we speak it is dispersing throughout yourship, infecting you and your crew. Check your internal sensors. You will find That the atmosphere contains approximatelytwenty parts per million of the viral strain. Or if you don't trustyour sensors, trust your senses. You will feel the initial symptoms inabout thirty minutes. A tightness in the chest, irregular heartbeat Tingling in your cranial ridges. Maybe so. But I'm prepared to give you thecure. Thanks to Captain Archer, I've managed to complete the antivirus. Of course, if you destroy this colony, well, treating you and your crewcould prove difficult. I suggest you power down your weapons, Admiral,and let me cure your people. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Admiral Krell hasconvinced the High Council to call off their sterilisation programme. They've promised to distribute Phlox's cure throughout the Empire. There's no trace of the virus in yourbloodstream. In the future, it may be possible to reverse the cosmeticeffects. You did your best to correct your mistakes. That's all we canask of ourselves. I have a feeling that's about to become very popular. The cravings should disappear in a day or so, along with yourridges."

How long until you find it? One hour. I have news for the High Council. The Denobulan is close to perfecting the Augment's genome. If you sterilise this colony, then all ourresearch will be lost. Your hour is up. We are running out of time! He died in combat for the Empire. Command chose his unit for the augment experiment when we hadexhausted our supply of prisoners. My son was a warrior. He asked for no special treatment, and I gave himnone. He will become infectious soon. He should be quarantined. Be patient, Lieutenant. The Denobulan is working to stabilisethe human DNA. You will all be healthy again, and stronger than anyKlingon. I don't know. Your heart is still Klingon. As long as I draw breath, the Empire will not turn its back onyou. Which one? How long will it take? Fleet Admiral Krell will not extend his deadline. You have four right here! The ethics, Doctor, are simple. Three lives to save millions. Soong's mistake was that he made too few of them. Klingons have discipline. How long until we know which one of us survives? Would bloodwine affect the results? Then we shall drink to the bravery of these warriors! Doctor? I was told that you had been killed. We need him here. Cure? You were supposed to be perfect the Augment genome! Krell's ships are here.

He'sdone good work for us over the years. Don't be too hard on him. He wasjust following my orders. I can understand why you would feel that way, butthis is bigger than one captain and one ship. All I can tell you is that if you interfere beforePhlox completes his assignment, the repercussions willaffect entire worlds. There's been a complication. This time, your people failed to stop Enterprise. It's on its way to Qu'Vat, with Columbia. You know I don't have that authority. We had an arrangement! You agreed that both our governments would benefitif the two of us worked together. I called to thank you. Everything went accordingto our projections. The Empire's been stabilised. I doubt very much they'll be experimenting with Augments anytime soon. That's not how Krell wanted things done. When it's in our interest. I had to keep certaindetails from you as well.

It seems we're at an impasse. Instead of sitting here pointing guns at each other, why don'twe deactivate our weapons together? Now, what can we do for you? I'm listening. We've dealt with your people before. The experience wasn't oneI care to repeat. If you can give me some idea what this is about? I have a feeling he'd see it as an insult. Any chance to improve relations with the Syndicate, I'm willingto take that risk. Anything to have one less hostile species out there. Delicious. Favourable, I hope. With all those people after me, I need to stay quick on myfeet. You said you had something important to discuss with us. I'd have to agree with my tactical officer. He claims he's discovered a planet withlarge deposits of magnesite. Enough to build a thousand warp reactors. And that's just what his scanners could detect. He's offering to giveus the coordinates. He doesn't have the infrastructure to get the magnesite out ofthe ground. And he'll get a ten-percent share. He's also promised to helpestablish a dialogue between Starfleet and the Orion Syndicate. I already have. Harrad-Sar insisted that I accept a gift to celebrate thetransaction. Given the situation, I couldn't refuse. Concerns? You're telling me. The crew isn't used to having Orions onboard. I get the picture. Or lack of it. I'll see aboutassigning them some clothes. I'll speak to them first chance I get. Navaar, you and your sisters don't belong to me, or anyoneelse. On my world, slavery's been illegal for hundreds of years. I'm saying that you're here as our guests not our property. You're free to start a new life. In the meantime, I've asked myprotocol officer, Hoshi Sato, to brief you on ship's operations. Thereare certain areas that are reserved for Starfleet personnel. There's no reason to apologise. It's a big adjustment for thethree of you. I'd be lying if I said no. Not necessarily. Archer here. I'll be right there. Go ahead. Harrad-Sar was telling the truth? Keep scanning. I want to know how much is down there. I'm fine. A ship? Try hailing them. Get us closer, within ten kilometres. Phase cannons. Which means they won't be shooting at us anymore. And maybe they won't. Target them. Lieutenant. Lock phase cannons! When can we get underway? Kelby. Tell me what happened. Three other people were there. They all saw you. Tell me whyyou did this. Kelby. Not till I get some answers first. All right. Doesn't seem to be affecting you. We found this in your quarters. It's a communication device. You've been in contact withHarrad-Sar as recently as two hours ago. You were sent here to disable my ship. That was his plan fromthe start, wasn't it? Doctor Phlox believes that prolonged exposure to yourpheromones makes men delusional, and extremely vulnerable tosuggestion. That's how you convinced Kelby to sabotage our engines. Damn it! It's time to start telling me the truth! I'm not the one you should be worried about. I'm a lot better at carrying them out. Tell me. When's he going to attack us? Get down to Engineering. Do what you can tohelp Trip. I don't need you to look after me. I can handle it. We need to get the engines back online. Idon't want to be a sitting duck when Harrad-Sar gets here. You haveyour orders. Tactical Alert. Distance. Put him up. Then take out his. Protect our aft cannons. Archer to Engineering. Can we get more power To the thrusters? Hard to starboard. Torpedoes. Thrusters. Full astern. We're not going anywhere. Release my ship! They control you? The deflector? And disable his power systems. Do it. Get off my bridge. Lieutenant Reed. Take T'Pol to the Brig. Okay. Glad to hear that. Well done. You'll be glad to know my log won't mention your firing on afellow officer. Was that my imagination? It almost sounded like you were making a joke.

He's powering down his weapons. It's not enough. Captain. Decon chamber, come in. What did you do to my men? Yes? Aye, sir. At least the pheromones are wearing off.

16311,ENT,episode 91,T'POL,"A Vulcan science vessel surveyed the seventhplanet over fifty years ago. The file states it's an M class world witha flourishing ecosystem. No intelligent life. They did report one distinctive feature which bears mentioning. A species of flying reptile, some reportedly over two hundredmetres long. They're also said to breathe fire. There's been lingeringquestions over the accuracy of this report. I don't recognise the configuration. Is there anything I can do to help? With the engine. I'll take a look at it. Commander, have you been experiencing any unusual daydreams? Accompanied by intense auditory and visual sensations that wouldinvolve me. Essentially. Forget I mentioned it. It's not important. No. Why would he divulge this information? So he wants Starfleet to construct mining facilities. Are you going to accept his offer? I thought you were here seeking my advice. I've been hearing some concerns from thecrew. The Orion women. Their presence is becoming disruptive. It's more than that. Our guests visited the Mess Hall thismorning. As a result, twelve crewmen reported late for their shifts. It's primarily their attire. It might also be a good idea if you have a word with them. They're still under the impression they belong to you. Unless a newpolicy has been instated, I believe Starfleet doesn't condone slavery. Thank you. Bridge to Captain Archer. Bridge to Captain Archer. We're coming up on the planet. We're already picking up large deposits of magnesite. It would seem so. Are you feeling all right? A power reading. Not on the surface, in the upper atmosphere. Uncertain. The cloud layer is highly ionised. It's obscuring our scanners. It's an unknown configuration. It's equipped with numerous sensors, most likely a sciencevessel. Its presence here could simply be a coincidence. A phase cannon hit will destroy them. If we simply withdraw, they'll most likely cease their attackand move off. Captain. It's better if I stay on the Bridge. You're not immune to these pheromones. Your judgment isimpaired. The Captain asked me to offer my assistance. It's likely. The transmissions sent by the Orion females suggestthat Harrad-Sar's ship is getting closer. There have been altercations throughout the ship. The Captain'sbeen affected. I'm concerned about him. That might have something to do with me. There's a long-held belief that when a Vulcan mates, there's ashared psychic bond. It's difficult to explain. Feelings, thoughts, even images canbe shared. What? I'm immune to the pheromones because of my Vulcan physiology. Apparently. Reducing gravity plating to ninety percent. His grappler's directly above our main deflector reader. We can use it to send a positron burst through the towing cable. If we're lucky, it'll trigger an energy cascade. T'Pol to Engineering. Understood. Captain. Her presence is affecting your judgment. His engines are down. Weapons as well. It worked. Thank you, Captain. A court-martial would hardly be a fitting ending to thisincident. At least we've learned something about the Orions. It proves that even the most disagreeable species have somepositive attributes. I assure you, if I ever decide to make a joke, you'll know aboutit. Proved what? We do seem to work well together. You're returning to Columbia? There are still numerous repairs to be carried out here. Kelby is a fine engineer, but he lacks experience. Say what? I believe I did. I think your presence here would be extremelybeneficial to our operations. I don't know what you mean. Wait, Trip. I want you to come back. Trip! Three days ago? Agreed."
16312,ENT,episode 91,TUCKER,"Did you run a phase diagnostic? Better work up a bypass. Kelby. Kelby. We have a problem? Look, the Captain asked me to stick around. As soon as therepairs are done, I'm back on Columbia. That's right. I was his Chief Engineer for four years. He thinks he's going to lose his promotion. With Kelby? I could use a second pair of eyes on the field matrix. Thepattern's bothering me, and I can't figure out why. Thanks. Daydreams? You're wondering if I've been having any daydreams about you? Well, let me think. No, nothing comes to mind. Have you been having daydreams about me? You going to tell me what this is about? It's a good bet the problem's right there. Take it apart. Lieutenant. Talk to you a second? What's going on? You're supposed to be recalibrating the taps, not giving atour. Not to mention the fact that she doesn't have clearance. Youshould've checked with me first. Just ask her to leave. That was an order. What the hell's the matter with you? Kelby, you're walking a fine line. You're confined to quarters. It's either your quarters or the Brig. Get out of here, now. Kelby! What the hell are you doing? Blow the dampeners! Move! He blew out every junction in the EPSsystem. If we hadn't got to him, we might not have a ship under ourfeet. I'm not sure we can get underway. He did a pretty thorough job. What's wrong with him? The Orions? You okay? Why me? Great. You can run through these diagnostics. See if you canfind anything that isn't fried. You really think they're coming afterus? You know, I keep thinking back to our first mission, when wemet the Suliban. I was so damn naive. I actually thought it was thelast time we'd have to fight someone. Knock if off! That's an order! Start up again, and you'll endup in the Brig, understand? Now go help Masarro with the injectors. Now! Get back to work. That's the third one inthe last hour. The thing I can't figure out is why I'm immune. You? We didn't mate. Okay, what do you mean by psychic bond? Those daydreams. When I said before that I wasn't having any daydreams aboutyou, it wasn't actually true. So if we're bonded, what does this haveto do with me not being affected by the Orions? And you're making me immune? I don't know whether to be relieved or really worried. Trip. I'll see what I can do. Try to divert some of the power from thegrav plating. We're going to be a little lighter on our feet. What the hell,I've been meaning to lose a few pounds. You seeing what I'm seeing? Get up to the bridge. I'll be right behind you. I've almost got it. You'll have to reroutethe main conduit. We're ready. Oh, save it. Captain Archer runs this ship. You'resweet-talking the wrong guy. Let's go. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The Orion womenhave been returned to Harrad-Sar, who's headed home at very lowimpulse. The entire crew's been bumping into walls. It's like someonespiked the water supply. I appreciate that. At least, trying to make one. There it is again. I guess we proved it again. That you and I make a hell of a team. Even more now that we're in each other's heads. I imagine Captain Hernandez is getting pretty antsy to have herChief Engineer back. I think Kelby can handle them. He'd been observing my workpretty carefully, when he wasn't trying to blow up the ship. Why don't you just say it? That you want me to come back. No. That you want me back. My mistake. See you around. Then I'll think about it. Three days ago, I told Captain Hernandez I wanted a transferback to Enterprise. I realised this is where I was meant to be, and that this thingbetween us isn't that big of a deal. Guess we got a lot of work to do. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

You never struck me as being prone to jealousy. This should dovery nicely. It's all right. Well, I must be nearing a sleep cycle. You're right, I did. A week ago. Captain, his adrenaline levels are dangerously high. I need toadminister a sedative. In his current state, he can't give you coherent answers. Be quiet! It's the same thing that's affecting everyone on this ship. It'sa highly potent pheromone. When exposed to human males, it acceleratesthe metabolism, causing aggression and ultimately a form of delusion. Women aboard the ship have also been affected. I've received anincreasing number of complaints about headaches and listlessness. Isuspect the pheromone acts as a defence mechanism against competition. It's impacted my sleep cycle. I'm having to rely on stimulantsto stay awake. I've scanned a good number of the crew. So far, the only peoplewho haven't been affected are T'Pol and Commander Tucker. I would have to run some more tests, but for the rest of us theeffect seems to be cumulative. The longer we're exposed, the morepronounced the results are.

I have a proposal to make. I prefer to discuss business in person. You'reinvited aboard my ship. What I have to say could smooth relationsbetween your Starfleet and the Orion Syndicate. My hospitality isrenowned, Captain. I don't offer it to everyone. And once I have beenrefused, I never offer it again. I am a privateer. My allegiance is to myself alone. I earn myliving in various ways. Buying, selling. When the situation calls for it. Piracy is a risky business. Iprefer commerce. This is from a planet in the GornHegemony. The less said about them, the better. But they do brew thefinest Meridor in the five systems. I'm pleased. You have acquired something of a reputation,Captain. Well, you're wanted in the Klingon Empire, the Orion Syndicate. I don't know. I would imagine such a man would have a more robustappetite. Yes. Well, it's poor custom to discuss business beforeentertainment. If the food didn't arouse your hunger, this should. What do you think? Captain? I think she likes you. Her name isNavaar. She's the most experienced of the three. They're sisters. Ipurchased them at a trading post you once visited. Incredible, aren'tthey? They can make you forget most of your troubles. Of course,creatures such as these come with troubles of their own. But women arethe same throughout the galaxy, aren't they? Now we can talk business. Can I be of help, Captain? Do you need a tow? We still have weapons. You're not going to get this ship without onehell of a fight. I'd rather I didn't have to kill you, but if that's what it takes. TheSyndicate wants your head, Captain, and they don't really care whetheror not it's attached to your body. Relax, Captain. Enjoy the ride. I'm afraid you have an appointment with a pairof Orion marauders. I don't intend to keep them waiting. I can see you're upset, and I sympathise, butit's truly out of my hands. We are both slaves to the situation. You finally realise that. Yes, Captain, you'vebeen operating under a misconception. It is the men who are the slaves,not the women."
16682,ENT,episode 91,D'NESH,"I wanted to thank you. You were very kind this morning, helpingme find the Mess Hall. Wow. Is that the engine? You can feel the power. You promised you'd show me Engineering. Harrad-Sar never let us leave our rooms. I've never seenanything like this place. If it won't get you into trouble. That's where the matter and antimatter mix. The crystals let you control the reaction. You're better than him. Tucker's going to take back his position? It doesn't seem fair. I'm used to being with men who take what they want. You can't let him treat you like this. I thought you were different. What would you do to keep me forever? What would you do? Your crewman acted alone. I had nothing to do with it. They were very accommodating. You heard your Captain."
16683,ENT,episode 91,NAVAAR,"Where does Captain Archer stay? Captain Archer has a very large ship. But everything's so functional. There's no colour. At least it's private. What's your name? Pleased to meet you, Lieutenant Reed Malcolm. Come in. I was wondering when you were going to come see me. After all,I've been your property for two days. I don't understand. Are you saying that you don't want us? I've been a slave my entire life, on different worlds, fordifferent owners. What's going to happen to me? I know what happened in Engineering. I've already spoken toD'Nesh. I'm sorry. May I ask you something? Do you find me attractive? I've known so few honest men. And even though you don't wish toown me, I still wish to please you. If I choose to do this, would that violate your ship's protocol? So, this is what you meant when you said wewere free to start new lives? It seems we have no privacy either. And if I have? Harrad-Sar contacted me to see if we'vebeen treated well. It seems the only delusion here is your own. I'm worried about you, Captain. You don't seem well. I can see you're not very experienced at making threats. We were a gift, nothing more. A true commander would know howto appreciate such a gesture. No one is coming to attack your ship. Please release us. I'm obviously not the only woman with power over you. Captain. There's no one there. We asked them to leave, after they released us. Is that what you reallywant? Because if it is, I will gladly do as you say. I only want tomake you happy. I didn't think you wanted me to go. She's jealous. She'll try anything to keep us apart. She'lleven destroy your ship. Arrest her. Do it. Stop him. Commander Tucker. I'm impressed. I'm beginning to see who's thetrue master of this vessel."

This technology would give us a tacticaladvantage. We could end the war tomorrow. Sir? My only concern is saving the Empire. Captain, you're making a mistake. Understood. Don't! Lock him in the Brig. I want him alive. If anything happens to Forrest, I'll shoot you myself. Are weclear, Major? Stand aside, Commander. This is First Officer Archer. In accordance with Starfleetorders this date I've relieved Captain Forrest of duty and assumed commandof Enterprise. My orders are to Take the ship into Tholian space for a mission of vitalimportance to the Empire. I can't reveal the detailsof our assignment, but I can tell you this. If we're successful, Starfleet will crush the rebelliononce and for all. No crew in Starfleet has been tested morein battle. I know I can count on each of you to perform your duty tothe best of your ability. Nothing will impede our march toward victory. Long live the Empire. It was sent on a private channel. All in good time. Alter our heading. Two one five markthirteen. Maximum warp. Corporal, escort Commander T'Pol to Cargobay two. You'll find a Suliban cloaking device there. Bring it toEngineering and help Tucker install it. We're going to need the cloakto complete this mission. Enterprise Starlog, Captain Jonathan Archer. Thecrew has accepted the change of command without incident. ChiefEngineer Tucker reports we'll have cloaking capability within sixhours. Appear? All I require from you is your loyalty. Do I have it? I'm glad we can agree on something. Do you recognise this? It belonged to Zefram Cochrane. He used it to kill thefirst Vulcan who stepped onto Terran soil. I wonder how history wouldhave played out if Cochrane hadn't turned the tables on your invasionforce. Humans might be your slaves instead of the other way around. You're Vulcan. Never forget that. How long until we cross intoTholian space? There's a warp signature encoded on this. Notify me the momentyou find it. There is. I'm promoting you to First Officer. Reed is a capable soldier, but he has trouble following orders. And I know he has ambitions of his own. Maybe this is my way of saying thank you to you and yourpeople. Without Vulcan technology, the Empire wouldn't be where it istoday. Dismissed. Serving as my personal guard will have itsprivileges. You'll have your own quarters, better food. You'll acceptorders from me and me alone, is that clear? You already have the job, Sergeant. Don't talk yourself out ofit. Don't mind Porthos. He hasn't had his dinner yet. Come in. That'll be all. I'll take that as a compliment. He's safe. Not right now. He'll remain alive as long as you don't causeany trouble. No hidden distress signals to Starfleet. I need you andyour expertise. You saw an opportunity for advancement, and you took it. I've never been one to argue with tradition. Maybe we should keep our relationship on a professional level. Go ahead. On my way. I expect you to be in a better mood when I get back. Power the tractor emitters. Disable his ship. I don't want the pilot injured. Major! Lock on the transporter. Beam him into the Decon Chamber. Archer to Sickbay. We beamed a Tholian into Decon. Modify the atmosphere in there. How is he? Will it understand me? I'm Captain Archer. You're on board the Terran flagship,Enterprise. Answer my questions, or you will be harmed. I want to know where you're holding the Terran vessel youcaptured. Tell me what I want to know. Take it down another fifty. Go on. What the hell is that? No. I need to keep it alive for now, until I can verify whatit's told us. Find some way to knock that thing out. Can you repair the cloak? You have six hours. The cloak's your first priority. Someone'sresponsible for what happened. Find out who. Get the cloak online. Who sabotaged the cloak? I know Admiral Black has an agent on Enterprise. I want thename. Go to his quarters, search his personal files. Lookfor messages from Starfleet. If that's right, then why are you in the Brig? That junction's supposed to be off-limits. How? Who ordered you to sabotage the cloak? I checked the records. Admiral Black recommended you for ChiefEngineer. He insisted Forrest replace his own man with you. You'reworking for the Admiral, aren't you? What have you told him? What have you told him? Break him. The data I gave you. Did you transmit it to the Fleet Admiral? Insurance policy. Tucker's a competent engineer. If he wanted to damage thecloak, he could have done a much better job. Computer, locate Commander T'Pol. The sensors were damaged by the overload. Stay here. Having trouble? Autonavigation can't be released until we've reach thecoordinates I've set. I can't. They've been encrypted with a random code. We'll arrive at the co-ordinates long before then. The Bridge is yours, Captain. You going to shoot me now or wait for court-martial? The Tholians are a little more open-minded than your people. They detonated a tricobalt warhead here, inside the gravity well of adead star. The explosion created an interphasic rift. A doorway intoanother universe. The rift was unstable. It was too dangerous to send one oftheir own ships through, so they transmitted a distress call into theopening, hoping to lure a ship from the other side. Their plan workedbrilliantly. The Tholians rely on outside labourers. Humanoids. Some of themcan be bought for the right price. My contact transmitted these images before his signal wasjammed. Computer, enhance grid three alpha. According to some theories, everything that exists in ouruniverse should also exist there. The Tholians quantum-dated a piece of the hull. This ship isnot only from another universe, it's from another time. About a hundredyears into the future. Imagine the technology we can find on that ship. New tactical systems, advanced bio-weapons. Engines that can reachspeeds we can only dream of. All of it ours for the taking! Magnify the moon on the far right. Any sign of the crew? Destroy it? We have to take the ship with us. Sir, you can't do this. They're gutting the ship. This must be the Captain. Get started. How much longer? Stand aside, Commander. Can you bring weapons and engines online? Give me a hand withthem!"

Aren'tall Tellarites guilty of something? Sir, let me take him down to the Cargo bay. I'll finish himquickly, quietly. Still, it'd be tragic if there was an accident on the way to theBrig. Perfectly, sir. Captain on the Bridge. There's one biosign aboard. Tholian. He's seen us. He's arming weapons. Done. It wasn't my doing, sir. I targeted his weapons only. Captain. A distress signal. You think it has a comm. device in there? Sir, I recommend we beam it into space immediately. There are dozens of feeds on this deck, and the only one thatoverloads is the one connected to the cloaking device. The saboteur entered this junction anddeliberately overloaded this waveguide. The intruder alarms were disabled. There's only one way I know of. By running a high-leveldiagnostic scan. Commander Tucker initiated a scan thirty minutesbefore the overload.

Twenty thousand kilometres. There's an overload building in his reactor. I believe the pilot may be attempting to destroy his own ship. We have the pilot. A short-range transmission. Its crystalline structure may act as a natural transmitter. Flux coupler. You should speak to Captain Archer about a promotion. Why would I do that? We agreed never to discuss that. I'd hardly call it a favour. You enjoyed yourself. I needed time to find help. I've disabled the internal sensors and the comm. system. I can't alter our heading. The helm's not responding. It'll take several days to break the encryption. A parallel universe? The Science Directoratehas examined all of these theories. They've found no evidence ofalternate realities. This is ludicrous, Captain. Someone has fabricated this evidenceto lure us here. Commander Archer is guilty of assault and mutiny. Sir, I believe we should send The Captain wants a progress report. Perhaps you should direct your anger at Commander Archer. You're mistaken. Not necessarily. I lured you away from Engineering with the promise of a sexualencounter. My mind to your mind. Once we were alone in my quarters, I implanted a telepathicsuggestion. My thoughts to your thoughts. I compelled you to sabotage the power grid. After you completed the assignment, wemelded again.

Primary systems are offline, including lifesupport. We're reading thirteen biosigns, all alien. One of themappears to be reptilian. They're clustered in this section.

TheTholians aren't part of it. You see this as your big chance, don't you? You bring that ship home, and you'll be a hero. The Emperorpins a medal on your chest. You might even get that command you'vealways wanted. Resume your station. You can either go back to the Bridge or take the place of thatTellarite. Which do you prefer? Reviewing status reports. You're the one person on this ship that I don't mind giving into. Is that what you heard? You've been listening to propaganda. Things went badly at TauCeti. Very badly. We lost twelve ships. Keep this to yourself. If thecrew learns what really happened You'll hang for this. Was something damaged? You really think that the Admiral would plant a spy on my shipand then tell me who it is? Follow his orders, and you'll be executed as a co-conspirator. This isn't like you, Jonathan. You never lusted for power andglory. That's why I trusted you at my side for all these years, becauseyou have no ambition. Release me and I promise your death willbe quick. You won't get that guarantee from the Admiral. Kill me andshe'll never forgive you. I wondered what was keeping you. No alarm? We'll take the Bridge first. Set a course out of Tholian space, maximum warp. Full stop! You did this.

He received thedata you sent him. The Admiral finds your suggestion intriguing. Sinceyou've already locked us on this course, I've been ordered toinvestigate your mystery ship. You betrayed me. Don't think for onemoment I'm going to forget that. Get cleaned up. You're briefing thesenior staff in an hour. An Earth ship? That's enough, Commander. I said shut up! We're investigating this. Get that cloakingdevice working. Go ahead. Engage the cloak. Let's see where we are. We'll send an assault team aboard. You brought us here, youlead it. Download whatever you can from the database, then destroy theship. It's too dangerous. We are deep in Tholian space. You have your orders! Dismissed. Go with him. I don't want Archer to return fromthis mission. Do I make myself clear, Commander? Bridge to Phlox. What's happening down there? Well then kill it, now! Doctor? Contact Archer. Tell him to abort the mission. Lay in a courseout of here. Target the nearest ship. Fire! Torpedo launchers, fire when ready. Get us out of here.

Thisship is not only from another universe, it's from another time. About ahundred years into the future. Imagine the technology we can find onthat ship. Ours for the taking. Commander! Release the docking clamps. What about weapons? Raise them. I'll alternate port and starboard thrusters. That should shakethem loose. Firing aft thrusters. How much longer for weapons? Mister Tucker. What was that? It's now or never! Full thrusters. Does this thing have aft torpedoes? Bring them onboard. We need warp drive. If we don't have warp capability in twelve hours, I'm going tofind a new Chief Engineer. Keep them under close surveillance. Once warp drive isrestored, we'll set a course to rendezvous with the assault fleet. There's no time! The Empire could lose this war in a matterweeks if we don't get the Defiant and its weapons to the front lines. Dismissed! Commander. Not you. I should shoot you for betraying me. You swore your loyalty to me. Why are you telling me this? I never had a problem with your people until they became a partof this rebellion. If I had another officer capable of doing your job,I'd show you to the nearest airlock. I need you to get this ship up andrunning. But if I hear so much as a rumour that you're working behindmy back Get out. I found it in the Captain's wardrobe. I can't find a mention of it anywhere. The Empire. As far as I can tell, it doesn't exist in the otheruniverse. A lot of the names are the same, but their history has beenrewritten. Instead of building an empire, Earth became part of aninterspecies alliance. More like a Federation of Fools. Computer, access biographical file, Starfleet Officer HoshiSato. Hoshi Sato. Comm. Officer on Starfleet's first warpfive ship. In her late thirties, she created the linguacode translationmatrix. I can tell you who she married. It even says how you died. But this isn't you. There's nothing great about that man. He sold out Earth'sfuture to a group of subhuman species. Great men are not peacemakers. Great men are conquerors. I already have a command of my own. Something bit him? Can you find this thing on internal sensors? The slaves we captured, bring one of them to the Briefing Room. What attacked my crewman? I'll kill you now if you don't. Stand aside. From what I'm told, the maximum setting can actuallydisintegrate a person. I've been looking forward to trying it. Who's name? Where in the crawlways? What species? They're taking too long. When my ship was in jeopardy, I didn't let Security handle thesituation. I took care of it myself. I'd have better luck sending a squad ofTellarites to capture this thing. Put an assault team together. I'lllead it myself. Can you pinpoint its location? I want to talk to it. This is Captain Archer. Return our plasma regulators now. Give me what I want, and we'll talk. This is not a negotiation! The regulators, now! If you don'tcomply, I'll give the order Major, get the team together. Your best men. He has no intention of returning the regulators. If we give hima shuttle, he'll contact his people and come back here with a warship. Without warp drive, we'll be an easy target. Defeat this Gorn and you'll finally earn the respect you deserve. I'll seal off the bulkhead here. That'll leave him with onlyone escape route. Flush him out, drive him into this junction. I'll bewaiting for him. Go ahead. Meet us in Junction Three. Archer to T'Pol. Where is it? We're going to Plan B. Access theenvironmental controls on that deck. Wait for my signal. Archer to T'Pol. Section four A, on my mark. Now! Give me your weapon. Defiant Starlog, January 18, 2155. We've recoveredthe missing engine components and I've ordered a course to rendezvouswith the assault fleet. This is the Captain. All hands to battle stations. Lock on their reactor. Fire when ready. Pursuit course. Fire when ready. No. Let them go. I want the other rebels to know what happenedhere. Get me Admiral Black. Sorry we're late for the party, Admiral. It's going to take some time to explain, sir. Perhaps you'dlike to see the Defiant for yourself. Glad you agree, sir. Respectfully, sir, you have the authority to grant abattlefield promotion. The Defiant. They're never going to give you thisship, you know that. They'll tear it apart, try to learn its secrets. If you're lucky, you'll end up commanding a moon shuttle. Don't you seewhat the Admiral's planning? He's going to present this ship to theEmperor himself. He'll take all the credit, and you'll end up ahistorical footnote. That's Captain. You're relieved, Admiral. Our entire assault fleet wiped out by a rebel attack. Thousandsof your fellow Starfleet officers dead. If the Defiant hadn't arrivedwhen it did, all of you would be among them. And who are we to blamefor this? Not the brave men and women who gave their lives for theEmpire. The criminals who are losing this war are sitting in theircomfortable offices back at Starfleet Command. Their weakness invitedour enemies to strike, and their corruption and arrogance have broughtthe Empire to the brink of defeat! I've been a soldier all my life, andI will not stand by and let these people destroy an empire that hasendured for centuries! I ask you, all of you to join me. We cannot putdown this rebellion so long as our forces are commanded bydishonourable men. Before we can defeat the rebels, we must defeatthem. That ship out there is the key to our victory. With the Defianton our side, there will be nothing to stop us. With your help, I will return to Earth and restore the Empire toits former glory. Let us advance where the omens of the gods and thecrimes of our enemies summon us! The die is now cast! Long live theEmpire! Long live the Empire! Shoot the first one who stopsapplauding. My senior officers don't think I can do this. T'Pol doesn't approve, either. I can see it in her eyes. Not just her. We'll get rid of all the non-Terrans. I'lltransfer them off Defiant. The rebels have spies everywhere. I can't afford to have asingle alien aboard my flagship. I've got nothing against Phlox. His people aren't rebels. It'snot in their nature. He can stay. I think you, I think you've got the basics down. Put me through to Fleet Admiral Gardner. Corporal. EscortCommander T'Pol to Transporter Room Two. Your service aboard this shipis no longer required. I take it you received my message. You've seen the specs on the Defiant. You know what its weaponscan do. He's not available right now. I suggest you order your forcesto stand down. Starfleet can't afford to lose any more ships. Who are you working with? I hope you'reprepared to die. The Defiant will prevail. It's simply a matter of firepower. You're mistaking our universe for someone else's. Take a team aboard Avenger. Confine every alien on that ship. You've been looking forward to that for a while, haven't you? Archer to the Bridge. Report! I need weapons! Raise them! Destroy them! Photon torpedoes. Lock on to their reactor. Before I forget, first thing tomorrow, I want you to erase thehistorical database. I don't want anyone else getting any ideas aboutthis Federation of Planets. Exactly. They're loyal to the Emperor. They don't really care who it is. By the time the fleet arrives, the reign of Emperor Jonathan Archerwill have already begun. Once we put down the rebellion, I'll expand the Empirethroughout, throughout"

It's not wise to make that gesture, even behind closed doors. Itis agreeable to see you again. The implications are intriguing. This alternate universe is very different from ours. I'm notcertain a Federation could ever exist here. That was many years ago. How? Data will be of little value. Archer still controls that ship. What? I'm too old to become a revolutionary. You're the only non-Terran on the Defiant. Any of us wouldarouse suspicion. Are you loyal to the Empire or not? If Archer fails, his crew will have to answer for his crimes. Don't forget the females. You'll be able to choose as many concubines as you'd like. Shut down the turbolifts. Secure the Bridge. I need an estimate. You need to remove the duotronic module. The relays are behind it.

17085,ENT,episode 93,T'POL,"A parallel universe. I amnot a slave. Enterprise is under attack. I can't. We're free. Six Tholian ships moving toward us. Tactical systems are online. The station's opened fire. How much time? I suggest we make use of the alien workers. They may knowsomething about these systems. We're in no condition for battle. This ship is designed to be operated by a crew of four hundred. There are only forty seven of us. The logical course of action is totake Defiant to Earth, allow Starfleet to study it, reverse-engineerits systems. The orders giving you command of Enterprise were obviouslyfabricated. It was my duty as a Starfleet officer to help CaptainForrest regain control of his ship. You should be aware Captain Forrest ordered me to kill you. Forrest is dead. His orders are no longer valid. You are mycommanding officer. Understood. It's not in the primary hull. Sensors are still offline on theEngineering decks. Whoever sabotaged us knew exactly which components to steal. T'Pol to Major Reed. Bring another prisoner to the BriefingRoom. The Gorn's offer is reasonable. The Gorn's moved into the primary hull. It's on Deck Nine. Acknowledged. Standing by.

You may want to learn more abouttheir Federation. Did you know in the other universe, humans andDenobulans are considered equals? As are Vulcans. You don't find thisinteresting. Perhaps you should reconsider the repercussions Captain, they're no threat to us. I recommend we Did you review the historical files? Intriguing? I thought you were an idealist. We have to take action. Archer intends to overthrow Starfleetand the Emperor. SOVAL; Archer is right. The Empire has become corrupt. A new leader maychange things for the better. Not for our people. The weapons on that ship will annihilate therebels, including thousands of Vulcans. We can give them an advantage. I can download the data on Defiant's engines and tacticalsystems. We'll give it to them. I'm going to destroy that ship. I can disable Defiant's power systems, but I'll need your help. Do you want to spend the rest of your life serving the Empire? I know Archer. He blames our people for inciting the rebels. Ifhe becomes Emperor, he'll lay waste to Vulcan. I can't do this withoutyou. You heard Archer's speech. He's delusional. Archer plans to kill the Emperor and take his place. We'll be executed. There's an old tradition. If someone savesthe Emperor's life, it's said there's no request he can refuse them. Consider the possibilities. A medical facility of your own with unlimited resources. You couldconduct experiments as you see fit. What's this? Schematics? I'm surprised you're not exhausted from all the beds you'vejumped into recently. My death will change nothing. You will not prevail. The Federation is our future. It may take centuries, but humanity will pay for its arrogance."

Engineering's been stripped to the bulkheads. But the good newsis, most of what they took was still sitting in my hangar deck. But Ineed time to figure out how to put it all back together. Two or three days. Sir, I'm not even sure what some of thesesystems are supposed to do. It's like I'm Chief Engineer on a steamshipcoming aboard the first interplanetary transport. What's the problem? Why are you bothering me with this? They're probably on thehangar deck. You'd better find them, because if this junction's not on linein ten minutes, I'm going to tell Archer you're the reason we don'thave warp drive. There's no sign of the regulators. Without them, wecan't initialise the reaction chamber. We're stuck at impulse. It's a power drain. Primary relays. No. It's probably just a micro-fracture in the conduit.

I was merely researching classical literature. I wanted tocompare our major works with their counterparts in the other universe. I skimmed a few of the more celebrated narratives. The stories weresimilar in some respects, but their characters were weak andcompassionate. With the exception of Shakespeare, of course. From whatI could tell, his plays were equally grim in both universes. I find it dangerous. If I were the Captain, I'd restrict accessto that database. I'm certain he wouldn't want to give his crew anyideas. This is Phlox. Acknowledged. Neither of you appears to be injured. PHLOX; Sabotage the Defiant? Have you lost yoursenses? It's not a delusion if the Captain has the power to do what hesays. And from what I've seen, he most certainly does. I should reportyou both. Of course I am! The Captain has proven himself in battle. Perhaps he should rulethe Empire. Females? If the Emperor were my patient, I'd be obligated to save hislife. I suppose what you're suggesting isn't that different. These interruptions aren't helping.

I hope you're not planning on getting sick anytime soon. In caseyou haven't noticed, your doctor is an alien. I've never been the consort of an Emperor before. Is thereanything I need to know? Save it, Commander. The schematics you downloaded. Where arethey? Let's go. I was hoping you'd put up a fight. Commander Tucker told me I should give you a few pointers inthat area. Bring her. There's no point in continuing. She's not going to talk. Weshould kill her. They've taken heavy damage. We'll lose all the data on our counterparts. It'll only take a day for the fleet to return to Earth. Do youthink the commanders will support you? Are you all right? Open a channel to Fleet Admiral Gardner. This is the Starship Defiant. If you don't surrenderimmediately, we'll begin targeting your cities. Respond. You're speaking with Empress Sato. Prepare to receiveinstructions. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Not as troubling as something else we learned. You were once amember. That's why you wanted this kept quiet. You were eighteen. I don't care what you did when you were young, Minister. I needyour help. Thank you. Like mining colonies. Tell Travis to see what he can do. I need to speak to Gannet. Come with us. You reconfigured your universal translatorto record messages from all the other translators. You were spying onthe delegates. We did a background check. In the last month, you made threetrips to the lunar colony. Depends on what you're doing there. Two of my crewmen are at Orpheus Mining Complex. We've lostcontact with them. Are they in danger? Take her to the Brig. Get her whoever she wants. I'm sorry, Travis. Archer. Can you identify it? Hail them. Pursuit course, Travis. Tell Starfleet Command we're going after them. Where?"

It isn't calibrated for this type ofpatient. Fever's diminished. She's fighting it off. Intravascular pressure has stabilised. Blood oxygenation isgood. We don't want to disturb her. I needed her expertise. I thought she was reliable. If she'd told them anything truly damaging, I think we'd knowit by now. I think that she might have become attached to the patient. Shespent a great deal of time caring for her. Me? I feel no differently about it than anyone else that I'vetreated. I understand. Yes, sir."

I've heard of them. They want to stop all contact with alienspecies. I remember they made a lot of noise back when Enterprise waslaunched. That's why they killed her? I was getting to that. They claim they don't know anything about it. I believe them. You just don't know what? The autopsy data confirms what we alreadyknew They don't even know where she'd been living for the past year. It's like she dropped off the face of the Earth. You know something? That's what they prescribe for extended zero-G missions. It'shardly used anymore outside of military exercises. Not since theinvention of artificial gravity. I have heard that the moon is a hotbed of Terra Prime activity. You know, I think Travis has a friend who worked on Orpheus. He mightbe able to get a couple of us inside. We could pay a little visit,undercover. Yes, sir. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. With help fromTravis's contact, Trip and T'Pol have been processed into the OrpheusMining Facility. Hoshi. Is there anything I can help with? Carry on. She's a spy for Terra Prime. You sure know what everyone else was talking about. For? Your editor claims he never sent you. They're on the surface. They've landed near the verteron array. It's used to redirectcomets.

17475,ENT,episode 94,T'POL,"I'm sure history will reflect our contribution. You've set a formidable goal. The drafting of a charter in sixweeks? Commander Tucker does have a point. Enterprise laid thefoundation for this event. Perhaps it should be you they'rephotographing. Excuse me? Her name was Susan Khouri. She was a medical technician. She'dbeen having some emotional trouble. Took a leave from work over a yearago. Come in. It's difficult to talk about something that doesn't make sense. Neither do I. I've never been pregnant, Trip. I can't. Do you believe me? Trip, the moment Phlox said that the child was ours, I knew itwas true. I haven't. I can't explain how it exists, but I know it does. There's achild out there, and it's ours. I'm Vulcan. The case file contains very little else in the way of evidence. Some biographical data on Khouri. Most of it's out of date. The nearest one is Orpheus, on the moon. I'd like to volunteer as well. We still have twenty minutes before we have to report to theforeman. The map is correct. We could ask for directions. What? Any particular reason? Trip. I know you're not convinced I've told you the truth, about thechild. You think I might have gotten pregnant without your knowledge. I know. No. Have you? I believe so. I don't particularly enjoy it, either. I've learned something. A doctor from one of the medical facilities was found deadyesterday. They think it was a cave-in. He worked at the same clinic as Susan Khouri. I think so. Inside the system?"
17476,ENT,episode 94,TUCKER,"Nobody knows that better than him. He could've at least mentioned Enterprise. Who does he thinkgot the Andorians and Tellarites talking? Not if he's writing it. Any idea who the hair belonged to? We got to talk about this. Phlox said doesn't lie. Then how do you explain all this? Yeah. Phlox must be wrong, that's all there is to it. If you'venever been pregnant, then you can't have a baby. But you said you'd never been Then what are you saying? How do you know that? Got a minute? This baby, can you tell if it's a boy or a girl? A girl. Is it okay? I mean, it's part human and part Vulcan. That's good to hear. I still can't believe it. She could have gotten pregnant and not told me about it. Yeah, I guess I do. That's good advice. You know, my father always wanted agranddaughter. He bugged my sister about it constantly. Yeah. I want to be a part of that visit. This is the second time we've been through here. We've seen allthis before. Maybe you downloaded an outdated map. Maybe you're reading it wrong. Give me that. I think I know what theproblem is. We're lost. Let's try that direction. It's the only tunnel I don't recognise. I think we're getting there. What do you mean? I never said that. You been talking to Phlox. Look, it's because you're Vulcan, isn't it, that you know allthis. I am sick and tired of this bond we've got. Listen, for the last time and for the record, I do believe you. And if you get anymore feelings. What? There it is. Come on, let's go. I guess you found me out. Turner. Change of scenery. Know what you mean. Sometimes I wonder where it's all going to end. Someone's got to make a stand. I'll try and make it. One of the locals isn't very fond of Vulcans. You were saying? You're not buying it. I think we each know what we're doing tonight. Are you all right? What did you do to her? Who the hell are you? Not for long. You're behind this. I want to see her. Where are we going? You're going to warp? We'll be lucky if we don't fly apart."

They didn't say. Do we know who she was? I have a very good idea. It was froma child no more than six months old. I used every identificationprotocol I'm aware of. I even used a Klingon procedure. It contains Vulcan and human DNA. I had the computer search forany matches in the Starfleet databank. When I got the results, I ranthe search three more times just to be certain. According to every analysis, this child is the offspring ofCommander Tucker and Commander T'Pol. Certainly. It's a girl. Vulcan and human physiology are not all that dissimilar. Fromthe evidence I have, there's no reason to believe she's anything butperfectly healthy. You'll also be interested to know she has your eyes, and T'Pol'sears. I'm in something of a quandary about it myself. Especially sinceT'Pol's never been pregnant. And she had the embryo removed, also without your knowledge? Ibelieve you know the answer to that theory, Commander. We'll get to the bottom of this soon enough. Until then, Isuggest you keep any such theories to yourself. It seems he got his wish. That may be exactly what happened. Her blood had elevated levels of growth hormone. I ran some moretests and found traces of myofibrilin. It is still given to workers in remote places where artificialgravity isn't practical."

Six of the universal translators started confusing Rigelian withAndorian. There's a glitch somewhere, but I can't find it. You accidentally triggered an ID protocol in the network.

What are you doing here? A story? I've got some work to do. Gannet. He know how you feel about space exploration? That it's thelast vestige of colonial impulse? Find another story to do. Then you're going to have to find another source for yourinformation. Can you give me one reason why I shouldn't avoid you? And it looks like you've changed your mind. That's the first honest thing you've said. That was some serious flying, trying to keep the warp fieldsaligned. Columbia was fifty metres above us. One wrong move and wewould've lost Commander Tucker. When I was studying to be a pilot, I memorised something ChuckYeager said. I never let myself be afraid. I just focus on the dialsand concentrate on flying. Most of the time, simple works best. These are the shuttlepods. Shuttlepod One. Do you want to see inside? I always thought so. Unfortunately, we use the shuttlepods lessand less. We're getting more comfortable with the transporter. Yeah, but there's no skill involved. I've always had a tendency to get attached to machines. It'scrazy, but every time we use the transporter, I feel we're kind ofturning our backs on these guys. When I saw you at that conference, I started thinking aboutthings, decisions I've made. Don't do that. Whenever things get a little serious, you always turn it into ajoke. You and your bad habits. I'm glad we finally left the shuttlepod. I like flying them. What was that? I'm just worried about some friends of mine. I'm under orders not to talk about it. Let's change the subject. How come you haven't settled down? And what constitutes the right circumstance? I've spent my whole life in space, going from one place to thenext. Seeing you, I was wondering, maybe the next challenge, at leastfor me, is to stay in one place for a while. All that stuff I said about leaving theship. What's going on? Maybe she was after a story. It doesn't mean she worked forTerra Prime. Aye."

They had a resurgence following the Xindi attack. We thinkKhouri was trying to leave the movement. Her defection may have had something to do with the child. The child belongs to two of your crewmen.

Only it wasn't thelandscape I got sick of. At least there aren't as many of them up here. Seems like everywhere you go, humans are getting to be an endangeredspecies. Bad enough you can't walk down the street without some freakshow scaring the hell out of your kids. Now the government's makingtreaties with them. It's going to end with human beings becoming second-classcitizens on their own world. Yeah, that's how I feel, too. Some of us are meeting tonight attwenty two hundred. Level seven, junction four. I think you'll likewhat we have to say. I'll look for you. Seven million people wiped out by aliens. Did the Xindi even apologise? Did our government ever demand an apology? And where are the reparations for the families of those sevenmillion? And now those same leaders want to form a Coalition withTellarites, Andorians, Rigelians, Coridanites and Vulcans! Vulcans, whonot too long ago, massacred forty five humans working at the Earthembassy! Nathan Samuels claims that future generations will look backon this era with pride. But if things keep going the way they're going,there won't be any future generations. At least not human. I lovehumanity too much to sit by and let that happen. It's estimated that there are at least five thousandunregistered aliens on Earth. Now, another study puts that figure atten thousand. This insanity is the direct resultof our government's policy and the enforcers of that policy, Starfleet! We need to send a message to the people in power. And there's someonehere tonight who is going to help us do just that. Commander Tucker, ofthe Starship Enterprise! Hey, hey. Everyone's aboard, sir. We're being hailed. It's Starfleet Command."

There haven't been many slow news days since the Xindiattack. I hear you're going to be in the neighborhood awhile. We should get together. If we wait another four years, we'regoing to have too much catching up to do. I'll pretend that was an enthusiastic yes. Back to work. I can't decide if I like you better inuniform or not. I've been assigned to do a story on Enterprise. They can builda ship that goes faster than light, but they can't give you adecent-sized room. It's told from the perspective of the crew. It'll cover themissions, the perils, life in space. So, shall we start with a tour? You're not on duty. Okay, so, maybe I wasn't assignedthe story. Maybe I suggested the idea to my editor. I only said that to keep you from signing onto this mission. It's too late. It's due a week from today. Why are you avoiding me? We both called it off. It was a mutual decision. I haven't decided yet. So, reward me by giving me that tour. How did you keep your cool? That simple, huh? Which one did you use to penetrate the Sphere in the Expanse? If it's okay. Beautiful little ship. Why? Makes sense. Gets you there in a few seconds. Nothing to fly. You can't make a choice without leaving something behind. Is it my imagination, or are you actually opening up to me? What? It's a bad habit. I have a lot of those. Here'sanother one. When I'm attracted to someone, I can't hide it for long. I thought you liked shuttlepods. Sure felt like we were flying. I have a rule. If I'm in bedwith someone, they have to be in bed with me. You are not here. Want to talk about it? That's the last thing you should tell a reporter. I'm never going to settle down. It doesn't mean I'm not goingto get serious with someone, if the right circumstance comes along. I'll know it when it happens. What did you mean earlier aboutreconsidering some decisions you've made? Of course, it's off the record. While you're on duty, you mindif I stay here and work a bit? Something wrong? Where? She's not here to do a story on Enterprise, Travis. I don't know what you're talking about. Is that a crime? I was on assignment. My news agency. Look, if I'm under arrest, then I don't know anything about your crewmen. I want to speak with counsel. Now."

17856,ENT,episode 94,GREAVES,"I gave the men your message. We'll be ready at a moment'snotice. They already know. Done. Colonel Green. Sounds like we had the same professor.

17857,ENT,episode 94,PAXTON,"How serious? I told you to notify me if there was any trouble. Now, you saythis has been going on for days? Well? That's good news, for both of you. She looks so innocent. It's almost possible to forget what sherepresents. No. Captain's Starlog, January 19, 2155. Enterprise hasbeen called home for what could prove to be a pivotal moment in humanhistory. You recruited her. Obviously, you were mistaken. We can't be sure what she told them. Anyway, I'm more concernedwith why she turned away from us. And what about you? Yes. You've spent as much time with that child as she did. This isn't anyone else. This is an abomination. And when thetime comes, it will be treated as such. Well, I'm going tomiss this place. The simplicity. There's no middle ground here and Ican see the Earth. Send in Greaves on your way out. Tell them I appreciate their hard work. There's one other thing. A loose end that needs tying up. Puttogether a group, have them meet me at the third junction in, say, onehour. The Third World War had just ended and the cease-fire wasbarely three years old. Colonel Green. One of many men history has misunderstood. Before my father died and left me inthis facility, I was studying to be a historian. Until I had a veryverbal confrontation with a certain professor who claimed that Greenwas nothing more than a genocidal madman. Green euthanised hundreds of thousands who were afflicted withradiation damage. Their millions of descendants would've enduredhorrible disease, yet history, history never says anything about thatsuffering that Greene prevented. Makes me wonder if I'll be remembered with any more accuracy. Really? Sometimes, I'm not certain I understand myself. I'm sure Greene told himself the same thing. Daniel, you are a wise man. That's wonderful. Wonderful. Thank you. It's not worth it, Romeo. Juliet's in good hands. The twostar-crossed lovers. I can't help but wonder whether your little dramawill end happier than that famous double suicide in a medieval tomb. John Frederick Paxton. I run this facility. You're right there, Commander. My mining business is about totake a turn for the worse. Daniel, get started. Behind this? No. I lead this, and proudly too. Before you ask,your child is safe and sound, finally sleeping through the night. Iforgot how much trouble a newborn can be. No. And no is a word that Starfleet better get used to hearingfrom now on. Because up until today, it's always been yes, hasn't it? Yes, yes, go right ahead. roam the stars. Yes, inform potentiallyhostile species of the whereabouts of Earth. Yes, entrust the entirefuture of our world to non-human creatures who don't even feel like wedo. Yes, promote the total degradation of mankind by encouragingalien-human relations. Well, yes is a word that ends here and now. I'mreturning Earth to its rightful owners. I am giving Earth back tohumanity, back to human beings. It is my life's work. It is what I wasborn to do, and there is no one, not an alien, not a human, that willstop me from achieving it. My father designed this facility. He knewthat mining was an unpredictable business. Mines tap out, veins dry up. Go to launch mode, Daniel. You're an engineer. I think you'llappreciate this. Take a good long look. For you, this'll be like a walk across the street. Lock it up. You better hang onto something. She gets a little rusty out ofthe gate. Ignore them. Reactor status? A five second burst. I plan on luck. Go. That was a magnificent piece of flying, Daniel. Impress me again. Let's see it. Tie us in. Let's take in the view. This is where itall begins. Josiah. My name is John Frederick Paxton. I've justtaken over the verteron array on Mars. I can now fire on any ship orfacility in the system. I have no intention of using this weapon again,provided that every single non-human in our system leaves immediately. A new era is at hand, an era that will expose the concept ofinterspecies unity as an absolute and vicious lie. An era that willwitness the adventof a human-centred consciousness that will place our world before allothers. As of this moment, mankind casts off the shackles of alieninterference and now determines its own fate. Terra Prime forever.

17858,ENT,episode 94,SAMUELS,"Having endured a catastrophic World War, Earth's governmentscame to this city for the purpose of creating a just and lasting peaceamong nations. Today, we have assembled here again, representatives ofnumerous worlds, to forge an unprecedented alliance. With thisCoalition of Planets, we seek to strengthen our bonds of friendship,render permanent the peace that now exists among us for the ongoingexploration of our galaxy. Let us dedicate ourselves to these worthygoals so that future generations can look back upon this moment withpride and eternal gratitude. Thank you. I hope I didn't embarrass myself too much. Call me Nathan. I want to thank you again for attending. Having Enterprise here seems to put everyone at ease. People feelcomfortable in the presence of heroes. Well, it certainly helps that the delegates can understandeach other. These universal translators work perfectly, thanks to you. Whatever you did, they're extremely precise. Though, when I'mlistening to the Tellarite ambassador, I wish they were just a littleless precise. I've always believed that formidable goals produce formidableresults. Fortunately, the news hasn't spread to the general public, andI'd like to keep it that way. An announcement of this nature could derail the conference. You haven't spent much time on Earth lately. After the Xindiattack, there was a dangerous increase in xenophobia. It died down somewhat, but not completely. There are stillpeople out there who want us to stay in our little corner of thegalaxy. The news of a Vulcan-human hybrid could inflame them, give themsomething to rally against. As I said, you've been away for a while. Can't afford to operate on faith. There's more at stake herethan a simple trade agreement. You fought the Xindi. You know betterthan anyone how Earth's survival depends on alliances with otherspecies. We don't have the Vulcans watching our backs anymore. All I'm saying is that there's strength in numbers. I'm sure they are, but I've heard nothing new. Starfleet investigators are more than capable of handlingthis. I suggest we let them do their job. I'll notify you the moment Ihear something. I appreciate your co-operation. The Tellarites are pushing for an embargoagainst the Orions. They claim they've been attacking their freighters. You have to appreciate their point of view. Ambassador, Captain Archer. How can I help you? Why come to me? I can't do that. I'm sorry. If that's true, it's extremely troubling. It seems you're doing fairly well investigating on your own. I've already explained why there was a need for secrecy. I wasvery young when I joined Terra Prime. Didn't you make any questionable choices when you were thatage, Captain? It was a stupid mistake. I was a fool. My father had diedin a freighter accident and I blamed the pilot, who happened to beDenobulan. We all have our demons. I've exorcised mine. I underestimated you. I suppose I'm not the first person tomake that mistake. You'll have your case file within the hour."
17859,ENT,episode 94,CORIDAN,We have traded with the Orions for centuries. We would'veknown of these attacks. This is Tellarite slander. The Tellarites only want to deprive us of valuable commerce.

Get a transporter lockon the baby and T'Pol. Get us out of here. Damage? We'll consider ourselves warned. Set a course to Earth. Paxton's holding two of my officers hostageat the array. We can't attack it. It's not just the hostages. Any attack on the array willtrigger a massive explosion that could kill thousands of colonists. I'll take in a small team. We'll break into the facility andstop them. If he can't see us, he can't destroy us. Comet Burke, deflected by the array eightyears ago. Set to hit the north pole of Mars at dawn. Enterprise will destroy the array as ordered. Bridge to Engineering. We're coming up on the comet. All right, Travis, let's hitch a ride to Mars. Keep the sensors locked on the array. Themoment it powers up I remember when you used to jump every time the engineshiccupped. Don't get too used to that chair. I'm going to want it back. Thirty minutes to the atmosphere. We're picking up ionisation from the upper atmosphere. Hull plating's offline. Hull temperature climbing! We're comingin too hot. Five seconds to impact. Â REED Get close to that ridge line. The verteron array is on the other side of that rise. We'llhead through there. The guard's still walking away. Where's T'Pol? Enterprise has orders to destroy the complex. Step away from the controls. Archer to Enterprise. We're inside the control room. Shut it down. The room's depressurising. Get Malcolm out of here! Go! That might've worked for the moon, but the galaxy's a lot morecrowded than we thought. It's an opportunity. It's over, Paxton. With a little help from you. It's Archer. Are you still with Samuels? Is Ensign Masaro there? We think Masaro may be working for TerraPrime. Samuels may be in danger. Reed and Mayweather are on their way. You don't want to do this. Give me the phase pistol. That's an order. Ensign. Ensign! I know. Up until about a hundred years ago, there was one question thatburned in every human, that made us study the stars and dream oftraveling to them, Are we alone? Our generation is privileged to knowthe answer to that question. We are all explorers, driven to knowwhat's over the horizon, what's beyond our own shores. And yet, themore I've experienced, the more I've learned that no matter how far wetravel, or how fast we get there, the most profound discoveries are notnecessarily beyond that next star. They're within us, woven into thethreads that bind us,all of us, to each other. The final frontier begins in this hall. Let'sexplore it together."

If we hit him, it'lltake out half of Utopia colony He's targeted us with the array. Apparently, they don't likebeing scanned. Massive power surge! We've lost half our relays. The beam wasonly two percent of the array's total output. He could have vaporisedus. I don't like it any more than you do. You know the situation. And you're going to tell me how. How does that help us? According to this, if we keep our altitude less than ten metresabove the surface, Paxton won't see us. That part's taken care of, without your help. I've got quite enough to keep me busy on Enterprise. Indeed? Well, then I imagine this'll be the last time we meet. Compared to penetrating Xindi defenses, this'll be a walk in thepark. We're ready for you in the launch bay. Captain. What's wrong with the inertial dampeners? Start? I've already had the maximum dosage. What was that? At this speed? The closer we get, the more we risk being spotted by Paxton'ssensors. Thirty-two. This is the thirty second planet I've set foot on. Ten metres. There's another guard approaching. If he powers it up It does seem a bit coincidental. It could've been knocked loose by an impact. On your feet, sir. Shuttlepod One was sabotaged. We nearly crashed!

17873,ENT,episode 95,T'POL,"Previously, on Enterprise. ] I'venever been pregnant, Trip. Her medical readings appear normal. How did you obtain our genetic material? The child is a binaryclone. Human and Vulcan genes produced this child, which indicates ourtwo species have more similarities than differences. She's not a threat. Neither of our species is what it was a million years ago, norwhat it'll become in the future. Life is change. I won't let you hurt her. What does that mean? Hello. I'm your mother. You're going to need a name. We shoulddiscuss that with your father. In private. You and I both know that's not true. My daughter's ill. You will arrange for medical care at once. You will provide immediate transport for my child, CommanderTucker, and myself. The hospital at Utopia Colony will be suitableuntil Enterprise arrives. This. Taggart's Syndrome. Since you obviously didn't die by agetwenty, you're receiving treatment. Rigelian gene therapy? The very thing you're warning humans to avoid is what's keepingyou alive. Alien knowledge, freely shared. You're not only a terrorist,you're a hypocrite. Colonel Green also said, to be human is to be pure.

Enterprise isreturning to Earth. Paxton is in custody, but the consequences of hisactions continue to affect us all. Elizabeth. Her name is Elizabeth. Come in. She was important."
17874,ENT,episode 95,TUCKER,"Then how do you explain all this? She's not an it. They'd need cells from both of us. Someone on Enterprise helped you? Who? I'm listening. You really think I'm going to help you turn that array into aweapon? You know, I never used to like Vulcans all that much myself. They always seemed so smug. Making us jump through hoops for everylittle advance in warp technology, and they knew the answers all along. So what was it with you? The ears? The fact that they're vegetarian? Well, you can't deny that. We didn't make contact with the Vulcans until ten years afterthe war. Is that the kind of paranoid crap Paxton's been feeding you? You ever actually met a Vulcan? If you got to know some, actually took the time to talk withone Okay. Where're T'Pol and the baby? I am finished. I don't know what you're talking about. I told you I'd make modifications to your ship-- not yourweapon. I don't care what you need. You told Starfleet when you're planning to fire the array. Andyou don't think they're going to blast this facility off the face ofthe planet? A Mark Three interlock. Took you long enough. Crew quarters, but Paxton's getting ready to fire the array. Main controls are in there. Plasma grid, control panel. Looks like Paxton's aim was off. Maybe a little. I guess we shouldn't keep calling her she. My sister would've liked that. Is there anything you can do? The delegates at the conference, they'veasked about the service for, for Elizabeth. They want to attend. There's something else. I spoke with Phlox. It turns out therewas a flaw in the technique that Paxton's doctors used in the cloningprocess. Human and Vulcan DNA, Phlox says there's no medical reasonwhy they can't combine. So if a Vulcan and a human ever decided to havea child, it'd probably be okay. And that's sort of comforting. Transcriberspersonal note - with a slightrearrangement of the final scenes, it is my opinion that Enterpriseshould have ended with Archer's speech. The next episode is totallymissable, unwarranted, and frankly even worse than Spock's Brain. Andthat's saying something when you're a life-long Trek fan asI am. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Two hundred and forty eight. It appears my initial prognosis was incorrect. It's genetic. HerVulcan and human aren't compatible. I'm attempting to stabilise her nucleotides, but there's neverbeen a child like her. I wish I could do more. When you invited me to join this crew, I thought it would be aninteresting diversion for a few months. Some time away from thecomplications of family, which on Denobula can be extremelycomplicated. I didn't expect to gain another family. It hurts as if she were my own child. Make something good come fromthis, Captain."

Actually, I can only be relieved by a higher ranking officer inmy chain of command. Belay that order. I won't risk exposing our position by breakingradio silence. I know what I'm doing. Take us in. Full impulse. Charge weapons. Go ahead, Captain. Standing by. They really want to postpone the conference? Excuse me, sir. Sato, go ahead. We're in the mess hall. No, I don't see him, sir.

If you were an S. I. agent, you'd be out of this Brig with onecall to your division head. Mayweather, Go ahead. On my way. You know I'm going to tell the Captain about this. Probably not. Why are you telling me this now? So you're revealing all of this because you're worried aboutme. I'm touched. You're not going to manipulate me again. Goodbye. Hull plating's steady at ninety four percent. We need to maintain an erratic flight profile, so we look likea chunk of the comet. I'm taking us closer to the nucleus. It's going to startgetting a little rough. The gravity's starting to tear the cometapart. The engine shut down, but there were no warning lights. Theconsole's locked up. Bypassing auto flight control. Switching to manual! We're out of options. Ground proximity? I was thinking the same thing. You'll want to keep your armsinside the vehicle at all times. Hmm? Commander. I can't figure out why the console lockedup at the same time the engines shut down. Flight control and engine power are routed separately. untilthey reach that junction. The panel's open. If ionised gas got in here,it could've melted the primary circuits of both systems. No. It's been forced. This was deliberate. Is this your signature? It's a first step. The Captain says it's going to take years towork out the details. Just doing my job. I know. A lot of details to work out. The least I can do is give you a ride. The Launch Bay's this way."

No one can get within athousand kilometres of the verteron array without being detected. What makes you think I even have that information? Because your section routinely thinks about the unthinkable. Andbecause you'd never miss a chance to put me in your debt. You're a good judge of character. The grid was designed tofunction in the planet's original atmosphere, but terraforming's madethe air much thicker. Sections of the grid continually need re-calibration and are prone tofalse signals. You can exploit that weakness. The good news is, withterraforming there's no more need for pressure suits in the lowland. Oxygen, yes. Thermal garments You'll still need to reach the surface undetected. So, the student has surpassed the teacher. When you're finishedwith Mars, why don't you come work for me? And if Archer's coalition is formed, Enterprise could be busierthan ever. Always the optimist. Good luck, Malcolm."

You obviously did more than talk. And look at what you got foryour trouble. Some half-human thing. Go ahead. You're a traitor. A traitor to humanity. I'll be outside. Co-ordinates locked in."
18252,ENT,episode 95,GANNET,"Thank you for seeing me. I never got my lawyer. Apparently, he's busy. I don't work for Terra Prime. I work for StarfleetIntelligence. You are not the only one who wants to serve his people. And then everyone on Enterprise would know who I am, includingthe real Terra Prime operative. He won't believe you. You're going after Paxton. If someone on Enterprise is workingfor him, he could know you're coming. Yes. Travis, wait! I hear the conference is back on track. But it'll happen, and you're part of the reason why. So was I. If Vulcans and Andorians can get along, you'd think we could. Isn't that the fast way home?"

18255,ENT,episode 95,PAXTON,"It'salmost possible to forget what she represents. I'm returning Earth to its rightful owners. I've just taken over the verteron array onMars. I can now fire on any ship or facility in the system. I have no intention of using this weapon again,provided that every single non-human in our system leaves immediately. I know there will be questions. We've been dealing with non-humans foralmost a century. Judge the evidence for yourselves. The citizen soldiers of Terra Prime will act toprotect you against the most dangerous enemy that humanity has everfaced. Do not be deceived. This is noordinary, innocent child. This is an alien-human hybrid. Living proofof what will happen if we allow ourselves to be submerged in aninterstellar coalition. Our genetic heritage Terra Prime is dedicated tothe protection of life in all of its diversity. So for the next twentyfour hours, we guarantee safe passage to all aliensleaving our solar system. So long as non-humans keep to their ownworlds, But if any alien, if one single alien remainsafter the deadline, Terra Prime will defend the sovereignty of everysingle human being And we will begin by destroying the institution whoseblind arrogance and moral cowardice have put us all at risk. StarfleetCommand. We do not seek war, but if the aliens do not leave, and forceus to fight, I make this solemn promise to all of the sons anddaughters of Earth. Our future will be secure because humanity willprevail. It's unharmed, just as I said. There's nothing normal about it. The medical freezers on your ship hold bio-samples from yourentire crew. Terra Prime has supporters everywhere. I've let you see your daughter. That's my half of the bargain. Now it's your turn. I need to make modifications on my ship. I need you to refine my targeting system. You really think I'm going to give you a choice? All the rocking in the world will not make that child Vulcan orhuman. Don't you realise that baby is, That baby isas much a threat to your species as it is to mine? That child is a cross-breed freak. How many generations beforeour genome is so diluted that the word human is nothing more than afootnote in some medical text? The same thing could happen to yourpeople, or don't you care about that? Change in this case means extinction, and I, for one, will notlet that baby bring humanity to that point. I won't have to. There's nothing aliens like better than tosee us fighting one another. They're together. You'll eat as soon as you finish your work. All you've done is try to sabotage the targeting system. Please. I've been monitoring your work from the control centre. To be honest, I'd have been disappointed if you hadn't tried tosabotage the array. But you did, which proves you're a man ofprinciple. That is why I know you're going to refine the array just asyou promised. In two hours I am going to fire a verteron beam directly atStarfleet Command. Now, with this targeting system the way it is, Iwill hit Starfleet but I'll also take out half of San Francisco alongwith it. I need a scalpel, not a bludgeon. Starfleet's been warned, if that's what concerns you. Now youcan either help me, and a few empty buildings will be destroyed, or yourefuse me, and millions may die. If you are so eager for a bloodbath, a bloodbath is what youwill get. Put him in detention. And make sure he has a news screen. Iwant him to see the bodies when they start to pull them from therubble. I'm told you have something to say to me. I keep no secrets from my men. Josiah, give us the room. No one leaves this facility. What, have you been inhaling the atmosphere? What makes youthink you can dictate terms to me? You're not a doctor. This is not the time for timidity and second guessing. Wecannot afford to doubt ourselves. I'm not the first significant leader who failed to measure upto his own ideal. History will determine that! So go ahead, tell my followerswhat you wish. See if they take the word of an alien over mine. What'swrong with your child? Well, its two halves are warring with one another. Alien andhuman. Conflict was inevitable.Â He Josiah. Your child and the Coalition of Planets, both doomed from thebeginning. I never expected them to comply. Let's get this done. Josiah, begin the firing sequence. Jonathan Archer, the man who delivered us from the Xindi. Well,look at you now. I know the reason you turned your back on humanity. I blameyour father. He wanted the secrets of warp technology so badly, heallowed the Vulcans to turn him into their pet human. And you, well,the sins of the father. My father never asked anything from anyone. His miningoperations transformed the moon from a mere colony into a completelyself-sufficient world, and that is how we should go to the stars. Taking the worlds we need and taming them, with human hands, and humanminds, and human souls. That's not our problem. We're each his father's child. I've been a miner all my life. You get used to the low oxygen. I've locked the sequence. You can't stop it from firing. I'velocked it! Terra Prime, forever."
18256,ENT,episode 95,SAMUELS,"Today we have assembled representatives ofnumerous worlds to forge an unprecedented alliance. I want that transmission blocked. Then find some way to contact Enterprise. I want to speak toArcher. Ifyou'll excuse me. Ambassador? Isolated incidents, I'm sure. Paxton's a fanatic, but he's a man of his word. He won't actbefore his deadline's up. The Council's aware of that. If you can't bring yourself tofire on them, another Captain can be assigned to Enterprise. No onewill think less of you. This wasn't an easy decision for the Council. The potentialfor disaster's even greater than you think. Over the next thirtymonths, the terraforming project has fourteen comets set to collidewith Mars. Without the array to divert them toward the polar caps, thecomets could hit anywhere, even the domed cities. Paxton can destroy any ship that approaches Mars. You're not serious. But that's only fourteen hours from now. What happens if thisplan of yours doesn't work? Paxton's deadline is up. We have to facean unpleasant reality. Captain Archer's mission's failed. Two minutes? I'm not prepared to take that chance. Your estimates could bewrong. I understand your reluctance. I'm giving you new orders. Do it now. I can have you relieved of duty. Open a channel to Admiral Gardner. You're risking the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. You're out of time. Destroy the complex now. Give the order! Postpone is a diplomatic way of saying it's dead. Paxton'sunnerved them, and there's not a lot I've been able to say to changetheir minds. Fellow delegates, this last week we've seen what humans can beat their worst. But we cannot, we must not use that as an excuse to endthe dream that began here. For then, the demons of our past will havewon. Instead, I want to look to the future and begin by honouring thepeople responsible for our being here tonight. They represent all of usat our best."

One thing at a time. After the charter's signed, I'll give himwhatever he needs to put Enterprise in mothballs. That's impossible. Shran's been dead forwhat, three years? Including me. I remember. But this isn't a good time, Shran. I assume youknow where we're heading. It's more than a proposal. We're on our way to Earth to signthe charter. I'm afraid a detour is out of the question right now. You never told me you had a child. Who? Set a rendezvous course. I still don't understand why you left. You were a hero. Why would you fake your own death? Your friends found you? Then give them what they want. But you have a plan. I'm familiar with it. He said he fell in with some disreputable people. That doesn'tmake him a criminal. If Shran hadn't helped us, I never would've gotten aboard theXindi weapon. Have you forgotten that? This alliance is based onfriendship and loyalty, exactly what Shran is looking for right now. You don't trust Andorians. You never have. Thank God the VulcanCouncil is a little more enlightened than you are. If they're willingto forge an alliance with Andoria, the least you can do is give Shranthe benefit of the doubt. When we met ten years ago, I didn't trustyou. For that matter, I didn't trust any Vulcans. You helped me getpast that, remember? I listened to you, now it's your turn to listen tome. I can't turn my back on him, T'Pol. Try to understand. By the way, drop by the galley when you get a moment. Chef'strying to come up with a menu for our last dinner together. He wants toknow everybody's favourite dish. Just go see him, all right? Don't worry. Chef's promised at least six kinds of cheese. How reliable are your sources? How many do you expect to show up? Move into a stationary orbit. Put a team together. Meet us in the Launch bay. Well, that's flattering. I appreciate you worrying about me, but I'll be fine. Rigel was the first place we visited, remember? Now it's goingto be the last. Poetic justice. Why should you have all the fun? Archer to Shuttlepod Two. Shran's made contact. Everything's set. I'll lead you in. Hold on! Any time. I'll feel more comfortable getting you away from your friendsat warp four. All the same, you'll be under your own power by tomorrow night. We'll contact your wife and tell her to expect you the next morning. You're welcome. You should let Phlox take a look at her beforeyou go to your quarters. I'm glad I didn't take your advice about not coming along. Signing documents are easy. Training a new engineer, that canbe a real pain in the ass. We'd better hope so. There are thousands of planets withinreach. Got to start somewhere. The Tellarites were never big fans of the Andorians, either. This is a special bottle of whiskey. Zefram Cochrane gave it to myfather the day they broke ground at the warp five complex. Here's to the next generation. I always crammed before exams. I've got three days left. It's the biggest day of our lives. Archer to the Bridge. What's going on? Who are they? Remind me to mention that to Shran. Shran left six hours ago. You're too late. I'll take care of this. I gave you an order, Commander. Trip! That's enough. Trip, that's enough! Trip? Doctor. I know, Trip. Just take it easy. Everything's all right. No. We'll be right on schedule. I'll even have time to write myspeech. Need any help? For his parents? I told them I thought Trip wouldn't want it any other way. Don't forget this. His parents? They're a little eccentric. I think you'll see where Trip gothis sense of humour. I remember. Time heals all wounds, but absence makes the heart grow fonder. I guess it's a little tricky. Emotions have a way of contradictingthemselves. When I took command ten years ago, I saw myself as an explorer. I thought all the riskswould be worth it because, just beyond the next planet, just beyond thenext star, there would be something magnificent, something noble. Andnow Trip is dead, and I have to give a speech about how worthwhile it'sall been. You sound like my ninth grade teacher. I'll be proud of myself if I get this speech out in one piece. I know what you meant, Phlox, and I appreciate it, but this isnot about me. Thank you, Doctor. You'd better get out there. You don't want to miss me screwingthis thing up. You never did like crowds, did you? To boldly go where no man has gone before. <Backto the episode listingStarTrek Â® is copyright of CBSStudios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

If you recall, Rigel Ten is filled with avery unsavoury element. And I rather doubt Shran's scheme will be quiteas simple as he claims. I don't like it. What exactly are you doing? Well, what's the point? This ship will be joining the mothballfleet next week. All good things. Captain thinks there'll be another Enterprisebefore too long. It won't be the same. Stand still and you won't be harmed. He was anything but tactful. What his countrymen might refer toas a hick. For the life of me, I couldn't understand what Captain Archer saw inhim. Yeah, right. That's about it, really. I used to think that first impressionsmeant something. I guess it's not always true. To be honest, I didn'tthink he was going to last a month, old friend of the Captain's or not. And now, I can't imagine what these last ten years would've been likewithout him. Are you certain these are the right seats? They don't seem very to me. From this distance you can't tell an Andorian from a Tellarite. I'll bet you a month's pay he'll be on the bridge of a new ship. He won't be able to resist one of those warp seven beauties. It's very wise of you to stick with him. That's exactly what Iplan to do."
18270,ENT,episode 96,ALIEN,"Stop there. Unless I'm mistaken, I thought you had no idea wherethe amethyst was. Funny how a missing child has a way to jog the memory, eh,Shran? I thought you were happily married. Who's the Vulcan? Put the case down and open it. I could shoot you both. You let a female negotiate for you, eh, Shran? Now open the case. Set it down. Now, back up. Fine, but you stay. One step, and this little blue beauty won'thave a father to come home to. Now step back. Â ALIEN We've come for Shran and the child. You're leaving me very little choice. You're lying. His shuttle is still in your launch bay. Kill him. Very well. Turn around, both of you. Stop. You can't expect me to just leavehim here alive? Stay here. If we're not back in ten minutes, killhim. Take me to Shran or I'll kill him right now. Be very careful. As long as you keep your hands where we can see them. Stop. Open it for him. If there's a weapon in there, you'regoing to die before your Captain. Proceed. Hurry up. You're running out of time."

18272,ENT,episode 96,T'POL,"He's working on it now. Undoubtedly. Captain, Admiral Douglas is asking you to approve thedecommission protocols. He's an admitted criminal. You said soyourself. If we're late for the ceremony, it will have far-reachingconsequences. I don't trust him. I'll try. There are eighty three crewmembers aboard. I appreciate the gesture, but it's notnecessary to prepare a special dish for me. In that case, I prefer to be surprised. We have already lost five hours picking up Shran's shuttle. Nowwe're going to lose at least another day diverting our course to Rigel. Is there anything aboard this ship you don't know? His compassion has gotten us into trouble on many occasions. Wecould miss this ceremony. Thank you. Excuse me? I spent the morning with him, recalibrating the plasma array. If you're referring to our intimate relationship, that's beenover for six years. I'm Vulcan. I don't miss people. Trip rarely questions the Captain's decisions. He's not. He simply tends to agree with the Captain most of thetime. He trusts him. Before I joined this crew, I never could have imagined anythingmore important than following orders. Humans believe that sometimes you have to follow your instincts. A very illogical approach, but one I've come to embrace. The photograph you gave us had poor resolution, but I'mconfident our replication will look authentic. They'll need a spectral micrometer to see it's a fabrication. Have you been down to see Chef yet? He talked about you. Us. It's not important. Do you ever miss me? Yes. That's not what I asked you. I haven't thought about those days in a long time. After speaking with Chef, I realised we may never see each otheragain. We're taking different assignments. There's no way of knowing. However long it may be, I believe I'm going to miss you. We want the child first. You'll never get this case open, I promise you. We're under attack, sir. A small vessel. We don't know yet. Intruder alert. No, thank you. Will they still be coming to the ceremony? I'd like to meet them. Yes. I'd like to meet them. My mother was somewhat eccentric, as well. Trip told me as the years went by that I would miss her less. But he was wrong, because I find myself missing her more. Why would hetell me that? And you wonder why we suppress them. Trip would be the first to say it was worthwhile. Please stand still. If you hadn't waited until the last minute,you would have had time to memorise your speech. Why do so many humans refuse to take credit where credit is due? There are times when modesty and humility are quite illogical. I'm going to remain down here, if you don't mind. You look very heroic."
18273,ENT,episode 96,TUCKER,"I can't imagine the Captain would put us in jeopardy this closeto signing the charter. These injectors need to be purged every six months. Are thedeuterium filters clear? Make it quick. I pretty much built this engine. Plan to take care of it aslong as I can. Been a hell of a run, Malcolm. never thought it wouldcome to an end. I imagine. That's okay. Come on. Captain, can I have a word with you? We can handle this without you. You know what I mean. You've got the biggest day of your lifecoming up. A lot of people are counting on you being there. You don't need to be putting yourself in harm's way. I'mtelling you, we can take care of it. First thing this morning. You? Me? What about us? Why'd you bring it up, then? You mean? You know how long it's been? Well. Yeah, I guess, sometimes. Benefit of being a Vulcan. What are you talking about? There's every way of knowing. I can guarantee you we're notgoing to lose touch. Stop thinking like that. Thanks, boss. You must be getting tired of saving my life. Yeah, you and me both. Then again, you almost got yourselfkilled down there. Wouldn't have gone over too big at the ceremony. So do you think this alliance is going to hold? Who would have guessed? Vulcans and Andorians in the same bed. And here we are, toasting to warp seven. Written your speech yet? The biggest day of your life, and you're going to wait untilthe night before. I hate to contradict you, Captain. You're the man they'rewaiting to see. I thought you said their ship couldn't catch up to us. Hold on. Wait a minute. The hell you will. I'll bring you to Shran. I know where he is. You heard me. I said I'd bring you to Shran. Hey, this guy's the Captain. He's my boss. If I'm going to disobey his order, I don't wanthim coming along. Listen. I won't do this if you kill him, but could you pleaseshut him up? He's out cold. He's not going to cause any trouble. Didn't you hear what I just said? I won't help you if you killhim. This might take longer than ten minutes. Okay, okay! I've got a better idea. I'll bring Shran to us. Wedon't have to go anywhere. You can all come see foryourselves. This is just a comm. station. I'm going to need to open this so I can bypass the securityprotocols. Is that okay? No problem. Now, all I need to do is connect this to therelay inside that panel. Satisfied? There's just one other thing I need to tell you. You can allgo straight to hell. Sorry about therifle-butt. I was just trying to We gonna be late? Great news. Wait till they hear Fried catfish with hush puppies. Keep in mind, within a week I'll be eating the real thing. I'mtaking my folks down to Mobile. Captain asked for meat loaf, didn't he? How about T'Pol? She won't be very co-operative. You wait andsee. Can you believe it? We all thought he was dead and gone. You mean, getting back to San Francisco? Nah, he won't letanything get in the way of that. Trust me. Can you spare one of thosecarrots? That's okay. You know, he'd never admit it, butthis thing means a hell of a lot to him. He's real proud to be one ofthe people signing this charter. And he ought to be. I can count on one hand the number of people I trust. I don'tmean trust like I trust you aren't lying to me or, I trust you won'tsteal my money. I'm talking about the kind of trust where you knowsomeone's not going to hurt you, no matter what. Where you know they'llalways be there for you, no matter how bad things get. You ever knowanybody like that? Well, I got some packing to do before I go back on duty. Youfigured out what you're going to do? You gonna sign on to another ship, or are you gonna open upthat little restaurant in the Berkshires you told me about? Nope.

One time, he became so exhaustedI had to demand he get six hours sleep. He negotiated it down to four. A very stubborn young man. I quite enjoythis. Didn't have a choice. Add two percent syntho-surfactant. The plasma was super-heated. It thermalised his lungs. Initialise the hyperbaric sequencer. We need to get him into the chamber now! Clear! There are dignitaries here from eighteen different worlds. It'sa good sign. I wouldn't be surprised if this alliance begins to expandbefore we know it. You should be very proud of yourself, Captain.

I may no longer be a member of the ImperialGuard, but I'm aware of the proposed coalition. The ceremony isn't for three days. If my planworks, you'll be home in plenty of time. My child's been abducted! Kidnapped. You owe me. Jhamel gave birth five years ago. A daughter. They've taken her. Former associates. It's a long story. You needto let me come aboard. Who would've thought civilian life would bemore dangerous than commanding a ship for the Imperial Guard. A hero with a family. I always believed that change was a goodthing. I was a fool. I made some poor choices. Picked the wrong friends. Peopleinvolved in questionablebusiness ventures. They think I took something that belonged to them. With the help of some old colleagues from the Guard, I managed to makemyself disappear. It worked for nearly three years. Six months ago. I've been on the move ever since. They took herin the middle of the night. I was in the next room, asleep. Useless! It's been a week. They say if I don't return what's theirs, they'llkill her. I don't have it! I never did. It cost me everything I had, but I managed to find out wherethey've taken her. They're on a trading outpost, Rigel Ten. I know these men quite well, Captain. I can outwit them, I'vedone it before. But I'll need at least seven men. You have to help me. It's my little girl. They're criminals, but honourable ones. They promised me thatTalla's being held here at Upper Level Four. Have you fashioned theamethyst? The Tenebian amethyst they think I stole was flawless. They'llundoubtedly have magnifying equipment with them. Where's my daughter? Where is she? I'm not interested in your associates, so don't question mine. You heard her. Are you all right? Let her take the girl. I want you to go with T'Pol. You'll be safe with her. She'llfind you something to eat. Obey your father. You're certain it won't be a problem? My shuttle may be slow, but their ships can barely make warptwo. I told you my plan would only take a few hours. Whatever you say, Captain."

With the unexpected arrival of Admiral Pressman, myold CO, I find myself in an awkward position. Counsellor Troi hassuggested I might get a few insights by calling up an historicholo-programme. I've told you everything I can. Not a promise. An order. Not yet. I've gone back a couple of days earlier to get aperspective. But I really don't seehow this is going to help. Reed's shorter than I thought he'd be. No, I'm sure it's fine. It's just, you expect larger than lifepeople to be larger than life. Not yet. Why? I'll keep that in mind. You bet. I'll give you an update. Computer, freeze programme. Advance ahead one hour. Switch toobjective mode. Come on. I've already started to reduce theplomeek broth. All I need to know is which roots you prefer. Pull up a chair. I could use the company. I heard a rumour I maybe whipping up some Andorian cabbage soup tonight. His child's in danger. Jonathan is a compassionate man. You should know that by now. Don't worry. I've got a hunch you're going to make it. Tea? Phlox has giving me his largest Edosian suckerfish. Looks like a catfish. I'm hoping it tastes like one. CommanderTucker's crazy for catfish. Do you ever miss him? That's not what I mean. But the question remains, do you miss him? Sorry, I forgot. Is he as concerned as you are about making thisceremony? He doesn't strike me as someone who follows orders blindly. Would you peel these for me? And now? Computer, freeze programme. Thanks. Someone I knew. Phil Wallace. Hell of a handball player. Pressman was gettingready to promote him. Seventy one. All but nine of us. What difference does it make? Seventy one people died. You're the empath. Why don't you tell me? Why don't we change the subject? Okay? They picked up the Andorian. They're on their way to Rigel Ten. I took your advice about the Chef. You were right. T'Pol openedup to me. No, I haven't made it to Engineering yet. Have you spent anytime on the NX-01? What about the ship itself? Now's your chance. Come on down with me. I'll get you back in plenty of time. Come on. Our brig is bigger than this. No fish tank. Allow me. He does have a dog, though. Porthos. No seat for the First Officer? Kirk's ship had them, I think. Engineering's down this way. Computer, add an appropriate crew complement, objective mode. Don't get any ideas. Yeah, for a little while. Computer, how long before they reach Rigel Ten? Advance to that point. Stay in objective mode. I know it's past office hours. It won't be long before they find the Pegasus. They rescued the Andorian's daughter. I need you to promise you'll keep this confidential. What do you know about the Treaty of Algeron? It also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on Starfleetvessels. A secret group in Starfleet Security developed a prototype. Pressman was put in charge of testing it. The accident, the seventy one people who died, we were testingthe cloaking device. The nine of us who made it back alive were sworn to secrecy. They want to pick the experiment up where they left off. Pressman told me himself. What they're doing is wrong. It couldjeopardise the treaty. I took an oath of secrecy. Pressman still outranks the Captain. I wish I was. Thinner. Roll it a little bit thinner, like this. Go on. Did you ever find yourself attracted to him? Always do. Captain said they'd known each other a long time. You're pressing too hard. Just slow, steady movement. No need to apologise. Did Trip ever take a swing at Picard? Archer, Captain Archer? Don't let it get too big. Now fold it over. There you go. To relax? If I remember correctly, that's when So did he follow your orders? You've always got a choice. {Captain's mess] Obviously, the Captain mentioned why I wanted to see you. Nothing like a challenge. I haven't spoken to him yet. I've already started her plomeek broth. All she has to do ischoose a few final ingredients. She'll be down here in about an hour. Ihear we're on our way to pick up Shran. Don't you think the Captain's cutting it a little close? They're not peeled yet. You sound like a lifetime member of the Jonathan Archer fanclub. Yeah. One or two. Do? You know, I haven't decided yet. You got any advice? Wouldn't you be? I think I'm ready to talk to Captain Picard. I should have doneit a long time ago. I guess we are. Computer, end programme."
18662,ENT,episode 96,TROI,"You're sure you don't want to talk about whathappened? If it's a question of breaking a promise. Have you learned anything on the Holodeck about breaking orders? That's why you run a starship and I'm a counsellor. Maybe the programme's off. Has the Andorian hailed them? You might want to leap ahead to that point. It's where thingsstart really happening. And you should consider taking over the Galley. Well, Starfleet ships didn't have counsellors in those days, butthe Chef on the first Enterprise came pretty close. I read almosteverybody confided in him. Supper? Okay. There you are. Someone you know? Pegasus? How many died? How do you feel about learning the ship wasn't destroyed? You're feeling guilty. You think in some way you wereresponsible? I think it's something else. Something about seeing that shipagain. Okay. How did things go on the Holodeck? I was referring to any insight you may have gained. Have you met with Commander Tucker? I've never run the programme. I think I went when I was a little girl, but I get all thosemuseum ships mixed up. I have an appointment in an hour. A lot of things change in two hundred years. Watch yourself! How could Archer survive without a fish tank? Right, I remember. One of the Musketeers. Ooh, comfy. Perhaps Archer wasn't as fussy as Captain Picard when it came topeople sitting in his chair. I remember seeing one of these in a photograph. There's something lonely about a ship without its crew. That's better. It's sad. Commander Tucker had no idea he wouldn't make it back. Computer, freeze programme. He's cute. Reg'll be furious if I'm late. Are you going to stay? Good luck. Computer, Arch. Yes, Data. Can I give you a rain check? Data, I'll get back to you. Come in. What is it? You haven't made your decision. The holodeck? So you're coming to the moment of truth in there, as well. You know I will. 2311. It redefined the Romulan Neutral Zone. The Pegasus? That's why they're so eager to find it before the Romulans do. It was covered up. And you've lived with that for twelve years? Are you sure? And you want to tell that to Captain Picard. Will, you didn't get this far in your career making easydecisions. I'm confident you'll make the right one now. Is he nervous? Oh, he'll be fine. I had to memorise this speech in grammarschool. You wish you could tell them all that this alliance will givebirth to the Federation. So, I guess we're through here."
