0,TOS,episode 0,HASKINS,"Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute. This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we crashed. You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her whole life with a collection of aging scientists. There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt if Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll accept your judgment."
1,TOS,episode 0,TALOSIAN,"It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited. Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts, Magistrate. We find excellent memory capacity. A curious species. They have fantasies they hide even from themselves. Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much time. Are you prepared to assimilate it? Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to eventual death. Is this not sufficient?"
2,TOS,episode 0,GEOLOGIST,"Geological lab report complete, Captain. Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy with inert elements but well within safety limits. Zero point nine of Earth."
3,TOS,episode 0,VINA,"You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime specimen. I think it's time to show the Captain our secret. You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon. Don't you see it? Here and here. You will. You're a perfect choice. Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come. Hurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food. Please, we must hide ourselves. Come on. The killer! Quick. If you attack while it's not looking. You have to kill him as you did here before. It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what matters. You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you. Please, don't you know what he'll do to us? Because that's the way you imagined me. Careful. It's over. To please you. As real as you wish. Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten. I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish. Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly? You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any woman you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole universe. Let me please you. You're a fool. Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I could answer. If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let me live it with you? They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do. And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll find out about that. War, thousands of centuries ago. But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record. You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy. Please. You said that if I answered questions I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We're like Adam and Eve. If we. Don't. Please don't punish me! You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my saddle. Hey, your coffee. Is it good to be home? Have you forgotten my headaches, darling? I get them when you talk strangely like this. My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? I hope you're hungry. These little white sandwiches are your mother's recipe for chicken tuna. This is a lovely place to rest. Is that supposed to be news to your wife? You're home. You can even stay if you want. Wouldn't it be nice showing your children where you once played? Foolish. They say in the olden days all this was a desert. Blowing sand and cactus. No. PIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now, you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't repair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us, to build a colony of slaves? Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us? Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions. But you can't keep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I know you must hate me for that. But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way. I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for you. You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you, either. A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a ship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and proper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that. No! Let me finish! It's not fair. You don't need them. How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How can that help? He doesn't need you. He's already picked me. Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring. You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with a computer. It's not fair. I did what you asked. Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil. He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship. What is that? If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either. I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again. He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the ship. I can't. I can't go with you. You see why I can't go with you. They found me in the wreckage, dying. A lump of flesh. They rebuilt me. Everything works. But they had never seen a human. They had no guide for putting me back together."
4,TOS,episode 0,BOYCE,"I understand we picked up a distress signal. Oh, I concur with yours, definitely. Who wants a warm martini? Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven? Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it? Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now you're tired and you To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave? And do what? Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day. You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves? Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away. Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers. The living and the dying. If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical report. Their health is excellent. Almost too good. It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery, everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp, the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds. They can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore. Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room. Their power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we do, anything we see. Hold on a minute. You look a hundred percent better. Eve as in Adam?"
5,TOS,episode 0,MAN,They're men. They're humans.
6,TOS,episode 0,SURVIVOR,Is Earth all right?
7,TOS,episode 0,COLT,"Yes, sir. But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred. It's oh five hundred now, sir. We were the only ones transported. Leave him alone. Picked her? For what? I don't understand. Offspring, as in children? Captain. What's happened to Vina? Yes, sir. Sir, I was wondering. Just curious. Who would have been Eve? Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir."
8,TOS,episode 0,PITCAIRN,"Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there completely unobserved. All systems are out, bridge. We've got nothing. Sir, it just came on. We can't shut the power off. Mister Spock, the system is coming on again."
9,TOS,episode 0,OLD,They're men. They're humans.
10,TOS,episode 0,MAGISTRATE,"This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a simple illusion we placed in their minds. You will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions. You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel, and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess, the creature will throw himself against the transparency. Despite its frustration, the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the experiment. I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the specimen something more interesting to protect. The vial contains a nourishing protein complex. If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear as any food you wish to visualise. To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment. From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now consume the nourishment. If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are things even more unpleasant. Now to the female. As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet, but with only a single survivor. We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species interesting. It became necessary to attract a mate. This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species. We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life. With the female now properly conditioned. First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy. Excellent. Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a selection. Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour. The female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce highly intelligent children. Although she seems to lack emotion, this is largely a pretence. She has often has fantasies involving you. The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but now is realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth and strength, plus unusually strong female drives. Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as quickly rewarded. You will find it an effective combination. Your ship. Release me or we'll destroy it. {Bridge] As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing. You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With the female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives. That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's surface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life. Since our lifespan is many times yours, we have time to evolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans, technicians Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves? We had not believed this possible. The customs and history of your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant and benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and dangerous a species for our needs. No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our last hope. Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself too. This is the female's true appearance. It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an honest one. And more. She has an illusion and you have reality. May you find your way as pleasant."
11,TOS,episode 0,ORION,Glistening green. Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain might have. Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
12,TOS,episode 0,PIKE,"Steady as we go. They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way. If they survived the crash. Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the helm. Maintain present course. That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to log the ship's doctor's opinion, too. Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also. What the devil are you putting in there, ice? What makes you think I need one? Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven injured. Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors. You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil. To the point of considering resigning. Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles of parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we used to take some food and ride out all day. I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony. The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole galaxy of things to choose from. Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender. Address intercraft. This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our time warp, factor seven. Engage. Yeoman. I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge Oh, I see. Thank you. She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used to having a woman on the bridge. No offence, Lieutenant. You're different, of course. Spectography? Gravity? Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it? Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us. There's no indication of problems down there, but let's not take chances. Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise. The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon. Enterprise. We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly. That's affirmative on the Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out. I don't understand. Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me? You're not speaking, yet I can hear you. All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an unfriendly act If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it. This is Rigel Seven. I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be there. They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere I've been. It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago. Except for you. Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the survivors called Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you again? Why didn't they create a different girl? But it's only a dream. You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an animal performing for its supper. Why would an illusion be frightened? Who are you? You act as if this were really you. Why are you here? Are you real? No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before, never even imagined you. What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear? So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how I react, is that it? Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too? Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way? Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this conversation, is there. How far can they control my mind? Perhaps. But they try to trick me with their illusions. Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go underground? That's why it's so barren up there? VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again. So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and they concentrated on developing their mental power. Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me. Which means they had to have more than one of each animal. They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to get the Earth woman? But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said you weren't real, remember? Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals? And if I prefer Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you? That's very interesting. You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then? No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck. Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through? All right, all right, let's talk about the girl. You seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel protective. It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and like her. Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human community. You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not co-operating! Why don't you punish me? Tango! You old devil, you. I'm sorry I don't have any sugar. Well, they think of everything, don't they? They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want, if I co-operate, is that it? Look, I'm sorry they punish you, but we can't let them It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the ship's doctor how much I wanted something else not very different from what we have here. An escape from reality. Life with no frustrations. No responsibilities. Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's answer. You either live life, bruises, skinned knees and all, or you turn your back on it and start dying. The doctor's going to be happy about one part, at least. He said I needed a rest. I used to ride through here when I was a kid. It's not as pretty as some of the parkland around the big cities, but. That's Mojave. That's where I was born. These headaches, they'll be hereditary you know. Would you wish them on a child or a whole group of children? Is it? Look, first they made me protect you and then feel sympathy for you. Now we have these familiar surroundings and a comfortable husband-wife relationship. They don't need all this for just passion. What they're after is respect and mutual dependence. But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage! Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our keeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate in your mind, does that block off our mind from them? Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like. If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. I was from the very first moment I saw you in the survivor's camp. Vina? They don't work. Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black out everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate. I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood red like ours? I'm going to find out. All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these thoughts? Images of hate, killing? You'll find my thoughts more interesting. Thoughts so primitive you can't understand. Emotions so ugly No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read through hate. Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck. I've had some samples of how good they are. You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. All right, now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and I'll break your neck. I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason at all. On the other hand, I've got a reason. I'm willing to bet you've created an illusion this laser is empty. I think it just blasted a hole in that window and you're keep us from seeing it. You want me to test my theory out on your head? Make contact, Number One. I want to contact our ship. And start by burying you? Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives of these two Earth women. Do you understand what I'm saying? You give me proof that our ship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina. The weapon is building up an overload. A force chamber explosion. You still have time to get underground. Well, go on! Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her. Wait. And that's it? No apologies? You captured one of us, threatened all of us. But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual co-operation? Let's get back to the ship. You'll give her back her illusion of beauty? No. No, and I agreed with her reasons. Oh, I feel fine, just fine. You recommended a rest, a change of pace, didn't you? I've even been home. Does that make you happy? Yeoman. I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge I Oh. Oh yes. The reports. Thank you. As in all ship's doctors are dirty old men. What are we running here, a cadet ship, Number One? Are we ready or not? Engage. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

13,TOS,episode 0,OFFICER,"Nice place you have here, Mister Pike. Funny how they are on this planet. They actually like being taken advantage of. Suppose you had all of space to choose from, and this was only one small sample."
14,TOS,episode 0,SPOCK,"Check the circuit. It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way. Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia. It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago. Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere. We aren't going to go, to be certain? Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos. Preliminary lab survey ready, sir. Yes, sir. Spock here. There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read? The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life. Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants. They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together. Or it could be something more. Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease power. We've located a magnetic field that seems to come from their underground generator. If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock. The women! Address intercraft. This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew. We're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor. Engine room! Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out. Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen. Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the information stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us. Mister Spock here."
15,TOS,episode 0,GARISON,"It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style distress signal. A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No other message. Eleven survivors from crash. Gravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but unless. The message faded at that point, sir. Sir. Could that be an illusion too? Open, sir. Open. The captain?"
16,TOS,episode 0,TYLER,"All operating, sir. It could be these meteorites. It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain. I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group. It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here. System open. Course computed and on the screen. On course, sir. We've settled into orbit, sir. Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a spaceship hull. Yes, sir. And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time barrier's been broken. Our new ships can Captain! Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up against hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it. Enough to blast half a continent. It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably needs it fast. Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead. There's nothing. Every system aboard is fading out. The computers! I can't shut it off. It's running through our library. Tapes, micro-records, everything. It doesn't make sense. All power has come on, Mister Spock. The helm is answering to control. Eve, sir? Yes, sir."
17,TOS,episode 0,ONE,"No, it's something else. There's still something out there. Evasive manoeuvres, sir? We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out. Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years. Yes, sir. What's that? I didn't say there's anything wrong with me. BOYCE All decks have acknowledged, sir. She's replacing your former yeoman, sir. Of course, sir. Landing party, come in. Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send out scouting and scientific parties now? I didn't get that last message, Captain. Landing party, come in. So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock. Any estimate what they might want one of us for? Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power. We'll try blasting through that metal. Take cover. Increase to full power! Can you give us any more? Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second. Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down inside the Talosian community. Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out. Captain! Captain. But we were a party of six. They were fully charged when we left. It's dead. I can't make a signal. What is it? Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it? Well, shall we do a little time computation? There was a Vina listed on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen years to your age then. Captain. They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and never knew it. Captain. It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves. Captain, we have transporter control now. Isn't she coming with us? Yeoman! You've delivered your report. All decks show ready, sir."

Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to resent the word frequency, I have no answer. Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura. Bridge acknowledging. Explain. Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance. Bridge to Dispensary. Borgia plant listed in library record tapes as carbon group three vegetation similar to Earth nightshade family. Alkaloid poison. Chemical structure common to class M planets. About the strange mottling on his facial skin surface. There is no reference to this symptom. No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly property is alkaloid poison. Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago. Visited by various vessels, made fairly heavy shipments out, of artefacts and reports. However, there has been a marked drop in shipments during the last year. Fascinating. Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it. He would die almost instantly. Standing by. Complete analysis. Spock here. It is the Borgia variety, Captain. Could not have caused Darnell's death. Spock here. Acknowledged. Something odd, Captain. You said two people. We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's circling as if searching for something. Yes, sir. The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile circle. Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to your left. Green. Or something did. Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive. Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult. Why risk your life for his? Acknowledged. Crater! The Earth buffalo. What about it? And now they're gone. Is that what you mean? Always in the past tense. Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and engineering levels, Captain. However, no one or nothing has approached them as yet. Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is reckless. A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room. All the halls sealed off. All weapons accounted for and locked away. Security four in effect on every level. Still no lead on intruder. Recommend we use truth serum, Captain. I'll accompany you, Doctor. It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me. Crater grabbed my phaser. I wondered about McCoy. Doubt had crossed my mind. Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours did. My blood cells are quite different. It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly! It's killing the captain! Shoot, quick! This is not Nancy. If she were Nancy, could she take this? Is that Nancy, Doctor?

I'm an illogical woman who's beginning to feel too much a part of that communications console. Why don't you tell me I'm an attractive young lady, or ask me if I've ever been in love? Tell me how your planet Vulcan looks on a lazy evening when the moon is full. I'm not surprised, Mister Spock. I don't believe it. You explain. That means that somebody is dead and you just sit there. It could be Captain Kirk. He's the closest thing you have to a friend. Message, Captain. Starship base on Caran 4 requesting explanation of our delay here, sir. Space Commander Dominguez says we have supplies he urgently needs. Tell Jose he'll get his chili peppers when we get there. Tell him they're prime Mexican reds. I handpicked them myself, but he won't die if he goes a few more days without them. Got it? Got it, Captain. In a way, ma'am. You were just thinking of someone like me. I'm guessing of course, but you do look a little lonely. I see. So naturally, when I'm lonely I think of you. Una kafeeri Hur. You're Swahili? Lieutenant Uhura. On my way, sir. Yes, Captain. Medical department alert. Doctors and medics acknowledge. Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. Captain's log, additional. Armed and able-bodied crewmen are not attacked and slaughtered this easily. Apparently, the killer can immobilize them as it approaches perhaps with some hypnotic or paralysing power. The answer lies with Professor Crater. Reporting GQ three secure, Captain. Do you require assistance there? He's not in supply and maintenance. Check. He must have been it. You know, I would have remembered a crewman like him. Negative, Captain. I've checked every face on this vessel. It was not a crewman I saw."

41,TOS,episode 1,MCCOY,"Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them? There doesn't seem to be anybody around, does there. Yeah, a little bit, I guess. You see, we walked out of each other's lives ten years ago. She married Crater, and for all I know she may have forgotten me completely. Of all the bonehead ideas, Jim, how'd I let myself in for things like this? Nancy. It's good to see you. You haven't aged a day. Oh, this is Captain Jim Kirk of the Enterprise. And Crewman Darnell. A little less mouth, Darnell. Plum. I'll, er, I'll wait for the professor and I'll catch you both at once. I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that fact. What you want is unimportant right now. What you will get is required by the book. Sit down and breathe deeply, please. You did. That's me. Didn't she mention I was here? Well, it certainly hasn't aged her. She looks exactly as I knew her twelve years ago. Amazing, Jim. Like a girl of twenty five. I'm not joking, Jim. She hasn't aged a day. She doesn't have a grey hair on her head. Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty. Open your mouth. The machine is capable of almost anything but I'll still put my trust in a healthy set of tonsils. Now, open your mouth. Dead, Jim. Strange. A red mottling all over his face. Take it easy, Nancy. Just tell us what you know. No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's something entirely different. Jim, I suppose we could complete these examinations later. She called it a Borgia plant. Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned. She's mistaken. I know alkaloid poison, what to look for. There's not a trace of it in his body. Jim, don't tell me my business. He could not have swallowed any. My instruments would have picked up any trace of it whatsoever. I'll tell you something else. This man shouldn't be dead. I can't find anything wrong with him. According to all the tests he should just get up and walk away from here. I don't know. I'll have the tests double-checked. My eyes may be tricking me. I swear, Jim, when I first saw her she looked just as I'd known her ten years ago. Granted, for a moment I may have been looking at her through a romantic haze. Yes, sir. Captain's log, Stardate 1513.4. In orbit around planet M-113. One crewman, member of the landing party, dead by violence. Cause unknown, but we are certain the cause of death was not poison. Dispensary to Captain. We found something. I'd rather not put it on the speaker. So improbable we almost didn't check it. This man has no salt in his body at all. I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his. Except the red rings on his face. I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part. Oh, forget it. I probably was mooning over her. I should have been thinking about my job. Salt tablets. Our crewman died of salt depletion. Sudden, total loss of it. Medically impossible by any standards. Salt. Jim, he's run off. Professor Crater! Jim! Jim, it's Sturgeon. He's dead. Crewman Green, report! Green! Green, where are you? Could it be Crater? He came this way. Same red rings on his face. Have you seen Nancy, Mrs. Crater? I'm worried about her, Jim. She's not at the quarters, she's not at the diggings. She could be in trouble. Nancy! Nancy, it's Leonard! You can't leave her! Jim! All right, Jim. McCoy to Bridge. Captain there? Nope. Nancy. Well, come in. come in. I've been worried sick about you. I wonder why Jim didn't tell me he found you. Well. Nancy, er You're as bad as Jim Kirk. He's been telling me to take these. I was so worried. Your husband acting strange, crewmen dying. The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu? Or whatever it is that's killing the crewmen. Perhaps I can help. Fill me in. Yes? Oh. Well, we could offer it salt without tricks. There's no reason for it to attack us. No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability to take other forms. And like us, it's an intelligent animal. There's no need to hunt it down. Well, I resist using it, but in this case the professor will give us the truth. Oh, yes. Of course. Easy, easy. Nobodies going to What's going on here, Jim? Are you insane? It? No! You're frightening her, Jim. Stop it, Jim! Are you out of your mind? No! No! I won't shoot Nancy. Stop it! Stop it, Spock! Stop it! No. No! Lord, forgive me."

Well, I, I I was just. I couldn't find Bob, and I was coming back. I crossed to your crewman. I wanted him to know I wasn't offended by the things he'd said back there. You remember. Then I, I noticed he had a Borgia plant in his hand. Before I could say anything, he, he'd taken a bite from it. He fell, his face all twisted, and. Leonard, you're looking at me like you don't believe me. Salt. You did ask them about more salt tablets? I'm so happy to see you, Leonard. The others, they, I, I don't relate to them as much as you. You have such strong memories of me. You do care, don't you, Leonard? It makes me feel so, so safe. My husband? I like your feelings better. Much stronger. But you're tired, You need to rest. I think you should. I'll get you some water. You're so tired, darling. Just rest now. It's nothing, dear. It's nothing. You just sleep. Nancy will take care of everything. Leonard. Leonard, wake up.

47,TOS,episode 1,KIRK,"Shall we pick some flowers, Doctor? When a man visits an old girlfriend she usually expects something like that. They'll be along. You rushed us down ten minutes early. Professor Crater? Professor? Mrs. Crater? Nervous, Dr. McCoy? Mrs. Crater. I've heard a great deal about you. Something wrong, Darnell? Why don't you step outside, Darnell. Maybe I'll step outside, too. Plum? Professor Crater, I'm Captain Kirk. This is Quote. All research personnel on alien planets are required to have their health certified by a starship surgeon at one year intervals. Like it or not, Professor, as commander of the starship, I'm required He's all yours, Plum. Doctor McCoy. She went out to get you. Yes. Why? Quite all right. She's got some grey, Bones. Excuse me, Professor, she's a handsome woman, yes, but hardly twenty five. McCoy. What happened? I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what happened. We're well aware of our next duties, Professor. We'll complete your examinations tomorrow. Transporter room. Lock onto us. Three beaming up. Something new to me. Go ahead, Mister Spock. Stand by, Mister Spock. She said she saw him eat the plant. There were bits of the plant in his mouth. Then what kills a healthy man How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest me. I've lost a man. I want to know what killed him. Well? And Professor Crater and wife? Kirk here. What is it? What? Can you explain that, Doctor? How? There isn't a mark on his body. You called that skin mottling. I'm not counting them, Bones. Are you in the mood for an apology? Perhaps you were. Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to mention one item they needed. Mister Spock, outfit a landing party. We're beaming down with some questions. I have, Professor. Believe me, I have. Where is Mrs. Crater? I want to talk to her, too. Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again. Green, find her. Mister Spock. Sturgeon, transport a sample of the plant to Mister Spock. We'll check if it's actually the Borgia plant or something we don't understand. You got that, Mister Spock? Your complaint is noted, sir. Look, something we don't understand killed one of my men. It could prove to be a danger to you and Mrs. Crater, too. Bones, tell the professor what the autopsy revealed. And by coincidence, both you and Mrs. Crater requested salt tablets. We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet like this, Professor, but it's a mystery, and I don't like mysteries. They give me a bellyache and I've got a beauty right now. One of the missions of the Enterprise is to protect human life in places like this. I'm going to have to ask you and Mrs. Crater to stay aboard my ship until we find out what killed that crewman. But I can, Professor. How? You've been here five years. Will a couple of days make a difference? Mister Spock. Arrange quarters for Professor and Mrs. Crater. Did you get the plant analysis? Professor Crater! Professor Crater! Professor Crater! Professor! Professor! We'd better locate Crewman Green. Green! Green! Crewman Green, report! Green! I don't know. Green! Did you see this? Crater! We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor. We can't search this whole planet on foot. You could learn something from Mister Spock, Doctor. Stop thinking with your glands. We've equipment aboard the Enterprise that could pinpoint a match lit anywhere on this planet, or the heat of a body. Transporter room, Kirk speaking. Three to beam up. Kirk to Bridge. Break out the surface search equipment. I want co-ordinates on two people. There's a body down there. Sturgeon. You could use some sleep, Bones. Bridge. Professor and Nancy Crater. Expand search radius. Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge. Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge. Lieutenant Uhura, report to the Bridge. Kirk here. Nothing to report, Doctor. We haven't located Mrs. Crater. What's the matter, can't you sleep? Try taking one of those red pills you gave me last week. You'll sleep. All right. We'll triangulate on him. We'll let Professor Crater explain what happened to his wife. Remember my instructions, Lieutenant. Keep a tight fix on us. If we let out a yell I want an armed party down there before the echo dies. Professor Crater. We? Where's your wife, Professor? We're concerned about her. Where's your wife, Professor? We're worried about her safety. Aren't you? Professor, you're a reasonable man, let me Kirk here. Stand by, Mister Sulu. Spock has something. He beamed up to the ship with us. Enterprise from Kirk. You have an intruder aboard. Could be masquerading as Crewman Green. General quarters, security condition three. Negative, Lieutenant, but keep locked in on us. Kirk out. Let's get him. Set your phaser on one quarter. I'll leave mine on stun. He's not trying to kill us, he's trying to frighten us, and he's doing a pretty good job. Set. Your wife, Professor. Where is she? Your wife, Professor. Where is she? The last of her kind? Just stunned. You'll be able to think in a minute. Where's your wife? Where is she now? When? Kirk to Enterprise. It's definite, Mister Sulu. The intruder can assume any shape. Crewmen, you, myself, anyone. Do you understand? Go to GQ four. Kirk to transporter room. Three to beam up. There's one, Professor. Your creature is killing my people. Captain's log, continuing. The Enterprise has been invaded by a creature capable of assuming any form, and with the capacity to paralyse and draw the life from any one of us. Yeoman Rand, how long was this Green with you? Mister Spock? Dr. McCoy? Medical department report, Doctor. Thank you, Lieutenant. Continue the search. Crater, we don't know who or what we're looking for. We need your help, and now. Can you recognise this thing When you see it? Professor, I'll forego charges up to this point but this creature's aboard my ship and I'll have it, or I'll have your skin, or both. Now where is it? And it becomes Nancy for you. You bleed too much, Crater. You're too pure and noble. Are you saving the last of its kind or has this become Crater's private heaven, here on this planet? This thing becomes wife, lover, best friend, wise man, fool, idol, slave. It isn't a bad life to have everyone in the universe at your beck and call, and you win all the arguments. Have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes? Are you going to help us find it? Doctor? Take him. Dead. But it had you, too. Move aside, Bones. She's not Nancy, Bones. It killed four crewmen. Now Crater. The creature. It kills. It needs salt to live. Bones, move aside. My guess is she needs more. You want it, Nancy? Come and get it. Not fright. Hunger. Look at her. Come on. You want this, Nancy? Come on Nancy. Come and get it. Come and get it. Here it is. McCoy, get out of the way! Get out of the way. I'm sorry, Bones.  I was thinking about the buffalo, Mister Spock. Warp one, Mister Sulu."
48,TOS,episode 1,CRATER,"The heroic Captain and the intrepid doctor cross interstellar space to preserve our health. Your sense of duty is overwhelming. Now will you please go back where you came from and tell whoever issues your orders to leave me and my wife alone. We need salt against the heat. Aside from that, we're doing very well, thank you. Doubtless the good surgeon will enjoy prodding and poking us with his arcane machinery. Go away, we don't want you. To show your gold braid to everyone. You love it, don't you. Did I hear you call him Doctor McCoy? McCoy. I've heard Nancy speak of a Doctor McCoy. You've seen Nancy? You've seen her too? You were with the good Doctor? Nothing. It's just that it gives me pleasure to know that she's gotten to see an old friend and has a chance for some company. It's different for me, I enjoy solitude. But for a woman. You understand, of course. Sorry. I'm sorry, Captain, sit down. I seem to have forgotten my manners. You've seen my wife with the eyes of your past attachment, Doctor. I'm sure when Nancy lets, when you see her again she'll be a believable age. Genuine affection. I'm glad you still feel it for her. Leonard, isn't it? She's a fine woman. Why, I thought the machine What do you suppose happened, Captain? You beam down a crewman who doesn't know better than to eat an untested plant. We don't need an examination, you can see that. Perhaps you'd better take your man and I'll take care of the provisioning, Nancy. One might think that you had more important duties than harassing people, Captain. Captain, you can't just beam down here and bully us, and interfere with our work. Possibly at the other diggings. We don't keep military logs Captain, considering the inescapable fact that you are a trespasser on my planet We've been here for almost five years. If there were anything hostile here we would know about it, wouldn't we? And your esteemed physician cannot explain our need for salt tablets? Nancy and I started with twenty five pounds. This is what we have left. Now what is so mysterious about that? But you can't do that. Nancy! You! Salt! I've got salt! Smell it! Smell it, Nancy! Go away! We don't want you here. I'm armed. Go away. She's no concern of yours. We don't want you here! We're happy alone! I'll kill to stay alone. You hear that, Kirk? Or you'll have to kill me. II don't care either way. She was the last of her kind. The last of its kind. Earth history, remember? Like the passenger pigeon or buffalo. Ooh! I feel strange. Once there were millions of them prairies black with them. One herd covered three whole states, and when they moved they were like thunder. Like the creatures here. Once there were millions of them. Now there's one left. Nancy understood. Dead. Buried up on the hill. It killed her. Oh, a year, or was it two? The creature was trying to survive. It has that right, doesn't it? They needed salt to stay alive. There was no more salt. It's the last one. The buffalo. There is no difference. The creature is not dangerous when fed. The way the chameleon uses its protective colouring, an ability retained no doubt from its primitive state, the way we have retained our incisor teeth. They were once fangs. Certain of our muscles were designed for chase. It uses its ability the way we would use our muscles and teeth if necessary, to stay alive. I demanded, I even begged that you get off my planet. I loved Nancy very much. Few women like my Nancy. She lives in my dreams. She walks and sings in them. Not because of tricks. It doesn't trick me. It needs love as much as it needs salt. When it killed Nancy, I almost destroyed it but, it isn't just a beast. It is intelligent and the last of its kind. You don't understand. Yes. Sorry, I can't."

That was a mistake, Charlie. Checkmate. If you'll excuse me.  Thasians have been referred to in our records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances invisible. It has generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie does seems to possess this same power. Agreed. The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life. And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone, anywhere on this ship. Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him.

I'll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with that, or find him one. On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving. If the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey. Charlie. Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works. Me. I see. Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady, er, Charlie, that you er. There's no right way to hit a woman. I mean, man to man is one thing, but, er, man and woman, er, it's, er, it's, er. Well it's, er, another thing. Do you understand? Excuse me. Kirk here. I'm on my way to the Bridge now. I don't think so, Charlie. Okay. Kirk here, Captain Ramart. Re-establish contact. Keep trying. Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe scanners, Mister Spock. You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie? What about the Antares? Kirk here. Chief, have you been  Captain's Log, star date 1535.8. headquarters notified of the mysterious loss of science probe vessel Antares. A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost. No reason. Obviously, Captain Ramart was not aware of any trouble. I can't figure it. I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time? I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come in, Charlie. Checkmate. I prefer to call it inspired. You play chess, Charlie? I place you in the hands of our chess master.  What? Charlie's a seventeen year old boy. I talked to him about the swat. Yes, Yeoman, I'll talk to him. I'll look into it. Come in, Charlie. Er, Charlie. Charlie, do you know anything about this chess piece? Did you notice anything peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon? Er, no. No, no. Sit down. Charlie, being seventeen is more than how many years you've lived. It's a whole other thing. Doctor McCoy could probably explain the biological conditions. Well, let's, let's use a specific. Yeoman Rand is a woman. No, there's more to it than that. Now wait, wait. You'll live, believe me. There's nothing wrong with you that hasn't gone wrong with every other human male since the model first came up. You go slow. You be gentle. I mean, it's not a one-way street, you know, how you feel and that's all. It's how the girl feels, too. Don't press, Charlie. If the girl feels anything for you at all, you'll know it. Do you understand? She's not the girl, Charlie. The years are wrong, for one thing, and there are other things. No, Charlie. No. Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have and there are a million things you can't have. It's no fun facing that, but that's the way things are. Hang on tight and survive. Everybody does. Everybody, Charlie. Me, too. Kirk here. Ask Mister Spock to see to it. Charlie, come on with me. You've got to slap the floor to absorb the energy when you fall. Go ahead, try it. Like everything else, it takes practice, Charlie. Try again. Good. That's much better. Here, now I'll show you a shoulder roll. Try that. Well, it makes it hard to teach you All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today. You have to learn to protect yourself in a fall before I do that. It's more than teaching you to defend yourself. Charlie, I want you to learn. Charlie? Hey, Sam, let me borrow you for a couple easy throws, all right? Watch this, Charlie. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw him. Here we go, Sam. Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go.  That wasn't so bad, was it? Cool off. Charlie. What happened to him, Charlie? That's no answer. Kirk here. Two men from security, on the double. I'm confining you to quarters. I want you to stay there. They won't hurt you, Charlie. They'll take you to your quarters, Charlie. Go with them. Go to your quarters. Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there. That's your choice, Charlie. They won't hurt you. Kirk here. No, I heard you. Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in the Briefing room. What are chances that Charlie's not an Earthling, that he's a Thasian? Well, whatever he is, we have some idea of the power he has. I know what I saw him do in the gymnasium. Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand. He needs, he wants. Nothing happens fast enough. He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy. It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us to Earth Colony Five. Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment. I've talked with him, listened. He's a boy in a man's body, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way. Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie? Answer me. What about us, Charlie? Lieutenant, raise Colony Five. I want to speak directly to the governor. Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five. Buy me some time. Spock, get the doctor up here on the double. How bad is it? Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments? Mister Spock. Release the transmitter. See to her, Doctor. That's enough, Charlie. Leave my crew alone. I know. Spock. Mister Spock? Let him go, too, Charlie. Because I'm telling you to. Because you need me to run the ship, and I need him. And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed? Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one that's coming in. I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on. Mister Spock? Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away with anybody since he took over? Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big ship. He's taken full control. If we could tax his power, turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you could tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five. If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no choice, gentlemen, none at all. Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now. Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but you're going to have to. You're going to have to take me on. You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back, whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! It's all right, Yeoman. The boy belongs with his own kind. With training, we can teach him to live in our society. If he can be taught not to use his power Is there nothing you can do? It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Why don't you join me in recreation room six, deck three. Charlie! Charlie, you, you, you just don't go around slapping girls on the. It's okay, but er, just don't do it again. Look, why don't you tell Captain Kirk or Doctor McCoy what you did. They'll explain it to you. Okay? Okay. One more time! Well, how did you do that? I don't believe this!  Oh, Charlie.

Charlie, Tina's That was, that was rude and completely uncalled-for. That's no excuse. You'd better learn that right now. You have to live with people, Charlie. You're not alone anymore. I wasn't sure I should, er, talk to you about this. Exactly, and he's It's not that. Captain, I've seen the look before, and if something isn't done, sooner or later I'm going to have to hurt him. Tell him to leave me alone, and that wouldn't be good for him right now. You see, I'm his first crush, his first love, and his first Thank you, sir. You don't walk into a room without knocking.

Over four hundred in the crew of a starship, aren't there, Captain? You see. We'd like to keep Charlie with us, but with his closest living relatives on Colony Five and your vessel going that way, why No, we've a tight schedule to make, Captain. Just twenty of us, we're making out fine. Nothing. We're fine, thank you. Pleasant journey, Captain. We're at full output, Enterprise. I must speak to Captain Kirk.

Four? That, that Captain. Kirk? Why does he call me Mister Evans? He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart. Do you like me? Some, the other ship, they didn't like me. I tried. I'm trying to make people like me. I want them to like me. I brought you a present. Do you like that kind? It's a present. Can't you stay and talk a little while? You got a deal, friend. I thought. Don't be angry. I didn't, I wanted. Don't be angry. I will. Want to see something? Turn them over. Oh, I can do a lot of card tricks. One of the men on the Antares showed me.  Captain? I'm supposed to ask you something. Why shouldn't I? I don't know how to explain it. Well, in the corridor I saw. When Janice, when Yeoman Rand was. I did that to her. She didn't like it. She said you'd explain it to me. I don't know. Can I come with you? I won't get in the way. It wasn't very well constructed. I don't know. Oh, I, I watched them play on the Antares. Can I try? I know what it is. Let's play. No, it wasn't. No, it isn't. Can I talk to you, alone. But I don't need her. I want to talk to you. But she's not as. She doesn't. She's not the same. Not like you. She's, she's just a girl. You're, you smell like a girl. All the other girls on the ship they, they look just like Tina. You're the only one who looks like you. You can understand, can't you? You know about being with somebody? Wanting to be? If I had the whole universe I'd give it to you. When I see you, I feel like I'm hungry all over. Hungry. Do you know how that feels? No, sir. Is that all? Oh, I won't hit her like that anymore. Everything I do or say is wrong. I'm in the way, I don't know the rules, and when I learn something and try to do it, suddenly I'm wrong! I don't know what I am or what I'm supposed to be, or even who. I don't know why I hurt so much inside all the time. What if you care for someone? What do you do? You don't think Janice. You. She could love me! She can. She is. But if I did what you said! If I was gentle! Then what am I going to do? You don't. I'm trying, but I don't know how. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. You were going to teach me how to fight. That looks hard. Oh!  Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh at me!  He shouldn't have done that. It's not nice to laugh at people. He's gone. He's gone! I didn't mean to do that. He made me do it! He laughed at me. What are you going to do to me? I won't let them hurt me. I'll make them go away, too. No! He was going to hurt me. I won't let you. I won't let them hurt me. You wanted to ask me something, he said. Why? Yes. There was a warped baffle-plate on the shield of their energy pile. I made it go away. It would've blown up anyway. Well they weren't nice to me! They wanted to get rid of me. They don't now. I don't know.  You're trying to change course, Captain. You can't do that. I want to get to Colony Five as soon as we can. You don't need all that subspace chatter. Very nice, Mister Ears. Oh, I can make him do anything, whirl around, laugh, anything. Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny. I have something for you. Pink is your favourite, isn't it? Don't ever lock your door on me again, Janice. I love you. You. I only want to be nice to you. I can give you anything. Just, just tell me. But I only want to be nice to you. I love you. Then show me. Why did she do that? I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all. What you did wasn't nice either, but I still need you, Captain. The Enterprise isn't quite like the Antares. Running the Antares was easy. You have to be nice. All right? Why? If you try to hurt me again, I'll make a lot of people go away. I won't tell you. Growing up isn't so much. I'm not a man, and I can do anything! You can't. He had a mean look. I had to freeze him. I like happy looks. Aren't you coming in? That wasn't nice. You'll be sorry. You wait, you'll see, you'll be sorry you did that. You will. No. No laughing! It's my game, Captain. You have to find out. Like you said, that's how the game's played. You can have it now. I've locked on course for Colony Five again. I can make you all go away anytime I want to. I've got your ship, Captain. I could've sent you away before, but I didn't. Don't make me do it now. Don't push me. Sorry. I'm sorry but. Stop it. I said stop it! Oh. No! Oh, no, please, don't let them take me. I can't live with them anymore. You're my friends. You said you were my friends, remember? When I came aboard! Please, I want to go home. Take me home. I won't do it again. Please, I'll be good. I won't ever do it again. I'm sorry about the Antares. I'm sorry! When I came aboard! Please, I want to go with you. Help me! Oh, please, don't let them take me. I can't even touch them! Janice, they can't feel. Not like you! They don't love! Please, I want to stay."

The fact one of my ancestors married a human female Not large enough even for a lifeboat. Small enough to bring it aboard, sir, if you want to risk it. More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt, pitted. He played most illogically. His next move should have been the rook. The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks. Getting something from the recorder now. Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction. Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counter orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's computer records for anything concerning in human beings. Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it. No, this must be garbled. I get something about destruct. I must have read it wrong. It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy his own ship. Force field of some kind. Sensor beam on. Deflectors full intensity. Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't. Density negative. Radiation negative. Energy negative. Negative! Damage control reports, all stations! Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells. Casualties, nine dead. I think we've found that answer, Doctor. Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically searching for information on his crew. Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects, cause fires to start spontaneously? Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal power. He's reading even faster now than just a few moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know? Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what he is mutating into. Have you noted evidence of unusual powers? And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement. In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him, but actually an annoyance. We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us as we'd have with a ship full of white mice. Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines. It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship. Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still can. It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you still have time. The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that. He's regaining consciousness. Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at least. He could be handled now. He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed back faster. He didn't become as weak. Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time. If he should try to stop us I felt for him, too."

128,TOS,episode 3,SCOTT,"Materialiser ready, sir. Yes, sir. It's begun transmitting, sir. Engineering division ready, as always. About an hour ago, the Bridge controls started going crazy. Levers shifting by themselves, buttons being pushed, instrument readings changing. It fits like a glove, Captain. Oh, did Mister Spock get the phaser rifle we sent down? You're a talented thief, Kelso. Everything you sent up seems to be fitting in place."
129,TOS,episode 3,KIRK,"We should have intercepted by now. The Bridge said they'd call. Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess, Mister Spock? Certain you don't know what irritation is? Terrible having bad blood like that. Bridge to briefing lounge. Object is now within tractor beam range. No visual contact, Mister Kelso? Lock onto it, Mister Kelso. Bring it aboard. Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected when something threatened the ship. Let's hope its tapes are intact. We'll feed it through Mister Spock's computer. Flash the Bridge. Put all decks on the alert. Getting into shape? Screen on. Neutralise warp, Mister Mitchell. Hold this position. Address intercraft. This is the Captain speaking. The object we encountered is a ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S. S. Valiant two hundred years ago. We hope to learn from the recorder what the Valiant was doing here and what destroyed the vessel. We'll move out into our probe as soon as we have those answers. All decks, stand by. The old impulse engines weren't strong enough. Extrasensory perception. Doctor Dehner, how are you on ESP? I'm asking what you know about ESP. Comments? That's probably the best argument to continue the probe. Other vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what they'll be facing. We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell. Ahead, warp factor one. Gravitation on automatic. Emergency stations. All decks on fire alert. Neutralise controls. Kelso, put it on manual. Any radiation? Anything? Helmsmen, take us out of here. Helmsmen! Lateral power! Take damage reports. Gary. Gary, are you all right? And you, are you feeling all right? You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of extrasensory perception. So do the records of the others. Gary Mitchell has the highest esper rating of all. Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind? I've been worried about you ever since that night on Deneb IV. Do you feel any different? How? I wasn't that bad, was I? You what? You planned that? I almost married her! You? Spinoza? Go on. I'm going to ask Doctor Dehner to keep you under observation for a while. Consider it a challenge. Put a twenty four hour watch on the Sickbay. Fullest possible range of examinations and tests. That's enough, Doctor. It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to see I'm provided with that. Go ahead, Mister Spock. Mister Scott, would you repeat what you just told us? Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude? And you didn't think it worth mentioning? Mister Sulu. There'll be no discussion of this with the crew. Thank you. I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings. And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there. We haven't enough power to blast back out. If you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it. That station is fully automated. There's not a soul on the whole planet. Even the ore ships call only once every twenty years. Get out of here. Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got a heart. We're talking about Gary. Set course for Delta Vega. Star date 1313.1. We're now approaching Delta Vega. Course set for a standard orbit. This planet, completely uninhabited, is slightly smaller than Earth. Desolate, but rich in crystal and minerals. Kelso's task, transport down with a repair party, try to regenerate the main engines, save the ship. Our task, transport down a man I've known for fifteen years, and if we're successful, maroon him there. Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary? What would you do in my place? I want him unconscious for a while. Energise. Can you do it, Lee? Take him. Nobody but us chickens, Doctor. The fuel bins, Lee. Could they be detonated from here? Do it. Doctor Piper. I want only one medical officer here at any one time. The other will monitor him on the dispensary screen. And almost died. I remember. You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise. In the transporter room, you said something about us seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us if we got in your way. Yes. In the Sickbay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill a mutant like yourself. Gary. Gary, don't! His eyes went back to normal. I didn't order any Affirmative. Landing party out. Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong? If Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if sitting here, you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button. Captain's log, Star date 1313.3. Note commendations on Lieutenant Kelso and the engineering staff. In orbit above us, the engines of the Enterprise are almost fully regenerated. Balance of the landing party is being transported back up. Mitchell, whatever he's become, keeps changing, growing stronger by the minute. Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso. We'll all transport up together. Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute. I think he knows that. You're leaving with the ship, Doctor. I gave you an order, Doctor. Doctor Dehner? Don't give him a pill until after I'm gone. It's my fault Mitchell got as far as he did. Did you see their direction? When Mister Spock recovers, you'll both transport up immediately to the Enterprise. If you have not received a signal from me within twelve hours, you'll proceed at maximum warp to the nearest Earth base with my recommendation that this entire planet be subjected to a lethal concentration of neutron radiation. No protest on this, Mark. That's an order. You must help me Before it goes too far. And for humanity? You're still human At least partly, you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me. What will Mitchell learn in getting there? Will he know what to do with his power? Will he acquire the wisdom? Did you hear him joke about compassion? Above all else, a god needs compassion. Mitchell! Elizabeth. Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties. As powerful as he gets, he'll have all that inside him. You were a psychiatrist once. You know the ugly, savage things we all keep buried, that none of us dare expose. But he'll dare. Who's to stop him? He doesn't need to care. Be a psychiatrist for one minute longer. What do you see happening to him? What's your prognosis, Doctor? Then watch him. Hang on to being a human for one minute longer. A god, but still driven by human frailty. Do you like what you see? To you? Not to both of you? There'll only be one of you in the end. One jealous god. if all this makes a god, or is it making you something else? Do you like what you see? Absolute power corrupting absolutely. Gary, forgive me. Enterprise from Captain Kirk, come in. Captain's log, Star date 1313.8. Add to official losses, Doctor Elizabeth Dehner. Be it noted she gave her life in performance of her duty. Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, same notation. I want his service record to end that way. He didn't ask for what happened to him. I believe there's some hope for you after all, Mister Spock. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Well, the main engines are gone, unless we can find some way to re-energise them. Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch. I'll, er, I'll get on it right away. I just wanted to stop by and make sure you were okay. See you later. Well, it didn't make any sense that he'd know, but naturally, I checked out the circuit anyway. I don't know how, but he was right. This point is burned out exactly the way he described it. Maybe, if we can bypass the fuel bins without blowing ourselves up. Good, Alden. Transport it up with you, will you? A destruct switch? I guess I could wire one up right there. Direct to the power bins. From here you could blow up this whole valley. Fission chamber three checks out. The station seems to be running fine.

Walking freezer unit. We're coming up on it fast. I'm a little weak for some reason, Jim, but I feel all right now. Captain's log, Star date 1312.9. Ship's condition, heading back on impulse power only. Main engines burned out. The ship's space warp ability gone. Earth bases which were only days away are now years in the distance. Our overriding question now is what destroyed the Valiant? They lived through the barrier, just as we have. What happened to them after that? Hello, Jim. Hey, you look worried. Yeah, she was nova, that one. Not nearly as many after-effects this time, except for the eyes. They kind of stare back at me when I'm shaving. Well, in a way, I feel better than I've ever felt before in my life. Actually seems to have done me some good. Well, I'm getting a chance to read some of that longhair stuff you like. Hey man, I remember you back at the Academy. A stack of books with legs. The first thing I ever heard from an upperclassman was, watch out for Lieutenant Kirk. In his class, you either think or sink. If I hadn't aimed that little blonde lab technician at you Well, you wanted me to think, didn't you? I outlined her whole campaign for her. Better be good to me. I'm getting even better ideas here. Once you get into him, he's rather simple though. Childish, almost. I don't agree with him at all. Hey, I'm trying to tell you I feel fine. When do I go back on duty? With almost a hundred women on board, you can do better than that, friend Captain. That doesn't seem very friendly. Didn't I say you'd better be good to me? I've got nothing against you, Doctor. Well, I, sorry about that. You know, everybody, everybody seems worried that I don't have some kind of fever or something. Maybe if we could just change these dials . Now back to normal, I think. I'm not sure, I, I just thought of making it happen, and it does. It's, hey, er hey watch this, Doc. Yeah. Oh, boy. You, you know, Doc, there have been other things too, like going halfway through the ship's library in hardly a day. Yeah. Oh, what's happening to me? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with grace in upswept curve and tapered tip. The Nightingale Woman, written by Phineas Tarbolde on the Canopius planet back in 1996. It's funny you picked that one, Doctor. That's one of the most passionate love sonnets of the past couple of centuries. How do you feel, Doctor? How do you feel? Er, I was on my coffee break. I thought I'd check up on Yeah, that's okay Lee, come on in. Don't let the light in my eyes bother you, pal. It's all for our, our good-looking lady doctor here. Yeah. Sure. So, er, so, how go the repairs? You'd better check the starboard impulse packs. Those points have about decayed to lead. I'm not joking, Lee! You activate those packs, and you'll blow the whole impulse deck. He's a fool. A fool. He'd seen those points and he hadn't noticed their condition. The image of what he'd seen was still in his mind. I'm thirsty. It's like a man who has been blind all of his life, suddenly being given sight. Sometimes I feel there's nothing I couldn't do, in time. Some people think that makes me a monster, don't they Jim. I can sense mainly worry in you, Jim. Safety of your ship. Probably just what Mister Spock is thinking now. Kill me while you can. I also know we're orbiting Delta Vega, Jim. I can't let you force me down there. I may not want to leave this ship, not yet. I may want another place. I'm not sure yet just what kind of a world I can use. I don't understand it all yet, but if I keep growing, getting stronger, why, the things I could do, like, like maybe a god could do. You fools! Soon I'll squash you like insects. My friend James Kirk. remember those rodent things on Dimorus? The poisoned darts they threw? I took one meant for you. So why be afraid of me now? I was drugged then. Why don't you kill me then? Mister Spock is right and you're a fool if you can't see it. Man cannot survive if a race of true espers is born. In time you'll understand that. Jim. I'll just keep getting stronger. You know that, don't you. You should have killed me while you could, James. Command and compassion is a fool's mixture. Then I shall make one. Behold. You'll soon share this feeling, Elizabeth. To be like God, to have the power to make the world anything you want it to be. A visitor. A very foolish man. You'll enjoy being a god, Elizabeth. Blasphemy? No. Let there be food. Kaferian apples. Whenever we visited that planet, I always favoured these. Can you hear me, James? You cannot see me. I'm not there. You follow the right path, James. You'll come to me soon. Go to him, Elizabeth, talk to him. Now that you're changing I want you to see just how unimportant they are. I'm disappointed in you, Elizabeth. I've been contemplating the death of an old friend. He deserves a decent burial, at least. Morals are for men, not gods. Time to pray, Captain. Pray to me. Pray that you die easily. Your last chance, Kirk. For a moment, James, but your moment is fading."

I heard that's more your specialty, Commander, line included. In tests I've taken, my rated rather high. It is a fact that some people can sense future happenings, read the backs of playing cards and so on, but the esper capacity is always quite limited. Something hit me, like an electrical charge. Autopsy report, sir. Each case showed damage to the body's neural circuit. An area of the brain was burned out. Yes. Mitchell, too, except for his eyes. We're trying to find a reason for that now, and why, out of our whole crew, only certain people were affected. lf you're suggesting there's anything dangerous Espers are simply people with flashes of insight. There's nothing about it that could possibly make a person dangerous. Perhaps you know of another kind? I know you don't particularly like me, Mister Mitchell, but since I am assigned here, can we make the best of it? Nor against the walking freezer unit? Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now let's talk about you. How do you feel? How did you do that? Stop it. Stop it! You were dead for almost twenty two seconds. There were no readings at all. Do you remember everything you read that quickly? On any tape? Try this one. Page three eighty seven. Why? What? I just fell. Nothing happened. No? Are you sure? Are you sure? How do you know? Sorry I'm late. I became so interested in observing Gary, Mister Mitchell. I know those from your planet aren't suppose to have feelings like we do, Mister Spock, but to talk that way about a man you've worked next to for years is worse than I don't think so. I understand you least of all. Gary told me that you've been friends since he joined the service, that you asked for him aboard your first command. He can control certain autonomic reflexes. He reads very fast, retains more than most of us might consider usual. I saw some such indications. No one's been hurt, have they? Don't you understand? A mutated superior man could also be a wonderful thing. The forerunner of a new and better kind of human being. Stop it, Gary! Use? There's not a soul on this planet but us? I'd like to stay now, try to talk to him. You don't mean that, Gary. He's been like that for hours now. I'm staying behind with him. He is not evil. It would take almost a miracle to survive here. What's wrong? I can see him in my mind, too. Yes, it just took a little longer for it to happen to me. What he's doing is right for him and me. No, I Earth is really unimportant. Before long, we'll be where it would have taken mankind millions of years of learning to reach. Please go back while you still can. What do you know about gods? Go back. He's coming. Stop it, Gary. Hurry. You haven't much time. I'm sorry. You can't know what it's like to be almost a god."

Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you read, Enterprise? All station personnel are dead. Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before. Captain's Log You received my signal, Mister Scott. The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain. I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something. Next tape, please. Thank you. He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery. It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no contamination, no unusual elements present. Instruments register only those things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns. We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit. When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity, mass, magnetic field. It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts. All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain. Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected. A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours. Psychiatric file, personality quotients. It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured. His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force. Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface moves away from us. Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change. Rate of compaction seems constant. Acknowledged. Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station? Take over here, Rand. You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu? You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station. Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley. Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge. Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura. Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were Precisely. Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century. Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position. Engine room, we need power! Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay. Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere. Status reports, all sections. Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections. We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is. No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir. Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've stabilised, but still spiraling down. Crewman, report to the lab! What's going on? Crewman, stand aside. Message from the captain. We have fourteen minutes left. At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a safety factor. Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy? Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab! What is it, Nurse? Nurse, you should I'm in control of my emotions. I'm sorry. I am sorry. Christine. I'm in control of my emotions.

Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed. t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings. It's never been done. Jim. Jim, there is an intermix formula. It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter. Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge. Fuel temperature. Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees. We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready. Are you all right, Jim? Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded. Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling faster than is possible for normal space. We're back to normal time, Captain. Yes, sir. We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again. This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era."

Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively. Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing. This shouldn't be happening. This man should be getting stronger. You sure the respirator's functioning properly? Why is this man dying? Hypo. The wounds were not that severe. This is McCoy. Captain Kirk to Sickbay. Intestinal damage wasn't that severe. I got to him in plenty of time. That man should still be alive. The only reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live. He gave up. Well, that may be. Maybe. I've lost patients before, but not like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up. You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're gonna ask me if it's connected. Jim, he was decontaminated. He's been medically checked. We've run every test we know for everything we know. Well, we're doing everything that's possible. Sickbay to Bridge. I'm getting you, Jim. Look, can you keep this beast level? I've got Sulu tranquillized and we're running tests on him. So far there's nothing unusual in his bloodstream. Body functions seem normal. Negative, until I can get a little farther on these tests. Biopsy lab. Biopsy, where's my report? Biopsy, come in! Harrison, where's my report? I'm going to the lab. Yes? Oh, good. I'll need him conscious now. Continue to examine him on circuits K one and three. McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum. It's water. Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex chain of molecules. That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through perspiration. Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses the centres of judgment, self-control. Now get someone to the lab. Tell them the serum works, and start preparing more. Release him. We found a cure. We're over that part of it."

We've got to leave. Take it easy, Joe. Now calm down. You're all steamed up, Joe. What are you doing, Joe? Joey, don't be a fool. Magnetic field continuing to shift, sir. Planet continuing to shrink in mass. Helm answering nicely, Captain. Relative gravity increase, sir. Like the planet reached out and yanked at us. Don't know if it's this planet or what happened with Joe. I'm sweating like a bridegroom. Hey, why don't you come down to the gym with me, Kevin m'lad? Why not? Light workout will take the edge off.

Scott here, Captain. No problem, sir. You'll have it. He ran in, said you wanted us on the Bridge. And he shut the door behind us and locked off the mechanism. I can't. He's hooked everything through the main panel in there. Get up to my office and pull the plans for this bulkhead. The only way to get that door open is to cut through these wall circuits here.

I can't change the laws of physics. I've got to have thirty minutes. Captain's Log, supplemental. The Enterprise, spiraling down out of control. Ship's outer skin heating rapidly due to friction with planet atmosphere. Maybe twenty two, twenty three minutes. Captain, you can't mix matter and antimatter cold. We'd go up in the biggest explosion since That's only a theory. It's never been done. If you wanted to chance odds of ten thousand to one, maybe, assuming we had a row of computers working weeks on the right formula. Engineers, man your stations. Engine rooms, report.

182,TOS,episode 4,KIRK,"Kirk, affirmative. What caused it? Captain here. Better have Medicine look them over too. Tell Mister Spock I'll meet him there in ten minutes. Kirk out. How are they? You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here. You keep wondering, you keep signing on. Any guesses, Mister Spock? Any idea of what happened down there? You'd better get some rest. Set up those tapes, Mister Spock. We'll see if the answers are there. Almost as though they were irrational, drugged. An engineer sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything. A woman strangled. A crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand. And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower. If the image wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable. Not even a theory, gentlemen? Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the breakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew? The purpose of a briefing, gentlemen, is to get me answers based on your abilities and experience. In a critical orbit, there's no time for surprise. Kirk here. On our way, Lieutenant. I'll hold you to that half second, Scotty. Compensate, Mister Riley. Mister Spock? Good. Tormolen's record? Was he trying to kill himself? Doesn't sound like the man I know. What is it? Compensate. Compensate. Uhura, monitor communications. Tell McCoy I'll be there when I can. Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it. Engine room from Bridge. Tie into the helm, Scotty. If we should call for power, we'll want it fast. Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock. That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact. Coincidence? Maybe. That's exactly what I was going to ask. That's not good enough. Bones, I want the impossible checked out too. What were their symptoms? Irrational, or drugged. Security, Lieutenant Uhura. Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine. I want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked. Put Security on it. Present condition of Psi 2000. Helmsman, stabilise position. Warp us out of here. Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit. Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her. Sulu, put that put that thing away. I'd like you to teach me that sometime. Scotty, we need power. Engine room, acknowledge! Who's this? This is Captain Kirk. Get out of the engine room, navigator. Where's Mister Scott? Clear that tube, will you? And burn up. I know, Mister Spock. How did Riley get in there? He's cut off both helm and power. Can't you get to the auxiliary? Continue the alert, Lieutenant. Cut him off. Can you tie me in to the Sickbay? Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor. Is there any way, anything you can do to snap him out of it? Please, not again. Get me Sickbay. See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead. Get him out of here. Take the helm. Take the helm! At least try cutting him off! Sorry. Scotty. We've got twelve minutes left. It'll take at least two or three of them to get the engines up to power now. Call me when you've cut through. I want to be there. Kirk out. Follow me through. Put your phasers on stun. Don't fire unless he's armed. Go. Get him out of here. Scotty, we haven't got much time left. Kirk here. What is it? Scotty! Scotty, we've got six. We can balance our engines into a controlled implosion. Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet? Where have you been? What happened? We've got four minutes, maybe five. We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off. No time to regenerate them. Do you hear me? We've got to risk a full-power start! You've got to hear me! We need a formula. We've got to risk implosion! We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance. Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's possible. We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand chance! Yes, I found Mister Spock! I'm talking to Mister Spock, do you understand? I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't permit me my life. I've got to live hers. I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock? You're allowed to notice her. The Captain's not permitted Now I know why it's called she. Flesh woman to touch, to hold. A beach to walk on. A few days, no braid on my shoulder. Scotty, help. I've got to hang on. Tell them. Clear the corridors, the turbo lift. Hurry. Never lose you. Never. Bridge. Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course. Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came. No beach to walk on. Engage. Are you? Checked elapsed time, Mister Sulu. Time warp. We're going backward in time. Helm, begin reversing power. Slowly. Engines ahead. Warp one. Mister Spock. The time warp. What did it do to us? Not those last three days. We may risk it someday, Mister Spock. Resume course to our next destination, Mister Sulu.

Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man, demanded brandy. Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain, I'll get back to my work. Captain. Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters. You can go now, Yeoman. There's only one logical answer. We have an impostor aboard. Captain's Log, stardate 1672.9. On the planet's surface, temperatures are beginning to drop, our landing party there in growing jeopardy. Due to the malfunction of the ship's transporter, an unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists. About your double, Captain. We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you. How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are to capture you? The search parties, Captain. Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew. You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect. If you do, they lose faith, and you lose command. Understood, Captain. Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Something has happened to me. Somehow, in being duplicated, I have lost my strength of will. Decisions are becoming more and more difficult. About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and locked. Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They won't operate. Spock here. Acknowledged. Continue the search. Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search? Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill. What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get some help, Captain? Captain, you ordered me to tell you. Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision. Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness. Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that. If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand it's the way I am. This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures, Mister Sulu. Captain Kirk. Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We think we may have found an answer. We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through. Captain. It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes. Energise. Reverse. The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him. For once, I agree with you. No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror. It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear. Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left? Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well. Are you relinquishing your command, Captain? Captain, I thought the plan We'll let the captain handle this. You'll have to hold on to him, Captain. Captain? Understood, Captain. Ready. Right away, Captain. All sections report ready, sir. Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir? The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, Yeoman?"

Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go. He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a tranquilizer of any kind. I think we'd better bind him. You have a point, Spock? It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that, Spock? You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that! Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process. A fact I failed to consider. I don't know, Jim. Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll join you. Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our darker side. We need it! It's half of what we are. It's not really ugly, it's human. Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him. You have the goodness. The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For you see, he was afraid and you weren't. He's dead, Jim. Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Entry made by Second Officer Spock. Captain Kirk retains command of this vessel, but his force of will rapidly fading. Condition of landing party critical. Transporter unit still under repair. Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know. Animal could have died of some kind of shock. I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem. Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again. Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway. Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory! Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours. No! He attacked him. Well, Mister Spock? Jim? Severe exposure and frostbite, but I think they'll make it. How do you feel, Jim?"

Temperature's still dropping. Now forty one degrees below zero. Do you think you might be able to find a long rope somewhere and lower us down a pot of hot coffee? Rice wine will do, if you're short on coffee. I think we ought to give room service another call. That coffee's taking too long. Enterprise, this is Sulu. Hot line direct to the Captain. Are we that far gone? Oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up. We're using hand phasers to heat the rocks. One phaser quit on us, three still operating. Any possibility of getting us back aboard before the skiing season opens down here? Per your training programme, Mister Spock. Captain K-Kirk, Sulu here. One hundred seventeen below. Can't last much longer. Can't see clearly, Doctor, to read top indicator. Think the cold penetrating communicator. Two men unconscious. No time. No. Can't wait. No time."
240,TOS,episode 5,SCOTT,"Right. Locked onto you. Energise. Coadjutor engagement. Magnetic. Decontaminate that uniform. That acted like a burnout. Just one moment, Captain. It checks out okay now. You better go get a synchronic meter so we can double-check. All right, Captain. Locked onto you. Are you all right, Captain? Let me give you a hand. Wilson will be right back, sir. Captain's Log, stardate 1672.1. Specimen-gathering mission on planet Alpha 177. Unknown to any of us during this time, a duplicate of me, some strange alter ego, had been created by the transporter malfunction. It might profit you to let Doctor McCoy give you the once-over. Transporter breakdown. Continue circuit testing. We beamed up this animal and, well, look for yourself. It's in this specimen case. A few seconds after they sent this one up through the transporter, that duplicate appeared. Except it's not a duplicate, it's an opposite. Two of the same animal, but different. One gentle, this. One mean and fierce, that. Some kind of savage, ferocious opposite. Captain, we don't dare send Mister Sulu and the landing party up. If this should happen to a man. I don't know sir, but when Fisher came up, his suit was covered with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties. It may have caused an overload. Can't tell, not yet. Yes sir, but we don't dare bring up the landing party. It might be duplicated like this animal. Can't say, sir. We're doing everything we can, sir. Captain Kirk. Mister Scott, sir, on the lower level of the Engineering deck. I've found a new trouble with the transporter. The casing has a wide gap ripped in it. The main circuits have been burned through. The abort control circuit is gone altogether. Scott here, Captain. The transporter unit ioniser. Nothing much left of it, sir. We can't repair it in less than a week. Captain's Log, stardate 1673.5. Transporter still inoperable. My negative self is under restraint in Sickbay. My own indecisiveness growing. My force of will steadily weakening. On the planet, condition critical. Surface temperature is seventy five degrees below zero, still dropping. We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir. I'll grab him by the scruff of the neck and hold him as long as I can. If this doesn't work, I don't know what will."
241,TOS,episode 5,KIRK,"That should make a good specimen. Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero. What happened? Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay. Captain Kirk ready to beam up. Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy. I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the transporter room unattended. Thank you. All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to. Thank you, Yeoman. That's all. Saurian brandy. Back to duty status, Fisher. I have no sympathy for clumsiness. I said, give me the brandy! Yeah. Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it? Like what? That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it? Our good doctor's been putting you on again. I'll tell him you were properly annoyed. What is it, Scotty? Yes? Oh, my. Jim will do here, Janice. You're too beautiful to ignore. Too much woman. We've both been pretending too long. Stop pretending. Let's stop pretending. Come here, Janice. Don't fight me. Don't fight me, Janice. Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting here since you left me. Alone, Mister Spock. Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's going on. Sickbay. Us? Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any scratches? Yeoman. I was in my room. It wasn't me. Fisher saw? It wasn't me! Do you know what you're saying? How did all this happen? Does the transporter work at all? How long will it take you to find the trouble? We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark. They'll die. The surface temperature of that planet goes down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night. Yes, I know, Scotty. Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister Spock. Organise search parties. Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed. The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked, on setting number one. There can't be any chance of him being killed. He's to be taken without. If the men are forced to fire, he can't be killed. Tell them. Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know. Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock. What I don't know is why I forgot that just now. Mister Spock, if you see me slipping again, your orders, your orders are to tell me. This is the Captain speaking. There's an impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me and is pretending to be me. This man is dangerous. Utmost caution is to be observed. All crew members are to arm themselves. The impostor may be identified by scratches on his face. Repeat, the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face. Section chiefs, assign personnel to the search. All search parties report to Mister Spock for assignment. Something? Oh, yes, yes. All hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force. The impostor is not to be injured. Use minimum force. Repeat, the imposter I'm Captain Kirk! Is not to be injured. I'm Captain Kirk. I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! Wilson! Wilson, give me your phaser. How have you been? How's it going down there, Mister Sulu? Isn't there any way we can help them? Then we've got to get those men up. We've got to find him before he, but how? The lower levels. The Engineering deck. No. I don't want anyone else to see the Mister Spock, if I'm to be the Captain, I've got to act like one. You can't hurt me. You can't kill me. You can't. Don't you understand? I'm part of you. You need me. I need you. I don't need you. Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me? What is your point, Mister Spock? For how long? Kirk here. We've located the trouble. It shouldn't be much longer. I'll see what we can do. Engineering deck, Kirk here. That unit, Scotty, status report. How bad is it? Kirk here, Mister Sulu. I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store. How is it down there? What happened? He's not dying? Yes, he is. Help me. How can he die? Can I survive without him? Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it! I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without him. I don't want him back. He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me. Me. Human. What do I have? Not enough. I have a ship to command. Kirk here. Coming. What is it? Yes, yes. Go ahead. Don't hurt him. Yes, yes, that sounds likely. Get the transporter room ready. That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check everything. No, I don't think I've for Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones. Their lives Help me. Somebody make the decision. No. No, I'm not. Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the autopsy. Kirk here. Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die. What are you going to do? Go through the transporter, both of us. There's nothing I can do to stop you. It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to do. I won't fight you anymore. Oh, I feel so weak. I'll be glad when this is over. Janice, hello. Yeoman, I owe you an explanation. Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later? Bridge. Prepare to leave orbit, Mister Farrell. Well? I gave you an order, Mister Farrell. They can't be saved. Prepare to leave orbit. I've changed my mind. Man your station, Mister Spock. Grab him. He's the impostor. McCoy, he's fooled you. Mister Spock, you know who I am. You know what that is. I'm the captain. Isn't that obvious? Look at his face. Remember the scratches? Look how he's tried to hide them. He wants you to think that he's Captain Kirk. You know who I am. Yes, I know. You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him. He'll destroy the ship! I'm the Captain. Don't you understand? I'm captain of the ship! I'm the captain! This is my ship! My ship! It's mine! I'll kill you. Can half a man live? Take another step, you'll die. Then we'll both die. Please, I don't want to. Don't make me. Don't make me. I don't want to go back. Please! I want to live! You will. Both of us. I want to live! Mister Spock. If this doesn't work. Mister Spock. Get those men aboard fast. How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see. Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us. The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him. Thank you, Yeoman. This is the Captain speaking. Navigator, set in course correction.

Schiller rating three five. Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating. How many more in your crew? What's wrong? It'll take longer on battery power. Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh? No other crewmen? You can explain that to the Captain. Deck twelve. The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain. I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. Better rig a by-pass circuit. Needed on the bridge, Captain. The entire ship's power is feeding through one lithium crystal. And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power through it. There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore, I've heard. Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel. Rigel 12, Mister Farrell. You have the course. Captain's log, Stardate 1329.2. On board the U. S. S. Enterprise, a ship's hearing is being convened against the transport vessel's captain. I'm becoming concerned about the almost-hypnotic effect produced by the women. State your name for the record. Your correct name. State your correct name for the record. Any past offenses, Mister Mudd? We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours. Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful. Destroying them was a shame.  Conserving batteries, sir. Half power. We don't have the time to spare, Captain. The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult to probe through it. Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid zero four zero. There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove. Mudd? Spock here, Captain. How many coming, Captain? I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode. The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end."

Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound, measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is it that they just, well, act beautiful. No. Strike that, strike that. You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing? No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going beep! I don't either.

If we don't get them over here right now Only one, sir, but we've locked onto three more. I don't know, sir. With those three lithium crystals gone Not yet, sir, but we've hooked onto something. Oh, er, four in all, sir. We've got trouble, Mister Spock. One lithium crystal left, and that with a hairline split at the base. Can't. We blew the whole converter assembly. We burned them all out when we super-heated. That jackass Walsh not only wrecked his vessel, but in saving his skin But it's frustrating. Almost a million gross tons of vessel depending on a hunk of crystal the size of my fist. Our last crystal, sir. It's gone. It'll get us to Rigel 12, sir, but it'll be a shaky orbit. I'll get you there. Captain, this is draining our batteries further. If we only had those crystals. About five hours, sir. Captain's log. Have expended all but forty three minutes of power.

If you don't start beaming that crew over soon Scotty, we're getting a distress signal. Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard? Bridge to transporter room. Their vessel has been hit by an asteroid. It's gone. Did you get the crew off? Kirk to transporter room. Report. Bridge to transporter room. Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell. Save the power. Captain to transporter room. Are you reading me or not, Mister Scott? Bridge to transporter room. How many did we get off? If that captain can walk, I want him in my cabin immediately. Correction, I want him there whether he can walk or not. Kirk out. Come. Good. Now, if you don't mind telling And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain? Your name, please. Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions. Mister Spock will supply you with any legal information you may need for your defence. And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each other. Security! Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters. Confine him there. Kirk here. Well, switch to by-pass circuits. If it makes you feel better, Engineer, that's one jackass we're going to see skinned. Well, Mister Spock? Location and distance. Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock. This hearing is convened. Stardate 1329.2, on board starship U. S. S. Enterprise. Formal hearings against transport captain Leo Walsh. Start computer. Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation. You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's license. Destination and purpose of journey? Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what? Data on witnesses. Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings? Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record. Did these ladies come voluntarily? The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a vessel. Do you have any defence to offer? The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity. Miss McHuron, if you don't mind Mister Spock. Miss McHuron, would you mind. Mister Spock, will you contact the miners on Rigel 12? Notify them that we'll need the lithium crystals immediately upon arrival. As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do. Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the ladies with you, its, er Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is. Neither have I. Miss McHuron, I don't I asked for a preorbital course, Mister Farrell. That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen. We're down to battery power, and we're low on that. Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty. That's all we need. Ridiculous. What are we running here. Did you examine them? Did you examine Eve? Well, come on, you're the doctor. What is it? Is it that we're tired, and they're beautiful? They are incredibly beautiful. What are they? I asked you first. I don't follow you. Lay in. Computer? More than enough time. Communications, have a representative of the Rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs. Beam him up first pass over their camp. Not at all, Mister Spock. The choice was burning this lithium crystal or the destruction of another man's ship. Come. Good. Show them in. I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise. This is my science officer Mister Spock. Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price. What did you have in mind? Is there anything else? No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider those facts too? It's still no deal. All right, Childress, you've won. Now I'll take the lithium crystals. Childress. You got a better idea? Just have those crystals here when I get back. Eve! Eve! Captain's log. Have transported aboard the Enterprise to implement search with infrared scanners and sensing system. Magnetic storms on the planet's surface are cutting down speed and efficiency of our equipment. Search now in progress for three hours, eighteen minutes. But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way. Satisfied, Mister Scott? Has Childress reported in yet? Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left? Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room. The name of this game. Sit down. Tell him. Tell him, Harry. The Venus drugs, Harry. Oh, it exists, illegally. He gave it to the women before you met them. They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress. They're married. Subspace radio marriage. It was a fraud. They can get out of it. Quite a woman, eh, Childress? By herself. She took no drug. Coloured gelatin. There's only one kind of woman. You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk. Stand by. Do I beam down a search party? Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium crystals. Eve? Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd. I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness at your trial. If you think that'll help. Why should I work your side of the street? Ahead full."

It's all right, darlings. We're in good hands. That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't he?

Eh, mister? You'll never take that out of them. You're part Vulcanian, aren't you. Ah well then, a pretty face doesn't affect you at all, does it. That is, unless you want it to. You can save it, girls. This type can turn himself off from any emotion. I'll handle the conversation, darling. Well, no, Captain. This is me cargo. Captain's log, Stardate 1329.1. We've taken aboard from unregistered transport vessel its captain and, and three unusual females. These women have a mysterious magnetic effect on the male members of my crew, including myself. Explanation unknown at present. Well, how the devil am I supposed to know this is a starship, Captain? Here I am with a cargo of young lovelies. A strange ship comes up alongside. Well. naturally I did my best to evade you. And starship Captain or no, you exceeded your authority when you drove me and mine into a shower of asteroids. Walsh. Leo Walsh. You destroyed me ship, Captain. You're a hard-nosed one, Captain. Shh! Calm down now, darlings. Would you mind waiting outside? Well, now, answer every question they put to you. Don't lie. Well, you've no need to, have you, and don't submit to a med. That is, being so healthy, they've no need for a medical exam, have they. They won't. Have you no place to go lads?

I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task. You see, gentlemen, just as I told you. Three lovely ladies destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men, to supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed. A wife, a home, a family. Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred public trust. I've devoted me whole life to it. Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it. Well, of course!

Lonely, isolated, overworked, rich lithium miners! Girls, do you still want husbands, hmm? Evie, you won't be satisfied with a mere ship's captain. I'll get you a man who can buy you a whole planet. Maggie, you're going to be a countess. Ruth, I'll make you a duchess. And I, I'll be running this starship. Captain James Kirk, the next orders you're taking will be given by Harcourt Fenton Mudd! Captain's log-- Stardate 1330.1. Position, fourteen hours out of Rigel 12. We're on auxiliary impulse engines. Fuel low, barely sufficient to achieve orbit over the planet. Lithium replacements are now imperative. The effect of Mudd's women on my crew continues to grow, still totally unexplained. Harry Mudd is confined to his quarters under guard. Just three? You're sure? Later, dear, later. Magda, did you get to your communications man? And they've been there? Perfect. Perfect. Three of them and three lovely ladies has Harry Mudd. And lithium crystals, my dear, are worth three hundred times their weight in diamonds, thousands of times their weight in gold. No, my dears.

You'll find out that Ship's captains are already married, girl, to their vessels. You'd find out the first time you came between him and the ship. You'll see. I didn't hide them, girl. I put them in a safe place in case I was searched. Mattress! Yes, here! Go on, Eve. Take it. It's not a cheat. It's a miracle for some man who can appreciate it and who needs it. Come along, ladies, come along. You must be Ben Childress. Come on now, girls, come on. I'm told they have only three days of orbit left before they start spiraling in. I do hate to see you suffering such a situation, Captain, but truth is truth, and the sad fact is you will deal. Sooner or later, you'll have to. Captain's log. Transporting down to surface of planet Rigel 12 to acquire replacement lithium crystals. Expect further difficulty from miners. Thank heaven you found her. Ah. Yes, well. Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug. Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have. Well, with men, it makes them more muscular. Women, rounder. Men, more aggressive. Women, more feminine, and Mister Childress, I If they want to. You can't condemn the women. Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that. Or man, for that matter.

We've got men willing to be our husbands waiting for us, and you're taking us in the opposite direction! Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls or something. And what about us? What happens to us? Help us, please. All of us. Captain? I hope you don't mind. I was trying to take a walk, and I just, I just had to run in someplace. You see, all your men were looking at me, following me with their eyes. They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness. I, I suppose you understand it even more, having to run a huge ship like this with so much responsibility every minute and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you. Hmm! I read once that a commander has to act like a paragon of virtue. I never met a paragon. Well, of course not. No one is. But some people try to pretend. Do you, Captain? Oh, no! Oh, I just can't do it. I don't care what Harry Mudd says. I do like you, but I just can't go through with it. I hate this whole thing! I don't like you, and I'm not very happy with myself, either. We're supposed to notice them! Oh, oh Harry, I don't feel very good. I think it must be near the time. You'll never find them, Harry, and if you do find them you know what they are. A cheat. If you care for someone, really care No, I No. I'm sorry, I guess it must be the dust. Why don't you run a raffle and the loser gets me? I ate some of your food, so I paid with some chores. Oh, the sound of male ego. You travel halfway across the galaxy, and it's still the same song. There. You going to eat or talk? Well you're tasting some of it now. I couldn't scrape three layers of your leavings out of that pan. Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand blast it clean, or hadn't you thought about that? Double jack. Not in double jack. I got tired of you. I slumped. Harmless! Yes, that's what it means! You don't want wives, you want this. This is what you want, Mister Childress. I hope you remember it and dream about it, because you can't have it. It's not real! Is this the kind of wife you want, Ben? Not someone to help you, not a wife to cook and sew and cry and need, but this kind. Selfish, vain, useless. Is this what you really want? All right, then. Here it is. I swallowed it.

KIRK2 No problems here, sir. KIRK2 Security, Spock here. Status of your landing party? Have them meet me in the transporter room after the Captain has beamed down. KIRK2 Captain Kirk! Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Doctor Korby? Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term half-breed, Captain. You must admit it is an unsophisticated expression."

It's been five years since his last message. Put it on all frequencies, Lieutenant. But the surface temperature of that planet is one hundred degrees below zero. Required reading at the academy, Mister Spock. I've always wanted to meet him. Do you think there's any chance of him still being alive? Keep trying. And since then two expeditions have failed to find him. Enterprise to Korby. We have your co-ordinates pin-pointed. We're preparing to beam down a party. It may interest you that we have aboard this vessel The man making it is Doctor Roger Korby. Agreed, Doctor. However, there will be two of us. We're on our way, Doctor. We'll be with you in a moment. Enterprise out. Energise. Doctor Korby? Doctor Korby. It's possible we may have hit the wrong entry point. Kirk to Enterprise. Beam down two security men. Some delay in meeting us. Probably nothing at all. Kirk out. Corridors could be quite deep. Getting here may have taken more time than he estimated. Don't worry. Rayburn, maintain post here. Matthews, we'll look for Doctor Korby. Accompany us. Is that you, Doctor Korby? Is there a path down there? Any chance of a projection or a ledge? Not soon enough. You do know him well? An old friend? Captain Kirk to Rayburn. Report. We lost Matthews. Apparently an accident. Tell the Enterprise to have a full security party standing by. And we'll both report in at hourly intervals. If you and I lose contact, or if he fails to hear from either of us, he's to beam the security party down immediately. Kirk out. Where is Doctor Korby? There's no need to apologise, sir, and certainly no need to introduce yourself. It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to make a security confirmation. When I call my ship, if you list your personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs Rayburn, are you receiving? I've lost contact with my guard. I'm required to call my ship. Sir, one man is dead. I've lost contact with the other. What are you doing? Drop it! Enterprise from Captain Kirk. Come in. Do you read? Contact established with Doctor Korby. No problem, Mister Spock. Bear with me. Yes, I know your reputation. The whole galaxy knows who you are and what you stand for. That's why all this makes no sense. Or disobey an order from her. Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced? A simple layman's question, Doctor. Where is my other crewman? Alive? Dead? Where is my other crewman? He's an android like Brown? You've convinced me, Doctor. You've convinced me that you're dangerous. If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you programme them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor. Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear? Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed As far as I know. Well, there's one difference between us. I'm hungry. KIRK2 Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never know. KIRK2 He's an exact duplicate? What about memory? Tell me about Sam. KIRK2 He saw me off on this mission. KIRK2 He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research station. KIRK2 Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences. Programming. Different word, but the same old promises made by Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis. It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness, sentiment. The other side of the coin, Doctor. All you wanted before was my understanding. Yes, yes. No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds. You've created your own Kirk. Why do you need me? I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think! Stand back, Ruk! I'll kill him! Stay back. Christine, is that you? Andrea, kiss me. What's the matter, Andrea? Confused? Emotion, Ruk? You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my life? Why? Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that? What happened to the old ones, Ruk? Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them? And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve. And Korby? The danger to you is Korby. The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to destroy them. That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to destroy you! You were a man with respect for all things alive. How can I explain the change in you? If I was to tell Earth I was in your hands, to tell them what has become Spock. He must've got my message. She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk. Is this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another? Aren't you doing exactly what you hate most in humans, killing with no more concern than when you turn off a light? Then prove it. Give me that phaser gun. If there's any human left in you, give it to me. Andrea, give me the weapon. In here, Spock. Doctor Korby was never here. She's staying with the ship. Something bothering you, Mister Spock? I'll remember that Mister Spock, the next time I find myself in a similar situation. Steady as we go, helm. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Roger, that Where is Captain Kirk? Yes, I am concerned. Yes, let's start with Andrea. How convenient. Given a mechanical Doctor Brown, a mechanical geisha would be no more difficult. Did you? Roger, what's happened to you? When I sat in your class, you wouldn't even dream of harming an insect or an animal. Their life was sacred to you then. I don't know. They're exact. I honestly don't know. Are you all right? Yes, thank you. Captain. KIRK2 No, I'm not torn. I'm puzzled. I'm worried. KIRK2 Nothing he hasn't told you. I know it doesn't make sense. What he's done may seem wrong, but he is Roger Korby, whatever he seems to be doing. KIRK2 No. You're forgetting how well I know him. He's as sane as you or I. KIRK2 Please, don't ask me to make that choice. I'd much rather you push me off the same precipice where Matthews died. Oh, I can't. Please, go ahead and eat. KIRK2 Roger, I. Ruk, no! Ruk, stop! Doctor Korby said you are to obey me! Ruk! Ruk! Ruk, I order you not to harm him! Are you, Roger? But he'll never find us in this maze. Don't you see, Roger?

We appreciate you bringing Roger's fiancee to him. But you are exactly as Roger described you. No wonder he missed you so. I do not understand. Why are you unhappy? You are with Roger again. You are concerned about the captain? How can you love Roger without trusting him? Why does it bother you when I use the name Roger? Yes, Doctor Korby. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, darling. As you can see, Captain Kirk is fine. He won't be harmed. The things at stake here simply make it necessary he doesn't send a report to his ship. I need time to explain and demonstrate to him and to you. Now shall we start with Andrea? I'm like Doctor Brown, an android. Didn't you know? I am now programmed to please you also. Is the food appealing? Please sit, Captain. KIRK2 Doctor Korby suggested that you have lunch. He thought you might have a few things to talk about. No. Not programmed for you. No. Yes, Doctor. I will find Ruk. I will kiss you. KIRK2 You, you will not? KIRK2 He freed himself, and I destroyed, destroyed him. I am not programmed for alarms. I listened to your instructions. They were mis-stated. No. Protect. Protect. To love you. To, to kiss you. Love you. Kiss."
425,TOS,episode 7,MATTHEWS,"Yes, sir."
426,TOS,episode 7,RUK,"We'll return to the ship within forty eight hours. Doctor Korby's records and specimens will require careful packing. Fine, Mister Spock. Doctor Korby has made some fascinating discoveries. All under control. Stand by for regular contact. Kirk out. You must be Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Christine, it's all right now. Yes Roger, everything is all right now. More complex than Brown. Much superior. I was left here by the old ones. Captain Kirk, where are you? Captain Kirk! I can help you! To maintain your existence would be illogical. So long ago. Yes, the old ones. The ones who made us. They grew fearful of us. They began to turn us off. Yes. Yes, it had been so long ago, I had forgotten. The old ones here. The ones who made us, yes. Yes, it is still in my memory banks. It became necessary to destroy them. You are inconsistent. You cannot be programmed. You are inferior. You came from the outside. You bring disorder here. I was programmed by Korby. I cannot harm him. That was the equation! Existence! Survival must cancel out programming. You brought him among us. You brought the inferior ones. We had cleansed ourselves of them. Now you bring the evil back!"
427,TOS,episode 7,RAYBURN,"Yes, sir. All quiet here at the entry, Captain. Any problems there, sir? Yes, sir."
428,TOS,episode 7,KORBY,"Enterprise, come in, Enterprise. This is Roger Korby. Repeating, this is Doctor Roger Korby. Do you read me, Enterprise? This is Doctor Roger Korby standing by. Captain's log, Stardate 2712.4. A signal from planet Exo 3. Doctor Roger Korby has been located, he and part of his expedition remaining alive due to the discovery of underground ruins Ieft by the former inhabitants of this world. I've a rather unusual request, Captain Kirk. Beam down alone, just yourself. We've made discoveries of such a nature they may require an extraordinary decision from you. Christine! Darling, how, Where are you? Yes, yes, by all means, Captain. I, I had no idea, no hope. Darling, are you all right? Here, Captain. I, I've been looking forward to Everything's all right now. Oh, forgive me, Captain. I'm, er, I'm Roger Korby. What? How did it happen? I'm terribly sorry, Captain. Perhaps if I'd been there. I know the passages so well. Captain, I'd much prefer I'd prefer you waited, Captain, please, till I've talked to you. I'm sorry. If they should send down more people, He won't be harmed. I promise you. Isn't it possible there could be things here unknown to you, so terribly important Andrea. This is necessary, Captain. You will understand. Andrea. If you move or cry out, Ruk may injure you. At least wait until we can talk. This is not a vain display, Captain. I'm a scientist. You obviously know my reputation. Trust me. There's so much you must learn Before you make a final judgment. For example Andrea. You see, Captain? That's enough. You are not to mock Christine. You will never harm her. You will not disobey her orders. Satisfied, Captain Kirk? Both love and trust. Now, give me twenty four hours to convince you. What would your first duty be upon return to your vessel? Report! Do you realise the number of discoveries lost because of superstition, of ignorance, of a layman's inability to comprehend? Ruk was programmed to protect my experiments. The logic of his machine mind saw danger to me. Ruk destroyed them both, totally against my wishes I assure you. Ruk was still tending the machinery when we arrived here. How many centuries? Even Ruk doesn't know. With his help, ith the records I could find, we built Brown. Ruk, no! Andrea, it's sufficient that it does disturb her. You will call me Doctor Korby from now on, Andrea. Remarkable, isn't she? Notice the the lifelike pigmentation, the variation in skin tones. The flesh, the flesh has warmth. There's even a pulse, physical sensation. Christine, you must realise an android's like a computer. It does only what I programme. As a trained scientist yourself, you must realise that You think I could love a machine? Andrea's incapable of that. She simply obeys orders. She has no meaning for me. There's no emotional bond. Andrea, kiss Captain Kirk. Now strike him. You see? There's no emotion in it, no emotional involvement. She simply responds to orders. She's a totally logical computer. A thing is not a woman. Now do you understand? I will answer all of your questions now. This is how you make an android. Andrea. He's not being harmed, I promise. Christine, if I'd simply beamed up to their vessel with Brown and the others, I'd have given them objects of curiosity, beginnings of wild stories, foolish theories. Ruk! Watch carefully. Choose, Christine. Which is your captain? Synthetic organs are in place. We merely synchronise them with Kirk's autonomic nervous system, duplicating the rhythms of his body. At the same time, we duplicate the mental pattern. Now, physical pattern complete, we now make a mental pattern. Ready for final synaptic fusion. Andrea, stand by for cortex circuits. The android will be so perfect It could even replace the captain. The same memories, the same attitudes, the same abilities. Activate circuits. Complete. Now, meet an android. KIRK2 He even has your sense of humour. One at a time, gentlemen. Captain? In every detail. You might as well try to outthink a calculating machine. Totally unimportant ones. You may leave now. You haven't guessed the rest? Not even you, Christine? What you saw was only a machine, Only half of what I could've accomplished, Do you understand? By continuing the process I could've transferred you, your very consciousness into that android. Your soul, if you wish. All of you. In android form, a human being can have practical immortality. Can you understand what I'm offering mankind? Can you understand that a human converted to an android can be programmed for the better? Can you imagine how life could be improved if we could do away with jealousy, greed, hate? No one need ever die again. No disease, no deformities. why even fear can be programmed away, replaced with joy. I'm offering you a pracical heaven, a new paradise, and all I need is your help. I need transportation to a planet colony with proper raw materials. I'm sure there are several good possibilities among your next stops. No diversion from your route. I want no suspicions aroused. I'll begin producing androids carefully, selectively. They must be strongly infiltrated into society before the android existence is revealed. I want no wave of hysteria to destroy what is good and right. You with me, Captain? I created him to impress you, not to replace you. Ruk, protect! A small colony. Abundant raw materials. You made a good beginning, Captain. KIRK2 Ruk, I would like Ruk, stop! Your programming. I had no choice. It's still me, Christine. Roger. I'm in here. You can't imagine how it was. I was frozen, dying. My legs were gone. I was, I had only my brain between life and death. This can be repaired easier than another man can set a broken finger. I'm still the same as I was before, Christine, perhaps even better. Andrea. There's someone in the outer junction. Ruk has been shut off. Get a weapon. Deal with it. Protect. I'm the same! A direct transfer. All of me, human, rational, and without a flaw. I'm not a computer. Test me. Ask me to solve any, equate, transmit. Christine, Christine, let me prove myself. Does this make such a difference? I am Roger Korby! No. You will never understand. I constructed a perfect being, tested it, proved it. Proved it. Proved it? No. You cannot love. You're not human."
429,TOS,episode 7,BROWN,"Be careful. There's no hope, Captain. It's bottomless. He must have slipped. None, Captain. Unfortunate. Terribly unfortunate. Doctor Korby was detained. I came as soon as I could. Explain. Christine. You look well. My name is Brown, Doctor Korby's assistant. I presume you are Captain Kirk. He's dead, I assure you. Come, Doctor Korby will be waiting. Doctor Korby has discovered that as their sun dimmed, the inhabitants of this planet moved underground from an open environment to this dark world. When you were a student of his, Christine, you must have often heard Doctor Korby remark how freedom of movement and choice produced the human spirit. The culture of Exo 3 proved his theory. When they moved from light to darkness, they replaced freedom with a mechanistic culture. Doctor Korby has been able to uncover elements of this culture which will revolutionise the universe when freed from this cavernous environment. The captain lost a man in the caverns, Doctor. The pit near the outer junction. The edge must have given way. No communications, Captain."

It's spheroid-shaped, circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles. Mass six times ten to the twenty first power tons. Mean density five point five one seven. Atmosphere oxygen, nitrogen. Affirmative, Captain. More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately 1960. Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking place on this planet for at least several centuries. Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the distress signal is automated. Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion. About three hundred years. Right, Captain. Guards! Cover me. Children, Captain. Lots of them. We couldn't begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like animals. Only children. Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages. Now there you have a museum piece, Doctor. Lens type, manually operated, light-activated. Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project. This was three hundred years ago, Captain. But children become adults. Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place upon entering puberty, are there not? Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter puberty, contract the disease? It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the streets. There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain. She's becoming a woman. Spock here. Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now. According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every one hundred years of real time. Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period, leaving only the children. Could very well be immensely old. Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them. Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice. Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman. Think about it. Acknowledged. This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree, but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we have. The ship's computers will verify my figures. Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left. The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the disease. I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship, and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain. I presume my calculations are correct. Spock here. Verified, Captain. We have seven days. Captain's Log, supplement. This is the second day of the seven left to us. We've found nothing. Enterprise is standing by with labs and computers ready to assist us. Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results. No, nothing. Communicators, Captain, they're gone. The nitrogen cycle, it has to be. That is a very good question. That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators. We've got to have those communicators, Jim. Without them, it could be a beaker full of death. We must. The vaccine could be fatal. Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress. Not yet. He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I found him. The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand the medical mind? Captain? Warp factor one, Captain. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

452,TOS,episode 8,MCCOY,"Now, this is marvellous. the most horrible conglomeration of antique architecture I've ever seen. Of course somebody will fix it. A seizure of some type. It's dead. It's incredible. Its metabolic rate. It's impossibly high as if it's burning itself up, almost as if it aged a century in just the past few minutes. I wonder what happened to her, that she should be so terrified of us. Foolie? You said the Grups got sick. Is that why there aren't any of them around? A plague, Captain. That could explain a lot of it. That creature which attacked us was certainly no child. Perhaps it died of the disease the girl's talking about. A veritable zoo of bacteria. Beam down a biocomputer and a portable electronic microscope. If I'm dealing with viruses, I'll need better equipment than I have here. I don't know. Probably the little bugs or whatever they are have no appetite for green blood. Spare me the analysis, Mister Spock, please. It is enough that it works. Life prolongation. Didn't have much luck, did they? Captain's Log. Doctor McCoy's biocomputer and a portable electronic microscope have been beamed down from the Enterprise. They will be used in conjunction with computer banks on-board ship. Tubular with extreme multiplicability. Appear to have affinity for nucleic acids. Give me what you have. Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of course you know that. Why? Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be. But how do they keep the line going? She likes you, Jim. Answers it very well. A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us could have been just like Miri. A child entering puberty on this planet means a death sentence. Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other, till the last of us finally destroys himself. What about us? No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it. It's progressing. We'll begin to feel it inside soon. Intense fever, great pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision. Of course, those are the early symptoms. There'll be more. I think I've found it. Only one half intact. More or less. The idea was to create a new series of diseases, a chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the human cell immeasurably. Is that all, Captain? We have five days, you know. Jim, We've absolutely got to have those communicators. Without them, we don't have the computers, and without the computers, we don't have a chance. Captain's Log, stardate 2717.3. Three days, seven hours left to us. Investigation proves that the supply of food in the area is running dangerously low. Unless something is done, the children will starve in a few months. The disease is working on each of us according to Doctor McCoy's prediction. Our tempers are growing short, and We're no further along than we were two days ago. Would you like to take a crack at it? Jim, I found something! The last slide I examined, I failed to make the necessary adjustment. The slowing down of my own responses The disease, Captain, the one they created three hundred years ago. A chance. At least it's a race now, and we've just wasted a minute. It looks right. But the question is, what's the dosage? That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it without the ship's computers. That's what the computers will tell us. We can't wait for those communicators any longer. The disease certainly is. How long do we have left? Hours, minutes? How much longer do you want to wait? Spock! And truant officers, I presume."

In the distant reaches of our galaxy, we have made an astonishing discovery. Earth type radio signals coming from a planet which apparently is an exact duplicate of the Earth. It seems impossible, but there it is. Hold us in a fixed orbit, Mister Spock. Still no response, communications? We'll beam down. Alert security. Prepare to transport landing party to surface. We'll land in the vicinity of the distress signals now being received. Identical. Earth, as it was in the early 1900s. Mister Spock. But with the mind of a child. Bones, what is it? We want to help you. What is? Come on! How old is this thing? Come out. We mean you no harm. I'm not going to hurt you. I won't hurt you. I only want to talk to you. Come on. I won't hurt you. Come on. It's all right. Come on. Take the guards, have a look outside. Radioactive readings, chemical pollutions, any further sign of life. We didn't do anything like that. Well, of course not. We're here to help. What happened here? Where is everybody? No, I don't. Won't you tell me? What are Grups? You said something about the Grups doing bad things, yelling, hurting, burning. You're doing fine. But what about the children, the Onlies? Didn't the awful things affect them? More of you? How many? What's your name? Miri. A pretty name for a pretty young woman. Very pretty. Miri said all the adults died. There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our questions. Miri, do you know any buildings where the doctors used to work? Will you take me there? It's important. Please. Yes. It's Jim. Good. I like yours, too. I like you. I wouldn't lie to you. Why, thank you. Yes, Lieutenant? Under no circumstances do I want anyone to beam down from the ship. We can't take any chances with further contamination. My orders still stand, Lieutenant. You can help us best by clearing the computer banks and standing by. Kirk out. Bones, why do you think the symptoms haven't appeared in Mister Spock? Intermediate experimentation report project on life prolongation. All the adults are dead. Only the children are left alive. At least they have up to now. That would explain why there are no adults. Who die when they enter adolescence. Loneliness? I don't know, curiosity? I think children have an instinctive need for adults. They want to be told right and wrong. Try again. See if you can find anything outside. Hey, clean up that desk for me, will you? Thank you. That would certainly answer the question of what happened to their parents. I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman. It might not turn out to be very pretty. I don't think so. There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with children. Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children. We've got to do something about the others. You couldn't get close to the other kids? I'm going to try. Miri? Come here. You want to go someplace with me? Dead. I don't understand it. My phaser wasn't set to kill. We could use some more, if you don't mind. There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here? What about Miri? And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you. Of course, Mister Spock. We still don't know what we're fighting. Are You certain about the time we have left? Is there any possibility There's no data, no starting point. Janice, take Miri for a walk. But do you know what they were up to? You two will have to recreate their thinking. If you can isolate that virus, we'll be able to develop a vaccine. I know. The children! Anything? And you? Haven't you found a thing yet? We're all frightened. Never mind that, what did you find? Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice? Where is she? Has something happened to her? No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you see what's going on? I've got to find Janice. We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard. This is the vaccine? Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left. You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You, your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we succeed in what we're doing. You've seen your friends get it. Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing up the way you are. Don't you know why you don't like to play games anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a young woman, you get the disease. All of you. All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it. Look at it, Miri, it's in you! Listen to me. Listen to me! This isn't a game. It never was a game. Listen to me! You've got our communicators, the boxes we talk into. We need them to talk to the ship. No blah blah blah! Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you don't help us, there won't be any games anymore. There won't be anything. Nothing, no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever. Now listen to me. You've got to help us before it's too late. Let Janice go. Give me those communicators before it's too late. You've seen your friends change one by one as they grew up. Did you ever see one of them not change? One by one, they got the disease, and they became like, Iike those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise. One by one they changed and got the disease. The disease like I've got, like Miri has. You understand what I'm talking about. You're not babies. We can help you! It's waiting for you. It may only be a matter of months. Look at my arms! That's what's going to happen to you unless you let me help you. And the little ones. What's going to happen to them after you've gone, after you've turned into creatures like Louise? Oh, they'll still be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone. You've eaten it. Maybe six months left, that's all, and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them. They'll die, too. All right, you want a foolie? All right. I dare you, I double-dare you. Look at the blood on my face. Now look at your hands. Blood on your hands. Now who's doing the hurting? Not the Grups, it's you hurting, yelling, maybe killing, just like the Grups you remember and creatures you're afraid of. You're acting like them, and you're going to be just like them unless you let me help you. I'm a Grup, and I want to help you. I'm begging you, let me help you or there won't be anything left at all. Please. Three hours, eleven minutes left. Thank you, Lieutenant. Keep this channel open. Clear your computers. What happened to him? Look at his face. Just children, three hundred years old and more. I've already contacted Space Central. They'll send teachers, advisers. They'll be all right. Yes. I never get involved with older women, Yeoman. Mister Spock? Full ahead. Warp factor one."

They talk to the other Grups with these little boxes. Now, if they didn't have those little boxes, they'd be all alone, huh? No! It's not a game, it's real. They're dangerous, they're Grups. Don't you understand? All right, let's hide! That would be some foolie, Miri, but do you think it would work? But Grups, they know things and all that. You know, I bet they'll be able to do it with one person less. No, you got the wrong game. A teacher, I told you. Now, what does a teacher say, huh? It's a foolie. You think I'd tell you?

I don't know the rules. I've got to know the rules. A game, you know. You can't play a game without rules. Even Grups ought to know that. You are. They will, when Onlies get old.

That the blues blotches, characteristic of the unknown disease had appeared on each of us, with the exception of Mister Spock. There was a well-equipped laboratory in the building. Doctor McCoy took tissue samples of each of us in an attempt to isolate the organism responsible. It spreads real fast. I know. When you're old, it covers you like anything. All right, Jim. Sure. Her name was Louise. She was just a little bit older than I am when it happened. Oh, Jim. Are these enough, Jim? No, I don't mind. I know. I know. Don't you think I've heard them talk? They have such little time to do this dumb thing of theirs, this baninski thing. If we get her away. that Yeoman, that's one person less to start off with. It's easy. She's always asking me about the youngest little Onlies, little ones. What if they get sick, who takes care of them? Do they have enough to eat? Where do they sleep? I'll just tell her one of you fell down and got hurt. All right, you. Not one, two. Because he'll try to find her. The Captain. He'll try to find her, but he won't. Mister Lovey-dovey. What's the matter with you? How should I know? Don't you feel all right? Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you. I don't care. Sometimes it happens. That's not true. It just happens sometimes. No! No! No! I know. No. Listen to him. I did. Why do you think I brought him here? Tell them, Jim. No, please. No! Listen to him. He's telling the truth. Look at my arm, Jahn. It's happening to me.

I've been to those penal colonies since they've begun following his methods, and they're not cages anymore. They're clean, decent hospitals for sick minds. Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder. Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it up with the ship's surgeon. Stand by. Well, Bones, you've got the ball. You care to recommend a better place? An assumption, Doctor.

We arrived safely, and we're here with Doctor Adams right now. Kirk out. Before you came here May I ask what crime you committed? Quite a tour, Doctor. Very impressive. Doctor. Hmm? May I see it? Shall we leave it up to the doctor? One of the advantages of being a Captain, Doctor, is being able to ask for advice without necessarily having to take it. One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good How does it work? I didn't mean to suggest that he had. The reason I asked, sir, was you haven't mentioned where Doctor Van Gelder's injury occurred. Thank you. In Doctor Adams' study, Mister Spock. Why? Affirmative. Yes. He was injured there. I've seen the room. Doctor Adams explained the mistake Van Gelder made. Go ahead, Mister Spock. Anything further? Thank you, Doctor Adams. Stand by, Mister Spock. Doctor Adams has left with some things to attend to. What is it, Mister Spock? Tell McCoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists that any concern is unjustified. According to Adams, Van Gelder created his own problem. Not really. I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock. Affirmative. Kirk out. Good evening. What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon? I didn't. But a bit blank. I'd like to see that treatment room again. You say you're somewhat familiar with the theory behind it? And if he's lying, he'll continue to lie, and I won't find out a thing. The only way I can be sure is to see that machine at work, or is that too impractical and unscientific of me, Doctor? Well? I have no desire to damage my brain. Can this be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no? And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in the slightest? Mm-hmm. Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two. Nothing happened. Try a harmless suggestion. You know, when we finally get through this I'd like to locate and raid a kitchen somewhere. Remarkably effective for a device that Doctor Adams was going to abandon. Yes. Pick something unusual, an unusual suggestion, something we can both be sure of. Merry Christmas. My crew is sworn to secrecy. You want me to manufacture a lie, wrap it up as a Christmas present for you? Helen. For years, I've loved you. Helen! Helen, don't go! I need you, Helen! I must drop it. Kirk to Enterprise. Argh! Kirk to Enterprise. Argh! Helen. Helen, for years I've loved you. Helen. I've loved you. For years. Yes. Yes, I remember. I remember. Helen. Look. The duct. The duct. Give me a hand here. Pull. Air conditioning. It has to connect with other ducts and tunnels. You can get through this. It might lead to the power supply. Short-circuited, it would cut off the security force field. Have you had any training in hyper-power circuits? Megavoltage. Touch the wrong line, and you're dead. I believe in you. I trust you. I, argh, I don't know. I don't know. Helen, are you all right? Doctor Adams? Doctor A. The treatment room. Follow me. The power came on. But he was alone. Can you imagine the mind emptied by that thing? Without even a tormentor for company. Thank you. Not when you've sat in that room. Take us out of orbit, Mister Spock. Ahead warp factor one."

You dropped in Perhaps it would be simpler if you called me Helen, Captain, since Of course, Captain. I wouldn't recommend it for weak hearts. Perhaps you'll call me Helen, Doctor. With so many titles around, we're not going to be sure who's talking to who. Thank you. A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy. Captain, if something hasn't worked out and therefore has no scientific fact Since you brought me down here for advice, Captain Tranquillisers are fine, Captain, but to continually pump chemicals into a person's bloodstream Beam neutralising has been experimented with on Earth, Captain. I'm not acquainted with this particular style of equipment, but I can assure you that Doctor Adams has not created a chamber of horrors here. Oh, that's foolish. He's suffering from neuro-synapse damage, as if his brain were short-circuited. It's no wonder he's having delusions. Good evening. You could've waited until tomorrow morning to ask me that, Captain. I thought they were happy, well-adjusted. Captain, if you're questioning the methods of a man like Tristan Adams Yes, somewhat, but if you'd simply state any doubts you have to Doctor Adams Coming. Yes. Yes, Captain. I know my profession. Ready? We'll try minimum intensity, a second or two. We already tried it for that long, Captain. Something happened. Your face went completely blank. You're hungry. I put that suggestion in your mind, Captain. I said simply that you were hungry. I think we should try this again. At the Christmas party, we met, we danced, you talked about the stars. I suggest now that it happened in a different way. You swept me off my feet and carried me to your cabin. Captain, if your crew saw you carry me here. But my reputation. I mean, just having met like this. Of course, it would be different if you cared for me. No, I prefer honesty. No, Doctor! No! No. No! They've taken you from the room, Captain. You're in your own quarters now. Try to remember. He placed all that in your mind. Remember. Doctor Adams took the controls away from me. Do you remember the pain and then his voice? Remember? No. Anything's better than Adams' treatment room. Time for another treatment? Captain. Captain? Yes. This isn't right, Captain. Doctor Adams did this to you. The machine wasn't on high enough to kill. I understand."
613,TOS,episode 9,THERAPIST,"Quite simple. Off on switches, and the large control here changes the strength of the brain neutralising beam. You will forget all you have heard. To remember any portion of it, any word, will cause you pain, terrible pain, growing more terrible as you fight to remember."
614,TOS,episode 9,WOMAN,"Rehab colony. Come in. Enterprise, affirmative. Our security cover is now open. Tantalus cargo ready to beam up. Tantalus colony to Enterprise. We are unable to locate one of our inmates. This is a potentially violent case. Possibly hidden in the box we beamed up to you. Repeat, unable to locate one of our inmates. This is a potentially violent case. Tantalus. Stand by, Enterprise."
615,TOS,episode 9,ADAMS,"Tantalus colony. Adams here. Terribly sorry, Captain. I take all the blame. Let me repeat, he's clever as well as extremely violent. Take all possible precautions. Captain Kirk, Doctor Adams here. Is Doctor Van Gelder all right? And your people, no injuries? Yes, of course. You're certain he's all right? We've been very concerned. In the violent state he's in He'd been doing some experimental work, Captain, an experimental beam we'd hoped might rehabilitate incorrigibles. Van Gelder felt he hadn't the moral right to expose another man to something he hadn't tried on his own person. Yes, Captain. May I inquire about your patrol destinations? Are you passing near any hospital facilities superior to ours? I'd like Van Gelder to have the best possible treatment, of course. No need to apologise, Captain Kirk. In fact, I'd take it as a personal favour if you'd beam down and look into it yourself. I'm sure you realise we don't get too many visitors here. Oh, I, er, Captain, I would appreciate it if you could come down with a minimum staff. We're forced to limit outside contact as much as possible. Hello Captain Kirk, and er Thank you. Thank you, Captain. Welcome to Devil's Island, Doctor. I shall indeed. Won't you? No, no. That won't be necessary in your case, Captain. Just keep it out of sight, hmm? I know you people feel as naked without a weapon as we do without a medikit. A small toast. Do you mind? It's such a great day for us here on Tantalus when we have visitors, no matter what the excuse. Oh, now, Captain, you made your apology from upstairs. Now forget it. I don't think you'll be able to get through the security screen, Captain. Just a second, hmm? There. Now try it. Ah, Lethe, come in. Lethe, this is Captain Kirk and Doctor Helen Noel. Lethe came to us for rehabilitation and stayed on as a therapist, and a very good one too, I might add. Go right ahead, Captain. Um, part of our cure, if you will, Captain, is to bury the past. Why should a person go on living with unbearable memories if there's no necess. Oh, I feel quite sure that you'd concur with me in that, Doctor. Helen. Yes. And now to the toast, hmm? You'll forgive us, Lethe. There you are, Captain. To all mankind. May we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that, that we cannot fill them with love and warmth. Thank you. Hi, Carl. Yes? Ah. I was afraid you would ask about this, Captain. One doesn't like to talk about their personal failures, you know? It was just an experiment that went wrong, I'm afraid. I think I'll have to award that round to the Captain, Helen. You're fighting over your weight. All right, let's take a look. A neural neutraliser. Experimental. Actually, we don't expect to get much use out of it at all. That beam from above neutralises brain waves, relaxes the patient's mind. Does them no harm, of course, and the effects are only temporary. Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain? Hope. Yes, yes, there's always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more violent cases. Exactly my point, Helen. Yes. Shall we? Captain, you remind me of the ancient sceptic who demanded of the wise old sage to be taught all the world's wisdom while standing on one foot. Right here, Captain. Yes, Simon was a very stubborn man. He could've sat in that room for years with the beam at that volume or even higher. Or if he simply had someone standing by to snap it off in case he got into trouble, but, but no. He tried it alone and on full volume. It's a pity. Your Mister Spock sounds like a very excellent second in command, Captain Kirk. Please tell him to go ahead and speak freely. I have to check in with a member of my staff anyway. Excuse me. Now Captain Kirk is going to have a complete demonstration. I want there to be no doubts whatsoever in his mind. Mmm. You're madly in love with Helen, Captain. You'd lie, cheat, steal for her, sacrifice your career, your reputation. The pain. Do you feel it, Captain? You must have her, or the pain grows worse, the pain, the longing for her. For years, you've loved her, Captain, for years. You must continue to remember that, Captain. And now, she's gone. Now Captain, you must take your phaser weapon and drop it on the floor. Captain, the pain increases unless you obey me. Very good, Captain. Very good indeed. And now your communicator. Drop it on the floor. Please don't fight me, Captain. The pain only gets worse when you doubt me. You believe in me completely. You trust me completely. Excellent, Captain. I compliment you. Do you know Doctor Van Gelder was down on his hands and knees sobbing at this point? It was so gratifying. I'm so fortunate to have had a couple of excellent specimens to, to work with. I've learned a great deal. Notify security at once, Lethe. Where is she, Captain? Where is Helen And with what instructions? Put him back in the chair, Eli, and find that girl."
616,TOS,episode 9,GELDER,"Where's the captain? Which one of you is the captain? My name is Van Gelder. I want asylum. I want your promise first, your word that you won't take me back there, to Tantalus. No! No. No, I'm not going back! I'll disable your vessel first. You choose, Captain. I'll destroy your control panel. You smart, button-pushing brass hat. Wash your hands of it. Is that your system? You're both quite sure of yourselves, aren't you? Quite expert. Take him back.

Control panel. I see it. A device. A light! The light!  No! No, no, no. No! No. No, don't let them! You must warn your captain. No! No! Don't let him stay! Don't let him stay! Don't! No. No. Don't hypo me. Please, don't hypo me. I'll try not to fight. I'll try. But you must listen. Warn your Captain. Doctor Adams. Doc, Doctor Adams will destroy. Right death. You must open my mind. Let me warn you and explain to you. Yes, I begin to feel it. We are Simon Van Gelder. He can reshape any mind he chooses. He used it to erase our memories, put his own thoughts there. He was surprised it took so much power. We fought him, remember? But we grew so tired, our minds so blank, so open, that any thought he placed there became our thoughts. Our minds so empty like a sponge, needing thoughts, begging. Empty. Loneliness. So lonely to be sitting there empty, wanting any word from him. Love. Hate. Live. Die. Such agony to be empty. Lonely. So empty. So empty."

Intelligence different from ours or superior? No, I'm not. The mission of the Enterprise is to seek out and contact alien life. It gives me emotional security. Navigator, set a course ahead. Engage. Mister Bailey, phaser crews were sluggish. You were slow in locking them into your directional beam. Helmsman, engineering decks could have been faster, too. Programme a series of simulated attacks and evasion maneuvers. Keep repeating the exercise until we're proficient, gentlemen. Captain's quarters. Aren't you the one who always says a little suffering is good for the soul? I think he'll cut it. Why, Doctor, you've been reading your textbooks again? What's next? They're not machines, Jim? Doctor McCoy, I've heard you say that man is ultimately superior to any mechanical device. I could've sworn I heard you say that. Kirk here. Let's try for one hundred, Mister Spock.

All engines stop. Phaser crews stand ready. What's its mass, Mister Spock? Reduce image. Let me see all of it. Ship to ship. This is the United Earth ship Enterprise. We convey greetings and await your reply. What is it, Mister Bailey? Pick it up. Ship to ship. This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. The warning nature of your space buoy was unknown to us. Our vessel was blocked. When we attempted to disengage Does the recorder marker have this on its tapes? Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker. Mister Bailey? Captain to crew. Those of you who have served for long on this vessel have encountered alien lifeforms. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, an irrational fear of the unknown. But there's no such thing as the unknown, only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood. In most cases we have found that intelligence capable of a civilisation is capable of understanding peaceful gestures. Surely a lifeform advanced enough for space travel is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives. All decks stand by. Captain out. Ship to ship. This is the Captain of the Enterprise. We came seeking friendship but we have no wish to trespass. To demonstrate our goodwill, our vessel will now return the way it came. We Lay in a course ahead, Mister Bailey. Engage, warp factor one. Switch to impulse. Yes, of course you were. They want us to lose our heads. Bailey, you're relieved! Escort him to his quarters, Doctor. Ship to ship. This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. It is the custom of Earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible. We destroyed your space buoy as a simple act of self-preservation. When we attempted to move away from it, it emitted radiation harmful to our species. If you've examined our ship and its tapes, you know this to be true. What's the matter with them out there? They must know we mean them no harm. There must be something to do, something I've overlooked. Is that your best recommendation? Nobody's given up yet. That's my decision, Doctor. I'm ordering you to drop it. I have no time for you, your theories, your quaint philosophies. Any time you can bluff me, Doctor. All right, Doctor. Let's hope we have time to argue about it. Not chess, Mister Spock, poker. Do you know the game? Ship to ship. This is the Captain of the Enterprise. Our respect for other lifeforms requires that we give you this warning. One critical item of information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of any Earth ship. Since the early years of space exploration, Earth vessels have had incorporated into them a substance known as corbomite. It is a material and a device which prevents attack on us. If any destructive energy touches our vessel, a reverse reaction of equal strength is created, destroying Destroying the attacker! It may interest you to know that since the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago, no attacking vessel has survived the attempt. Death has little meaning to us. If it has none to you then attack us now. We grow annoyed at your foolishness. Doc. Sorry. Permission granted. It does have advantages over chess. Here it comes. Is it raise or call? Hold on that. Let him sweat for a change. Ship to ship. Request denied. It's a small ship. I want a right angled course. Shear away from him no matter which way he turns. Maximum acceleration when I give the word. Engage. More power. Shear away, Mister Bailey. Now, Mister Sulu. Impulse power two. All engines stop. Then we're not home yet. Any reply? Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey. Dead ahead. This is the Captain speaking. First Federation vessel is in distress. We're preparing to board it. There are lives at stake. By our standards, alien life but lives nevertheless. Captain out. Mister Scott, ready the transporter room. Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres. Ahead slow. What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor? To seek out and contact alien life, and an opportunity to demonstrate what our high-sounding words mean. Any questions? I'll take two men with me. Doctor McCoy to examine and treat the aliens if necessary, and you, Mister Bailey. The face of the unknown. I think I owe you a look at it. Denied. If I'm wrong, if it's a trap, I want you here. Transporter ready? Air sample? Thank you, Scotty. Ready, Doctor? Energise. It's a dummy. A puppet of some kind. I'm Captain Kirk. Commander Balok. Commander, that puppet. I see. But you probed our memory banks. Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can find a volunteer, Mister Bailey? But you'd find out more about us that way, and I'd get a better officer in return."

718,TOS,episode 10,BALOK,"And trespassed into our star systems. This is Balok, Commander of the flagship Fesarius of the First Federation. Your vessel, obviously the product of a primitive and savage civilisation, having ignored a warning buoy and having then destroyed it, has demonstrated your intention is not peaceful. We are now considering the disposition of your ship and the life aboard. No further communication will be accepted. If there is the slightest hostile move, your vessel will be destroyed immediately. Your recorder marker has been destroyed. You have been examined. Your ship must be destroyed. We make assumption you have a deity or deities or some such beliefs which comfort you. We therefore grant you ten Earth time periods known as minutes to make preparations. You are wasting time and effort. There is no escape. You have eight Earth minutes left. You now have seven minutes left. Four minutes. Three minutes. You now have two minutes. This is the Commander of the Fesarius. The destruction of your vessel has been delayed. We will relent in your destruction only if we have proof of your corbomite device. We will soon inform you of our decision regarding your vessel. And having permitted your primitive efforts to see my form, I trust it has pleased your curiosity. And now, another demonstration of our superiority. It has been decided that I will conduct you to a planet of the First Federation which is capable of sustaining your lifeform. There you will disembark and be interned. Your ship will be destroyed, of course. Do not be deceived by the size of this pilot vessel. It has an equal potential to destroy your vessel. So that you may sustain your gravity and atmosphere, your systems are now open. Escape is impossible since you are being taken under our power to your destination. Any move to escape or destroy this ship will result in the instant destruction of the Enterprise and everyone aboard. I'm Balok. Welcome aboard. And McCoy and Bailey. Sit. Be comfortable. Go ahead, be seated. We must drink. This is tranya. I hope you relish it as much as I. I know, I know, a thousand questions. But first, the tranya. Gentlemen. Ahh. My alter ego, so to speak. In your culture, he would be Mister Hyde to my Jekyll. You must admit he's effective. You would never have been frightened by me. And I thought my distress signal quite clever. It was a pleasure testing you. I had to discover your real intentions. Your records could have been a deception on your part. I have no crew, Doctor. I run everything, this entire complex, from this small ship. But I miss company, conversation. Even an alien would be welcome. Perhaps one of your men for some period of time. An exchange of information, cultures. Ah. You represent Earth's best, then. I see. We think much alike, Captain, you and I. Now, before I bring back the Fesarius, let me show you my vessel. It is not often I have this pleasure. Yes, we're very much alike, Captain. Both proud of our ships. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios INC. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now you're tired and you To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave? And do what? Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day. You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves? Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away. Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers.

Continue to the Vega Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the helm. Maintain present course. Drop by my cabin, Doctor. What's that? I didn't say there's anything wrong with me. That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to log the ship's doctor's opinion, too. Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also. What the devil are you putting in there, ice? What makes you think I need one? Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven injured. Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors. You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil. To the point of considering resigning. Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles of park land around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we used to take some food and ride out all day. I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony. The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole galaxy of things to choose from. Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender. Address intercraft. This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our time warp, factor seven. Engage. Spectography? Gravity? Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it? Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us. There's no indication of problems down there, but let's not take chances. Right. Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise. The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon. Enterprise. We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly. Yes, affirmative on the Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out. I, I don't understand."

735,TOS,episode 11,SPOCK,"Eleven years, four months, five days. Captain Pike, may I remain for a moment? You know why I've come, Captain. It's only six days away at maximum warp and I have it well-planned. I have never disobeyed your orders before, Captain, but this time I must. I know. I know it is treachery and it's mutiny. but I must do this. I have no choice. I have security clearance, Chief. This is Mister Spock. The ship's computers will handle the helm on this voyage, Mister Hansen. Course will be computed and set automatically. You will not discuss this with ship's crew or starbase personnel. Do you read? Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one hour. The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen. Maintain radio silence, Lieutenant. This is First Officer Spock. Per Starfleet orders this date, I have been placed in temporary command of the Enterprise. While our destination is secret, our mission is relatively simple. Starbase Command has assigned Captain Kirk medical rest leave until our return. His instructions are that you will obey my orders as you would his. First Officer out. And no one from the ship made such a call. Doctor, I regret they elected to keep certain things from you. Will you come with me, please. Doctor, one moment, please. Take no action, Mister Hansen. You have your orders, Mister Hansen. We'll make no contact. Lock on to sensors. Measure object now following the Enterprise. Stop. How long before shuttlecraft's fuel supply forces return to starbase? Computer control. Lock on to shuttlecraft following us. Go to tape Abel Seven Baker. Execute instructions. This is the First Officer speaking. Security, send an armed team to the Bridge. Transporter Room, stand by to beam Captain Kirk aboard. Effective until then, Lieutenant Hansen is in operational command. First Officer out. Doctor, as senior officer present, I present myself to you for arrest. The charge is mutiny, Doctor. I never received orders to take command. Doctor. Adequate, Doctor. I'll make no trouble. Sir, I waive counsel. Further, I waive rights to this hearing and request immediate court-martial. May I inquire on what grounds, Captain? Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command rank available. Yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christopher Pike. I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list. I am. Are your comments a part of the record, sir? Thank you. Request monitor screen be engaged. To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain the importance of going to Talos Four. This is thirteen years ago. The Enterprise and its commander, Captain Christopher Pike. Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way. I cannot tell you at this time, sir. Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore. You did ask that question. As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago. We were on routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead. At first we were not certain what it was. Their call letters check with a survey expedition. S. S. Columbia disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago. Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere. We aren't going to go, to be certain? Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos. Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some clever photographic record. Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen years ago? Yes, gentlemen. On that screen as it happened, the incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four. If, after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I will release this ship to manual control. Preliminary lab survey ready, sir. Yes, sir. Spock here. There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read? Are coming from Talos Four, sir. The Commodore must be aware that Captain Kirk knew nothing of this. Sir, I respectfully decline. Captain, Jim, please don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the transmission."

It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here. System open. Course computed and on the screen. We've settled into orbit, sir. Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a spaceship hull. Yes, sir. And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time barrier's been broken. Our new ships can Captain!"
738,TOS,episode 11,ONE,"No. It's something else. There's still something out there. Evasive manoeuvres, sir? We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out. Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years. Yes, sir. All decks have acknowledged, sir. Of course, sir. Landing party, come in. Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send out scouting and scientific parties now? I didn't get that last message, Captain. Landing party, come in."

We can't disengage, Captain. The helm does not respond. It's for Commodore Mendez. Commodore Mendez, urgent.

We've learned to tie into every human organ in the body except one. The brain. The brain is what life is all about. Now, that man can think any thought that we can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out, and no one can reach in. No to what? They could question him for days, weeks, before they stumble on the right thing. I don't read you at all, Jim. Jim, forgetting how well we both know Spock, the simple fact that he's a Vulcan means he's incapable of telling a lie. And that half is completely submerged. To be caught acting like us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him. He would not make a false entry. I can't, but to question Spock of all people? Me, yes. I could run off half-cocked given a good reason. So could you, but not Spock. It's impossible. McCoy here. Well, what is it? Sickness? Injury? How bad is it? Probably somebody discovered a hangnail. I'll beam up and let you know, Jim. What's going on around here? Who said Jim needed a medical rest leave? And this call about me being needed aboard the ship. I've checked everywhere. That's right. What is this, Spock? Captain, are you all right? I see that you're still signaling I keep wondering who might be after us in a shuttlecraft and I keep coming up with the same answers, but I can't be right, can l, Mister Spock. Is it the captain, Mister Spock? You what? Mister Spock is, er, under arrest. Is confinement to quarters enough? Well, confine him."

749,TOS,episode 11,KIRK,"We received a subspace message asking us to divert here immediately. Mister Spock received a starbase transmission, a message from the former commander of the Enterprise, Fleet Captain Pike, urgently requesting that we divert here. If my first officer states he received a transmission from Why? When he was promoted to Fleet Captain. I took over the Enterprise from him. Spock served with him for several years. Chris, if there's anything I can do for you. Once more, Jose. Spock stated he received a message for us to come here. He entered same in his log. That's all the proof I require. Then I suggest the record tapes have been deliberately changed. A computer expert can change record tapes, duplicate voices, say anything, say nothing. If he had wanted to see Captain Pike he could have requested a leave. I would have granted it. Who would want to divert us here? There's no trouble in the space sector we're patrolling now. No alien problems. Helen described Miss Piper, a Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist without breathing. That goes for his present commander as well as his past. There's no way he could even have asked for that message to be sent? This is Captain Kirk. You have confirmation, Miss Uhura. Mister Spock is with me here. He'll answer all questions. Kirk out. He keeps blinking no. No to what? How long will he live? He keeps blinking no. Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock? What I mean is either a message was received. It was one of two things. Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone on board the ship lied about receiving it. Could that someone be Mister Spock? He's also half human. Someone's interfering with my command and my ship. I don't know who it is, but I mean to find out. Even you. If I thought you had the technical know-how I'd suspect you, but you don't. Spock does. There's a false entry in the log right now which doesn't jibe with the established facts. How do you explain that. For eyes of Starfleet Command only. What every ship Captain knows. General Order 7, no vessel under any condition, emergency or otherwise, is to visit Talos Four. The Enterprise, commanded by Captain Christopher Pike. Kirk to Doctor McCoy. I'm recording you this message, Bones, so there will be no misunderstanding. I'm sorry to have to make it an order. You're not to disturb Captain Pike with any questions. Simply take good care of him. Follow Spock's instructions to the letter. Kirk out. Spock is headed for Talos Four, all right. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in! Blast you any way. You had no right to come along. Two hours of oxygen left. Part of me is hoping the Enterprise won't come back for us. We step on that deck, Spock is finished. Court-martialed, disgraced. Spock would have some logical reason for going there. Store our shuttlecraft on the hangar deck, Mister Scott. Beam us directly aboard. Accepting command. Where's Mister Spock? Reverse power. Hold this position. Tell whoever gave those orders to report Disengage computer control, Uhura. Computer control, come in. Disengage from helm. This is the Captain. On voice command, you will override all contrary instructions. Voice command, disengage from helm. This hearing is convened. Mister Spock, you're aware of your right to counsel of your choice? Request denied. A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command officers. Since there are only two of that rank available Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid. By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish to present. Apparently what he had in mind. Screen off. Chris, was that really you on the screen? That's impossible. Mister Spock, no vessel makes record tapes in that detail, that perfect. What were we watching? I am forced to contest that, Commodore. I want to see more. That has nothing to do with it. Screen on, Mister Scott. We still haven't heard the full story. I vote to continue. Not a deadlock. There's still one member of the trial board to be heard from. Yes. Captain's log supplemental. Mister Spock, on trial for mutiny, has forced the court to accept unusual evidence. On our monitor screen, the voyage of Captain Pike and the Enterprise to the one forbidden world in all the galaxy. What is it? Plead signal for you, sir. Go ahead, Uhura. Receiving transmissions from Talos Four? Then the images we've been seeing are Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind? Lock him up.

I recognized the Captain immediately. A mutual friend described you, sir. Lieutenant Helen Johansson. She merely mentioned she knew you, sir. Oh, yes, sir. I'm afraid our investigation turned up very little, Commodore. There is, of course, Mister Spock's years of service with Captain Pike. Indications of his extreme loyalty to this former commander. We're forced to consider every possibility, sir. We can be certain Captain Pike cannot have sent a message. In his condition he's under observation every minute of every day. With the flashing light, he can say yes or no. Commodore! Captain Pike, he's gone!"

You actually don't know what's happened to Captain Pike? There's been subspace chatter about it for months. I'm sorry to have to be the one to show you. He's upstairs in the medical section. You ever met Chris Pike? About your age. Big, handsome man, vital, active. Inspection tour of a cadet vessel. Old Class J starship. One of the baffle plates ruptured. He went in bringing out all those kids that were still alive. Just wanted you gentlemen to be prepared. Captain Pike. Captain, you remember these gentlemen. They wanted to visit you. Two flashes mean no. I thought you might make an exception for them. I'm sorry, gentlemen. And what do those record tapes show? No message sent from here. No message received by your vessel. The fact remains that your first officer's former captain is hospitalised, horribly injured, at this base, and that same first officer seems to be the only one who heard that message. Well, that's true of course. Computer Centre. Have you rechecked all the record tapes on the date in question? Is there any way at all a message could have been sent from here without us knowing it? All right. Start checking the impossible. Mendez out. Oh, have I introduced Miss Piper, Jim? This is Captain Kirk, Miss Piper. You have something to report, Miss Piper? And totally unable to move, Jim. His wheel chair is constructed to respond to his brain waves. Oh, he can turn it, move it forwards, or backwards slightly. But that's it, Jim. That's as much as that poor devil can do. His mind is as active as yours and mine, but it's trapped inside a useless vegetating body. He's kept alive mechanically, a battery-driven heart. Oh, I'm certifying I ordered you to read it. Know anything at all about this planet? And to do so is the only death penalty left on our books. Only Fleet Command knows why. Not even this file explains that. But it does name the only Earth ship that ever visited the planet. With a half Vulcan science officer named Spock. Mendez here. What is it? Starbase Shuttlecraft one to Enterprise. Come in, please. Enterprise, Commodore Mendez and Captain Kirk. If you read me, you are ordered to reply. Repeating it on all emergency frequencies, Jim. Pulling ahead of us fast. Fuel is down to sixty three point three. If we turn back now, we've just got barely enough to get us back to the base. We coast. RHIP, Captain. Rank hath its privileges. Wonderful. He's dead if he makes it to Talos Four. Why would he want to get Pike there? The command reports stated Talos contained absolutely no practical benefits to mankind. Maybe. Maybe he's just gone mad. His quarters, after what he's done, Lieutenant? We didn't have the heart to retire him, Jim. He's got you. Whatever he's up to, he's planned it well. Captain's log, stardate 3012.6. General Court-Martial convened. Mister Spock has again waived counsel and has entered a plea of guilty. Mister Spock, are you aware in pleading guilty that a further charge involving the death penalty must be held against you should this vessel enter the Talos star group? Why? What does it accomplish to go there or to take Captain Pike there? I want to know why. Yes, it's on the record. For what purpose? Present your evidence. Screen on. Captain Pike, were any record tapes of this nature made during your voyage? The court is not obliged to view evidence without knowing its source. You mean I was maneuvered into asking. Your evidence is out of order. You have that right, Captain, but just because the prisoner is your First Officer and your personal friend Very well, continue. Screen off. Mister Spock, I'm truly amazed at your technical prowess in somehow manufacturing all this. I congratulate you on your imagination. But this is a court of space law, not a theatre. You're in no position to bargain. This is ridiculous. This man mutinied, stole your ship, abducted Captain Pike. Well, for me this has gone far enough. And I vote we do not. Deadlock, and since I'm Very well. Captain Pike, it's up to you. Do we continue under these conditions? Screen on. Mister Spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact with Talos Four. You have deliberately invited the death penalty. You've not only finished yourself, Spock, but you've finished your Captain as well. And you're aware a Captain is responsible for everything that occurs on his ship. I order you to return this vessel back to manual control. Very well. You've earned the consequences. This court is in recess."

I can become anything, any woman you, you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole universe. Let me please you. You're a fool. Perhaps if you asked me some questions I could answer. If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let me live it with you? They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do. And, er, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll find out about that. War, thousands of centuries ago. But they found it's a trap, like a narcotic, because when dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record. You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy. Please. You said that if I answered questions I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We are like Adam and Eve. If we. No, please, no! Don't punish me! I'll die! You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my saddle. Is it good to be home? My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? You're home. You can even stay if you want. No. PIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now, you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't repair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us, to build a colony of slaves? Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us? Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions, but you can't keep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I know you must hate me for that. But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way. No! Let me finish! It's not fair. You don't need them. How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How can that help? He doesn't need you. He's already picked me. Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring. You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with a computer. It's not fair. I did what you asked. Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil. He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship. What is that? If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go, either. I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again. He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the ship. I can't. I can't go with you. You see why I can't go with you. They found me in the wreckage, dying, a lump of flesh. They rebuilt me. Everything works, but they had never seen a human. They had no guide for putting me back together."

They had us seeing just what we wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery, everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp, the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds, they can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore. Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room.

You will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions. You now see the primitive fear/threat reaction. The specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel, and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess, the creature will throw himself against the transparency. Despite its frustration, the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the experiment.

Can you understand me? You're not speaking, yet I hear you. All right, then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an unfriendly act If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it. This is Rigel Seven. I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be there. They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere I've been. It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago, except for you. Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the survivors call Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you again? Why didn't they create a different girl? But it's only a dream. You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an animal performing for its supper. Why are you here? Are you real? No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before, never even imagined you. What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear? So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how I react, is that it? Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too? Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way? Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this conversation, is there? How far can they control my mind? Perhaps. But they try to trick me with their illusions. Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go underground? That's why it's so barren up there? VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again. So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and they concentrated on developing their mental power. Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me. Which means they had to have more than one of each animal. They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to get the Earth woman? But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said you weren't real, remember? Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals? And if I prefer Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you? That's very interesting. You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then? No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck. Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through? All right, all right. Let's talk about the girl. You seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel protective. KEEPER; This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species. Seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and like her. Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human community. You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not cooperating! Why don't you punish me? Tango! You old devil, you. Uh, I'm sorry I don't have any sugar. Well, they think of everything, don't they? They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want if I co-operate, is that it? But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage! Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our keeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate in your mind, does that block off our mind from them? Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like. If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. I was from the very first moment I saw you in the survivor's camp. You were like a wild little animal. VINA; I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for you. You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you, either. A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a ship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and proper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that. Vina? They don't work. Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black out everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate. I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood red like ours? I'm going to find out. All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these thoughts, images of hate, killing? You'll find my thoughts more interesting, thoughts so primitive you can't understand. Emotions so No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read through hate. Hold still, or I'll break your neck. I've had some samples of how good they are. You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. All right, now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and I'll break your neck. I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason at all. On the other hand, I've got a reason. I'm willing to bet you've created an illusion this laser is empty. I think it just blasted a hole in that window and you're keep us from seeing it. You want me to test my theory out on your head? Make contact, Number One. I want to contact our ship. And start by burying you? Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives of these two Earth women. You give me proof that our ship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina. The weapon is building up an overload, a force chamber explosion. You still have time to get underground. Well, go on! Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her. Wait. And that's it. No apologies. You captured one of us, threatened all of us. But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual cooperation. Let's get back to the ship. You'll give her back her illusion of beauty? No. No, and I agreed with her reasons. Engage."

Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life. Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.

A brilliant deduction by Captain Pike, gentlemen. Yes, he was still inside his cell, but knowing that couldn't help him. And could make him live any place, any time, any situation they wished. He would see, taste, suffer with the same reality as you gentlemen sitting there. Because they know that Captain Pike is fatigued. We can reconvene later. They want him back alive, sir.

Talos controls the vessel now, sir, as they did thirteen years ago. You've asked me why. You'll see the answer now. Mister Spock here. All decks prepare for hyperdrive.

The only answer Spock would give was on the hearing-room screen. How Spock could do this he refused to explain, but there before our eyes, actual images from thirteen years ago of Captain Pike as he was when he commanded this vessel, of Spock in those days, and of how the Enterprise had become the first and only starship to visit Talos Four. They had received a distress signal from that planet and discovered there, still alive after many years, the survivors of a missing vessel, only to find it was all an illusion. No survivors, no encampment, it was all a trap set by a race of beings who could make a man believe he was seeing anything they wished him to see, and Captain Pike was gone, a prisoner for some unknown purpose. And the images we've been seeing are Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind? The court-martial of Mister Spock has been convened in closed session. Despite all we can do, images continue to be transmitted to us from Talos Four. The Talosians controlled his brain. Then they care about the Captain. Why? Just to maintain a supply of zoo specimens? That's Vina again, as the green Orion slave girl? Strange evidence from the past, how the Talosians, planning to breed a society of human slaves, tempted Captain Pike with the Earth woman they held in captivity. And as she appeared to him in many forms, each more exciting than the last, Pike was beginning to weaken. Well, Mister Spock? You keep talking about life, Mister Spock. A chance for life. How? As a prisoner, caged, a zoo specimen, living the illusions that amuse his keepers? Guilty as charged. Commodore, don't you think that Mister Spock, even if regulations are explicit, you could have come to me and explained. Yes. Chris, do you want to go there? Mister Spock, would you care to take Captain Pike to the transporter room, see him off? Er, Mister Spock, when you're finished, please come back and see me. I want to talk to you. This regret table tendency you've been showing lately towards flagrant emotionalism"

Take cover. Increase to full power! Can you give us any more? Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second. Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down inside the Talosian community. Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out. Captain! Captain. But we were a party of six. They were fully charged when we left. It's dead. I can't make a signal. What is it? Offspring as in, he's Adam. Is that it? Well, shall we do some time computation? There was a Vina listed on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen years to your age then. Captain. They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and never knew it. Captain. It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves. Captain, we have transporter control now. Isn't she coming with us? All decks are ready, sir."
937,TOS,episode 12,MENDEZ,"How do you plead to the charge of unlawfully taking command? Of sabotaging the computers of this vessel and locking it on a course for planet Talos Four? And of forcibly attempting to transport Captain Pike to that planet? Mister Spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact with Talos Four. You have deliberately invited the death penalty. Starfleet has ordered no contact with Talos Four. They made no exceptions. What is it? Why have they stopped the images? I demand to know why. You're forgetting you're on trial, Spock. You will answer all questions put to you. An Earth woman? Then you were captured as breeding stock. They're like animals, vicious, seductive. They say no human male can resist them. It seems the Talosians have deserted you. May I have your verdict? Guilty, yes or no, Captain? Yes. I must also vote guilty as charged. And you, Captain? Mendez here."

You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment. From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now consume the nourishment. If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are things even more unpleasant. Now to the female. As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet, but with only a single survivor. We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species interesting. It became necessary to attract a mate. We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life. With the female now properly conditioned. First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy. Excellent. Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a selection. Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour. The female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce highly intelligent children. The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but now is realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth and strength, plus unusually strong female drives. Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as quickly rewarded. You will find it an effective combination. Your ship. Release me, or we'll destroy it. As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing. You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With the female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives. That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's surface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life. Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves? We had not believed this possible. The customs and history of your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant and benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and dangerous a species for our needs. No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our last hope. Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself, too. This is the female's true appearance. It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an honest one. And more. What you now seem to hear, Captain Kirk, are my thought transmissions. The Commodore was never aboard your vessel. His presence there and in the shuttlecraft was an illusion. Mister Spock had related to us your strength of will. It was thought the fiction of a court-martial would divert you from too soon regaining control of your vessel. Captain Pike is welcome to spend the rest of his life with us, unfettered by his physical body. The decision is yours and his. Captain Pike has an illusion, and you have reality. May you find your way as pleasant. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Ready to resume course, Captain. What kind? Personnel? Cargo? How did you know this lady was coming aboard? May I inquire as to our course, Captain? Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course. We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen hundred Benecia time. Captain. He came up from engineering, Captain. Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to consider this transfer a disciplinary action. Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed. My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol. It occurred. I dismissed it. Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to engineering? No, thank you. Full personal dossiers on the following names. Doctor Thomas Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley, and Captain James T. Kirk. Correlate. Check their past histories. Report any item, any past episode or experience they all have in common. I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law. You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own theories of eugenics. Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy. Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Over four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died. Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos? There never was a positive identification of his body. His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared. He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was one of them. With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was somewhere near when they died. You've got to pull him through. If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the Captain. And he'll be the next target. Captain's log, stardate 2819.1. Ship's officer Riley's condition worsening. Doctor McCoy making lab analysis to determine cause and antidote. Entire crew deeply concerned. Someone tried to poison him. I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to see that report. Now. Can we predict the same for you, Captain? Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you. Someone tried to kill him. You should be told the difference between empiricism and stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you did. I got the same information. Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth operation of this ship. It could happen. Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you invite death? He is. Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley while the company is on board the Enterprise. Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum. On overload. You can't stay. Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear section C4 and C5. I believe we have a match, Captain. Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain."

What are you so worried about, anyway? I find Jim generally knows what he's doing. Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl? You would. Lots of things go on around here that I don't know, Mister Spock. Now, he's the Captain. He can transfer whoever he pleases. You can look that up in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere. All right? Come on, have a drink. You're welcome. But I will. And please, Mister Spock, if you won't join me, don't disapprove of me. At least not until you've tried it, huh? I appreciate whatever concern you may have for the ship's company, Mister Spock, I've heard of it. Unfortunately, he wasn't the first. What has Karidian to do with it? You think Jim suspects he's Kodos? It's unbelievable. I'm not sure I can. As of this date, lab report indicates presence of appreciable amount of tetralubisol, a highly volatile lubricant in use aboard ship. Tetralubisol us a milky substance. Someone could have gotten careless, made a mistake. When I've finished logging it. My report on Lieutenant Riley. He's got a good chance. Could have been an accident. Jim, Spock's simply trying, It's his job, and you know it. Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance? What if you decide he is Kodos? What then? Do you play God, carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won't bring back the dead, Jim. Medical log. Lieutenant Riley's sufficiently recovered to be discharged, but the Captain's ordered him restricted to Sickbay to prevent contact with the passenger who calls himself Karidian and who's suspected of being Kodos the Executioner and of murdering the Lieutenant's family. Captain's log, stardate 2819.8. Suspect under surveillance. Strategic areas under double guard. Performance of the Karidian Players taking place as scheduled.   In the long history of medicine, no doctor has ever caught the first few minutes of a play. Riley, don't forget to Riley? Captain Kirk, McCoy here. Riley's gone. I was recording my log about Karidian and Kodos. If he overheard Medical report. She'll receive the best of care, Jim. She remembers nothing. She even thinks her father's still alive giving performances before cheering crowds. You really cared for her, didn't you? You're not going to answer my question, are you?

You said you discovered a new food concentrate. What am I supposed to put in my log, that you lied? That you diverted a starship with false information? You're not only in trouble, you've put me in trouble, too. Kodos is dead. Tom, the authorities closed the book on that case years ago. Martha, you tell him. Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that. He's dead. And I have to get back to my ship and figure out how I'm going to enter all this in my log. Tom. Martha. History files. Subject, former Governor Kodos of Tarsus Four, also known as Kodos the Executioner. After that, background on actor Anton Karidian. Stop. Information on Anton Karidian. Stop. Give comparative identification between actor Karidian and Governor Kodos. Give information on actor Karidian prior to Kodos' death. Photograph Kodos. Photograph Karidian. Now photograph both. Mister Spock. You know Doctor Leighton, don't you? Would you say he's given to fantasy? With a very long memory. We'll delay departure for a time. I'm beaming back down to the planet. Where's Tom? The others are on the patio. Why not? I saw your performance today. May I extend my appreciation? Captain James Kirk, Starship Enterprise. I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally. An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual. Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth. So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move? She's a good ship. Thank you. You were very impressive as Lady Macbeth. Very impressive. Lenore. I'd like to see you again. Not necessarily. You don't have a schedule now, do you? Exactly. Good. I'll make our apologies to our hostess. I'll meet you outside. KIRK; Tired of walking? About what? It's Tom Leighton. He's dead. I don't know. I'll try and find out. Kirk to Enterprise. Put me through to Captain Jon Daily of the AstraI Queen on orbit station, and put it on scramble. Can you do me a favour? Don't make your pick-up here. I'll pick them up. And if there's any trouble, it'll be my responsibility. Just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks. Over and out. Kirk to Enterprise. Transporter room, ready to beam up. I think we're due for a pick-up. Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant. I'm the Captain. You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you I arranged it. Can't you make other arrangements? It'd be a shame if that happened. Well. The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers. What have you got to trade? You make it sound very interesting. The crew has been on patrol for a long time. They could use a break in the monotony. You've got me backed into a corner. The men would never forgive me if I deprived them of your performance, and your presence. Mister Spock, prepare to leave orbit as soon as the Karidian company is aboard the ship. Benecia Colony. If my memory needs refreshing, Mister Spock, I'll ask you for it. In the meantime, follow my orders. Captain's log, stardate 2818.9. There are many questions in my mind, too many, perhaps, about the actor Karidian and his daughter. For personal reasons, I'm almost afraid to learn the answers. Mister Spock, the Benecia Colony. Data on question submitted to personnel files. Stop. Give list. Stop. Is that star service Lieutenant Kevin Riley? Stop. Mister Spock. Lieutenant Kevin Riley in communications, I wish to have him transferred down to the engineering decks. I'm sending him back. I don't wish to discuss it, Mister Spock. Please follow my orders. It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard. This is the observation deck. That's the flight deck down there with the shuttle craft. Isn't it? Anything. If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music and flowers. Unfortunately, it isn't so. On the Enterprise, we try to duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible. It's very old. Come from a very human source. You can count on it. I'd rather talk about you. You must have wanted to perform since you first saw your father act. When was that? Tell me about it. What would you like to know? Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always remains a woman. Come. Will he make it? All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it. All right. Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock? My personal business, You think that happened? I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs. Not even my second in command. I know what he's doing, and I don't like it. And you also know that nothing is proven. I'm not. I'm interested in justice. No, I'm not sure. I wish I was. I've done things I've never done before. I've placed my command in jeopardy. From here on I've got to determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos. You sound certain. I wish I could be. Before I accuse a man of that, I've got to be. I saw him once, twenty years ago. Men change. Memory changes. Look at him now, he's an actor. He can change his appearance. No. Logic is not enough. I've got to feel my way, make absolutely sure. No, but they may rest easier. Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt. Besides, I have an idea may prove A phaser. This is the Captain. There's a phaser on overload in my quarters. If it blows, it'll take out the entire deck. Evacuate all personnel in this quadrant. Double Red Alert. You get out of here. Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it. We're overdue for our talk, aren't we? A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have destroyed several decks of this ship. Before that, someone tried to poison one of my crewmen. I'm sure you are. Are you Kodos? I asked you a question. I do. You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago? So was I. But I remember. Let's see if you do. Read this into that communicator on the wall. It will be recorded and compared to a piece of Kodos' voice film we have in our files. The test is virtually infallible. It will tell us whether you're Karidian, or Kodos the Executioner. Ready for voice test. Disguising your voice will make no difference. I remember the words. I wrote them down. You said them like you knew them. You hardly glanced at the paper. Are you sure? Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front of a captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy? We've armed man with tools. The striving for greatness continues. But Kodos Or is. All I understand is that four thousand people were needlessly butchered. But he didn't. And history has made its judgment. Those beautiful words, well acted, change nothing. There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to twenty years ago. If I had gotten everything I wanted, you might not walk out of this room alive. In the beginning perhaps. But later, I wanted it to be more than that. If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves. And if he isn't, then we'll let you off at Benecia, and no harm done. Who do I have to be? But not an exact match, Mister Spock. We're dealing with a man's life. No machine can make that decision. Yes, Doctor. You've made your point, Doctor. This is the Captain. Security two alert. Find and restrain Lieutenant Kevin Riley. He's armed and possibly headed towards the ship's theatre. Riley, get back to the Sickbay. You could be wrong. Don't throw away your life on a mistake. It's an order. Give me the weapon. Now get back to Sickbay. Go on. Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you. The play is over. It's been over for twenty years. By killing seven innocent men. Guard. You'll never get off the ship. Stand by, Mister Leslie. All channels cleared, Uhura? Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie. Ahead warp factor one, Mister Leslie."

I'm sorry, Captain Kirk. He has a rigid rule about that. He never sees anyone personally, and he never attends parties. Karidian is a most unusual man. You saw Macbeth. That was my father. So. Captain of the Enterprise. Interesting. We play two performances at Benecia, if the AstraI Queen can get us there. Thank you. And as Lenore Karidian? You mean professionally? I think I'd like that. Unfortunately, we must keep a schedule. You mean leave? But I've only just arrived. KIRK; So have I. And you hate to overstay a welcome. Why not? No. Just thinking. At the party, you were such a brash young man. KIRK; And now? Now somehow different. Not a ship's Captain with all those people to be strong and confident in front of. You know, you're really very dear, aren't you? In some ways, very lonely. Captain Kirk, I didn't think we'd be meeting again so soon. No, but it's a delightful thought. Captain, I'm afraid we need your help. We've been stranded. It seems that our transportation has cancelled out on us. Yes, but not in time. You see, our schedule is like a chain. One break and it all collapses. If ever we needed a Good Samaritan. I appeal to you. I'll make a bargain with you, Captain. Special performance for the crew in exchange for a lift. Then you'll do it? Thank you, Captain. I'm eternally grateful. I'll get the company ready. This means so much to them. Interesting. Tell me, Captain Kirk. Did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion? Star light, star bright. I wish I may, I wish I might. Do you remember that, Captain? Almost as old as the stars themselves. And this ship. All this power, surging and throbbing, yet under control. Are you like that, Captain? All this power at your command, yet the decisions that you have to make Are you, Captain? Human? Tell me about the women in your world, Captain. In the beginning. That's not fair. You haven't answered my question about the women. Has the machine changed them? Made them just people instead of women? All this and power too. The Caesar of the stars and the Cleopatra to worship him. Captain Kirk. You'd better rest now. There's a stain of cruelty on your shining armour, Captain. You could have spared him, and me. You talked of using tools. I was a tool, wasn't l? A tool to use against my father. Later. Everything's always later. Later. Latest. Too late. Too late, Captain. You are like your ship, powerful, and not human. There is no mercy in you. Captain Kirk. Who are you to say what harm was done? Tonight, the Karidian Players present Hamlet, another in a series of living plays presented in space, dedicated to the tradition of classic theatre. Hamlet is a violent play about violent times when life was cheap and ambition was God. It's going beautifully. What is it? What's wrong? No, Father. The time will never come. Tonight, after my performance, the last two who can harm you will be gone. There were nine. Now there are only two, and they will be gone as soon as I. Don't look at me like that. What had to be done. They had to be silenced. No Father, not anymore. I'm strong, Father. It's nothing. We'll be ready. Don't you see? All the ghosts are dead. I've buried them. There's no more blood on your hands. But you're safe now, Father. I've saved you. Now, no one can touch you. Not even Captain Kirk. See Caesar come? He's awed by your greatness, your shining brightness. Bright as a blade before it is stained with blood. Of course. After the play. Stop it, Father! You have nothing to justify. I did it for you. I've saved you. They weren't innocent! They were dangerous! I would have killed a world to save him! The play, Captain. He must go on. This is the great Karidian. You cannot deny him his last performance! It will become a floating tomb, drifting through space with the soul of the great Karidian giving performances at every star he touches. I know how to use this, Captain. Caesar, beware the ides of March. Father. Father! O, proud, death! What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, that thou, such a prince at a shot so bloodily hast struck? The curtain, the curtain rises. It rises. There's no time to sleep. The play. The play. The play's the thing, wherein we'll catch the conscience of the king."

Starship Enterprise diverted from scheduled course. Purpose, to confirm discover by Doctor Thomas Leighton of an extraordinary new synthetic food which would totally end the threat of famine on Cygnia Minor, a nearby Earth colony. I hoped you would have respected my privacy, Captain. I am sorry to hear that. Do you believe that I am? Then I am Kodos, if it pleases you to believe so. I am an actor. I play many parts. Younger, Captain. Much younger. The revolution is successful, but survival depends on drastic measures. Your continued existence represents a threat to the well-being of society. Your lives means slow death to the more valued members of the colony. Therefore I have no alternative but to sentence you to death. Your execution is so ordered. Signed, Kodos, governor of Tarsus Four. I learn my parts very quickly. I find your use of the word mercy strangely inappropriate, Captain. Here you stand, the perfect symbol of our technical society. Mechanised, electronicised, and not very human. You've done away with humanity, the striving of man to achieve greatness through his own resources. Kodos, whoever he was Or is. Kodos made a decision of life and death. Some had to die that others might live. You're a man of decision, Captain. You ought to understand that. In order to save four thousand others. And if the supply ships hadn't come earlier than expected, this Kodos of yours might have gone down in history as a great hero. If you're so sure that I'm Kodos, why not kill me now? Let bloody vengeance take its final course! And see what difference it makes to this universe of yours. I suppose not. They're merely tools, like this ship of yours. Blood thins. The body fails. One is finally grateful for a failing memory. I no longer treasure life, not even my own. I am tired! And the past is a blank. Did you get everything you, wanted, Captain Kirk? I will. My hour is almost come, when I to sulphurous and tormenting fires must render up myself. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. I am thy father's spirit, doomed for a certain term to walk the night, But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house, Thy soul, freeze thy young blood. There was a voice out of the past haunting me, torturing me. There was another part I once played long ago. I never told you about it. Now that same curtain rises again. The time has come. What are you saying? What have you done? All of them? All seven? More blood on my hands? Oh, my child, my child. You've left me nothing! You were the one thing in my life untouched by what I'd done. I was a soldier in a cause. There were things to be done, terrible things. Murder, flight, suicide, madness. I never wanted the blood on my hands ever to stain you. Lenore, don't! No. No, child! Don't!"
1062,TOS,episode 13,DAILY,"Hi, Jim. I owe you a dozen. Just ask. You mean strand all those actors? Will do. Anything else?"
1063,TOS,episode 13,LEIGHTON,"Watch him. Watch Macbeth. That voice. He's back. That man on the stage. I'm certain of it. That's Kodos the Executioner. He is Kodos. I'm sure of it. I did it to trap Kodos! Is he? Is anyone sure? A body burned beyond recognition? Then let's reopen it. Jim, four thousand people were butchered. Well, I'm not. I remember him. That voice. The bloody thing he did. Jim, Jim, I need your help. There were only eight or nine of us who actually saw Kodos. I was one, you were another. If he's to be exposed, Then it will be a ghost Martha and I receive in our home tonight. I invited the entire company to a cocktail party. I have to be sure."

1079,TOS,episode 14,SPOCK,"Still no answer from Earth Outpost number two, Captain, and now number three's gone silent. Earth Outpost four reports they're under attack. A space vessel, identity unknown. Verified, Captain. Referring to the map on your screens, you will note beyond the moving position of our vessel, a line of Earth outpost stations. Constructed on asteroids, they monitor the Neutral Zone established by treaty after the Earth-Romulan conflict a century ago. As you may recall from your histories, this conflict was fought, By our standards today, with primitive atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels Which allowed no quarter, no captives. Nor was there even ship-to-ship visual communication. Therefore, no human, Romulan, or ally has ever seen the other. Earth believes the Romulans to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they think of Earth. The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side, would constitute an act of war. The treaty has been unbroken since that time. Captain. Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain. Sweeping the area of Outpost two. Sensor reading indefinite. Double-checking Outpost three. I read dust and debris. Both Earth outposts gone, and the asteroids they were constructed on, pulverised. And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there. Outpost four disintegrated, Captain. Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a moment. I have a blip on the motion sensor. Could be the intruder. Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain, with selective bending of light. But the power cost is enormous. They may have solved that problem. Blip has changed its heading. And in a very leisurely manoeuvre. They may not be aware of us. His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen. The exact heading a Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home. I have a fix on it, Captain. I believe I can lock on it, get a picture of their Bridge. Very well. Steady on one eleven mark fourteen. Back on their original course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone. From the outpost's protective shield. Cast rodinium. This is the hardest substance known to our science. Lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion. Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a practical invisibility screen. Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor. I agree. Attack. Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack becomes even more imperative. It is for them, Doctor. Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive colonising period. Savage, even by Earth standards. And if Romulans retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not show. Do you want a galactic war on your conscience? A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing course toward it. Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour particles. It leaves a visible trail. Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail. He's maintaining that bearing, Captain. We're losing sensor contact, Captain. It'll take time to correct, sir. Impossible, Captain. Phasers operational, Captain. Intruder bearing one eleven mark fourteen. He may think we're destroyed, Captain. Intruder holding steady. Course one eleven mark fourteen. They did, Doctor. We're still on our side, Captain. Motion sensor signal stopped. Vessel wreckage. Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform and a body, Captain. However. Insufficient mass, sir. Simple debris. Not a vessel, a trick. Nothing, sir. No motion out there at all. We've lost them, Captain. Captain's log, Stardate 1709.6. We are at the Neutral Zone. Have lost contact with the intruder. No reaction on our motion sensors but believe the Romulan vessel to be somewhere close by. With all engines and systems shut down, the Enterprise is also playing the silent waiting game in hope of regaining contact. Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil. It's giving out again. Debris on our scanners. Same type as before, sir, except, one metal-cased object! Nuclear device of some kind, sir. Our phasers detonated it less than one hundred metres away. Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts. We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and make repairs. Damage reports, Mister Stiles? Will you require assistance here? Yes, very well, thank you, Captain. I saved a trained navigator so he could return to duty. I am capable of no other feelings in such matters."

Millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel does. Based on what? Memories of a war over a century ago? On theories about a people we've never even met face to face? War is never imperative, Mister Spock. Amen to that. We're taking a big gamble, Jim. Do we violate the treaty, Captain? Once inside, they can claim we did. A set-up. They want war, we furnish the provocation. Captain, I But I've got one. Something I seldom say to a customer, Jim. In this galaxy, there's a mathematical probability of three million Earth-type planets. And in all of the universe, three million million galaxies like this. And in all of that, and perhaps more, only one of each of us. Don't destroy the one named Kirk. McCoy here. Twenty two so far. Mainly radiation burns, mostly from the ship's outer areas.

That of uniting two people in the bonds of matrimony. We are gathered here today with you, Angela Martine, and you, Robert Tomlinson, in the sight of your fellows, in accordance with our laws and our many beliefs so that you may pledge your Kirk here. Full ahead. All decks, condition red. Scotty. Did Outpost 4 give anything at all on the attacking vessel, Lieutenant? Mister Spock, put this star sector on our screen. Now show our position. Signal this to all decks, Lieutenant. This is the Captain speaking. In our next action, we can risk neither miscalculation nor error By any man aboard. Listen carefully. Science Officer. What you do not know and must be told is that my command orders on this subject are precise and inviolable. No act, no provocation Will be considered sufficient reason to violate the zone. We may defend ourselves, But if necessary to avoid interspace war, Both these outposts and this vessel will be considered expendable. Captain out. After a whole century, what will a Romulan ship look like, Mister Stiles? I doubt they'll radio and identify themselves. I had no idea that history was your specialty. Their war, Mister Stiles. Not yours. Don't forget it. Outpost 2 was the first to go silent, Lieutenant? Open a channel to our nearest command base. Quarter hour reports on our position and status. Call battle stations, Mister Sulu. Energise main phasers, Mister Styles. All weapons to full power. Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status? Confirm what hit you, Hansen. What vessel? Identity? Can you locate the intruder for us? Tie us in. Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen. What do you have on the intruder? Lock us onto your screen. Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range. Make a challenge. Warn that ship off. Position of the intruder, Mister Spock. When they opened fire. Perhaps necessary when they use their weapon. Go to full magnification. I don't see anything. I can't understand it. Discontinue. Contact remaining outposts. Have them signal us any sightings or sensor readings in their area. Their invisibility screen may work both ways. With that kind of power consumption, they may not be able to see us. Parallel course. Negative. You and Mister Sulu will match its course and speed with the object on our sensors exactly, move for move. If he has sensors, I want him to think we're a reflection, an echo. Under no circumstances are you to cross into the Neutral Zone without my direct orders. Cancel battle stations. All decks, standby alert. Mister Stiles. Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders? Very well. All decks, security alert. Pipe it in. Put it on the screen. Decoding? I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles. Repeat it. I assume you're complimenting Mister Spock on his ability to decode. Well, here's one thing you can be sure of, Mister. Leave any bigotry in your quarters. There's no room for it on the Bridge. Do I make myself clear? Stay with him, helm. What's our position, navigator? Bring it to the briefing room. Are you ready, gentlemen? Comments? Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains. Can we engage them with a reasonable possibility of victory? Meaning we can outrun them? Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions. Explain. Sit down, Mister. Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight? Captain to Bridge. What's our position? Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports? And at this distance? Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock. Comet Icarus four. Composition? And when an object passes through it, even an invisible object? Our chance, gentlemen. Prepare to attack. All hands, battle stations. I hope we won't need your services, Bones. Battle status? Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles. The moment he begins entering the comet's tail, he becomes visible. End run, gentlemen. We'll swing around the other side and catch him at that moment. Let's get him, Mister Sulu. Steady as she goes. Phaser crews ready? He'll only be visible for a moment. Stand by. At the last moment he must have guessed our move. Hard to starboard, helm! He did exactly what I would have done. I won't underestimate him again. Now, fire blind. Lay down a pattern. Full astern! Emergency warp speed! Do we have emergency warp? Navigation? Phasers, Mister Spock? Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately. Yeoman. Affirmative. Continue log entries. Limited range. Back to his old course. I wouldn't make that assumption. I don't think their Captain will either. Same as before, Mister Sulu. Stay with him. Let's get them while we are. Before we enter the Neutral Zone. Full ahead, Mister Sulu. Maximum warp. Phasers, stand by. We know their Achilles heel, Mister Stiles. Their weapon takes all their energy. They must become visible in order to launch it. I'm aware of that, Mister Stiles. Are phasers ready? Lieutenant Uhura, inform Command base, In my opinion, no option. On my responsibility, we are proceeding into the Neutral Zone. Steady as we go, Mister Sulu. Continue firing. Cease fire. However? What? Go to sensor probes. All right, Mister Spock, work quietly. Thank you, Yeoman. Bring it to the Bridge. I'll be there in a moment. I wish I were on a long sea voyage somewhere. Not too much deck tennis, no frantic dancing, and no responsibility. Why me? I look around that Bridge, and I see the men waiting for me to make the next move. And Bones, what if I'm wrong? No, I don't really expect an answer. It's all right. It's all right. Power on. Reverse course. He'll try to slip under us. Phasers, fire. Cease fire. Analysis, quickly. Helm, hard over. Phasers, fire point-blank. Captain to Sickbay. Casualties? Thank you, Doctor. Report, Mister Spock? Ship damage? Weapons status? Fully operable, Scotty? Go. Lieutenant Uhura, take over navigation. Maybe we can pull them back to our side of the Neutral Zone. Hold our position. Play dead. Forward phasers, stand by. Fire! Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Stiles! Mister Sulu, prepare to move in on the Romulan vessel. Ship-to-ship, Uhura. Put this on the screen. Captain. Standing by to beam your survivors aboard our ship. Prepare to abandon your vessel. What purpose will it serve to die? Are you all right, Mister Spock? And you, Stiles? How many men did we lose, Bones? It never makes any sense. We both have to know that there was a reason."

Switching to visual. Enterprise, can you see it? My command post here. We're a mile deep on an asteroid. Almost solid iron. And even through our deflectors, it did this. Can you see? No identification. No answer to our challenge. Only a glimpse of it. Then they fired something at us, some form of high-energy plasma. Fantastic power. And then the whole vessel disappeared. But it's out there somewhere. Our sensors show that much. Enterprise, something coming on our viewing screen, coming at us fast. Switching. Can you see it, Enterprise? Can you see it?

It is good we approach the Neutral Zone. Not too soon for me to see the stars of home. I know they are following. First study the enemy, seek weakness. If I were their commander, that is what I would do. A message was dispatched. You've broken the rule of silence. Your carelessness might have ended this glorious mission. You're reduced two steps in rank. Return to post. Danger and I are old companions. I think you do. No need to tell you what happens when we reach home with proof of the Earthmen's weakness. And we will have proof. The Earth commander will follow. He must. When he attacks, we will destroy him. Our gift to the homeland, another war. Must it always be so? How many comrades have we lost in this way? Obedience. Duty. Death and more death. Soon even enough for the Praetor's taste. Centurion, I find myself wishing for destruction before we can return. Worry not. Like you, I am too well-trained in my duty to permit it. Continue evasive manoeuvres. Now, back to the first course. How pleasing to the eye it is. Behold a marvel in the darkness. Its many particles will obscure their sensing device, Centurion. Once fully obscured, we will turn suddenly back upon our adversary. Clear? Escape manoeuvre one, quickly! Divert all power to weapons. Activate our cloak. Quickly! Its commander is not one to repeat a mistake. Evasive action. The Earth ship again. No need. The Centurion is dead. No. No, he's shrewd, this starship commander. He tries to make us waste energy. He has estimated we have only enough. It is time. All debris into disposal tubes. The body of the Centurion, too. Forgive me, my old friend, but I must use all my experience now to get home. Shh. He is there, somewhere. I feel it. Captain's log, supplemental. Now motionless for nine hours, forty seven minutes. We have him. Move toward him. He's a sorcerer, that one. He reads the thoughts in my brain. Our fuel supply all but gone and he stays out of reach. Perhaps we can yet save your Praetor's pride for him. More debris into the tubes. Decius, do we have the old-style nuclear warheads aboard? Place one with the debris. Proximity fuse. Now we go home. We've damaged ourselves. Our fuel reserve is gone. I do not trust their Captain. We will attack, but on my order. No. No, that is not our way. I regret that we meet in this way. You and I are of a kind. In a different reality, I could have called you friend. We are creatures of duty, Captain. I have lived my life by it. Just one more duty to perform."
1190,TOS,episode 14,ROMULAN,"It consumes much power, Commander. With no enemy to concern us. Which neither retreats nor grows nearer. It turns as we turn. Commander, it is our judgment we run from a reflection. Cloaking system on, sir. We enter it, Commander. At last the screen is clear, Commander. Our reflection no longer follows us. Commander, the reflection returns. Commander, our fuel runs low. It moves as we move. Commander! A signal, Commander."
1191,TOS,episode 14,STILES,"Position, eight minutes from Outpost four at this velocity, sir. There can't be much doubt who's attacking, sir. We know Outpost four has been attacked, sir, so if we intercept Romulans now You'll know, sir. They're painted like a giant bird-of-prey. Family history. There was a Captain Stiles was in the space service then. Two Commanders and several junior officers. All lost in that war, sir. Yes, sir. All weapons to full power. Phaser control room. Energise. Acknowledge. Outpost four now five minutes away, sir. Don't you mean interception course, sir? Captain, may I respectfully remind the Captain what has happened? The Romulans have crossed the Neutral Zone, attacked our outposts, killed our men. Add to that the fact it was a sneak attack. Negative, sir. I'm pointing our that we could have Romulan spies aboard this ship. Give it to Spock. Nothing, sir. I was suggesting that Mister Spock could probably translate it for you, sir. I'm not sure, sir. You do, sir. We'll enter the Neutral Zone in less than an hour, sir. Assuming, of course, that we don't turn back. To be used in chasing them or retreating, sir? We have to attack immediately. They're still on our side of the Neutral Zone. There would be no doubt they broke the treaty. Aim with sensors. Not accurate, but if we blanket them And if we don't? Once back, they'll report that we saw their weapons and ran. These are Romulans! You run away from them and you guarantee war. They'll be back. Not just one ship but with everything they've got. You know that, Mister Science Officer. You've the expert on these people, always left out that one point. Why? I'm very interested in why. We know what they look like. Phaser weapons energised. Set for proximity blast. Computed. On the board, sir. Traverse pattern. All phasers fire. Estimate it'll overtake us in two minutes, sir. It must have a range limit. We'll enter the Neutral Zone in one minute, Captain. Sir, at this distance? A phaser hit at this distance would be the wildest stroke of luck. Phasers show ready, sir. Twenty seconds to Neutral Zone, sir. What? Coming around, sir. Phasers, fire. Phasers, fire! Sir, my first assignment was in weapons control. Negative. This time, we'll handle things without your help, Vulcan. Tomlinson! I'm alive, sir. But I wouldn't be. Mister Spock pulled me out of the phaser room. He saved my life. He risked his life after I"
1192,TOS,episode 14,CENTURION,"If an Earth ship, why does he not attack? Take care, Commander. He has friends, and friends of his kind mean power. And power is danger. We've seen a hundred campaigns together, and still I do not understand you. If we are the strong, isn't this the signal for war? Our portion, Commander, is obedience. You spoke of entrapment."
1193,TOS,episode 14,ANGELA,"Phaser control acknowledging. All weapons energising to full. You won't get off my hook this easily. I'm going to marry you, Mister, battle or phaser weapons notwithstanding. Acknowledge. All weapons batteries ready. I'm all right. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc.

We are beaten. Can it be true? The Praetor's finest and proudest flagship beaten. Yes Commander, but only for self-destruction. Yes, Commander. At once. Glorious. Glorious. They're at our mercy. Commander, I remind you of your duty. Still no sign of movement, Commander. And it is our duty to crush the Praetor's enemies. We are in the Neutral Zone. They will not enter.

1209,TOS,episode 15,SPOCK,"They should be sending up a report momentarily, Captain. Something wrong? Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is not in need of rest. Myself excepted, of course. Not necessary in my case, Captain. On my planet, to rest is to rest, to cease using energy. To me, it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it. Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss. I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log. We have a crewmember aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue. Reaction time down nine to twelve percent, associational reading norm minus three. He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take rest and rehabilitation. Now, He has that right, but we've found James Kirk. Enjoy yourself, Captain. It's an interesting planet. You'll find it quite pleasant. Very much like your Earth. Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts, or force fields of any kind. Only peace, sunshine, and good air. You'll have no problems. Captain. I'm getting strange readings from the planet surface, Captain. Some sort of power field down there. A highly sophisticated type of energy draining our power and increasing, beginning to affect our communications. Could be coming from beneath the planet's surface. Patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity. Any chance these could be hallucinations? That sounds like a painful reality. There must be some logical explanation. Your signal is very weak. Can you turn up your gain? Captain, shall I beam down an armed party? Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless to us now. As I told you before, there's an unusual power field down here. It's soaking up all the energy at the source. I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just might be able to transport one more person. This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of course. This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass. I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured. All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing. Just as pleasant or just as deadly. At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very scientific. There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless. Captain, what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people you described? Captain, wait. Did you enjoy it, Captain? Which supports a theory I've been formulating. Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us. Yes. We must all control our thoughts. The force field we encountered is obviously underground, manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just for example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger Captain. The term is amusement park. An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and do all sorts of fascinating things. I tend to agree. Captain, I'll go back aboard ship and take over. With all due respect to the young lady, I've already had as much shore leave as I care for. Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen? Most illogical."

You know, you have to see this place to believe it. It's like something out of Alice in Wonderland. The Captain has to come down. He needs it. You've got your problems, I've got mine. He's got ours, plus his, plus four hundred and thirty other people's. Where are you going? Sulu! Did you see them? Captain, are you beaming down? Well, either our scouting probes and detectors are malfunctioning, and all us scouts careless and beauty-intoxicated, or I must report myself unfit for duty. On this supposedly uninhabited planet, I just saw a large rabbit Pull a gold watch from his vest and claim that he was late. As a matter of fact, yes. And they disappeared through a hole in a hedge. Over here. Over here. As a matter of fact, I do, but this is not one of them. Look at this. I saw what I saw, or maybe I hallucinated it, but I want you to take a look and tell me what you think about it. Negative. He was examining the flora at the time. Collecting specimens. You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim? Well, no. Absolutely. No birds, no mammals, no insects, nothing. I'm certain our readings weren't off. Well, it could have been worse. You could have seen the rabbit. Well, yeah, I'm beginning to feel a little bit picked on, if that's what you mean. And you being the very serious young A girl's footprints. The young blonde girl I saw chasing it. Good. I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim. What was it? Sounds like Don Juan. Did you find Mister Sulu, Captain? Did you find Mister Sulu? Sir? Are you all right? Feeling better? It's a beautiful place. A little strange, I'll admit. I see what you mean, but then you'd have whole armies of Don Juans to fight off. And me, too. You are all of those things and many more. They'll look even lovelier with you wearing them. Now, look, I don't know how or why, but the dress is here. I'd like to see you in it. Why don't you put it on? My dear girl, I am a doctor. When I peek, it's in the line of duty. McCoy here. I can't read you very well. Is this Rodriguez? Right. What the devil's wrong with communications? Esteban. Esteban. This is where the Captain said to rendezvous. I swear I heard someone moving around. A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to protect her. These things cannot be real. Hallucinations can't harm us. Go back to where you were. Possibly because no one has died, Jim. I was taken below the surface for some rather remarkable repairs. It's amazing. They've got a factory complex down there you wouldn't believe. They can build or do anything immediately. Oh. Them. Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I know on Rigel Two, and, er, there were these two girls in the chorus line. And well, here they are. Well after all, I am on shore leave. Oh, yes. So you are. Well, girls, I suppose you can turn something up. It's what the doctor ordered, Jim. Indeed we did, Mister Spock."

To get some cell-structure records. A blade of grass, a bush, a tree, a flower petal. With these, we can tell the whole planet's biology. What is it? What's the matter? See what? I don't see anything. What is it, Doc? Target shooting, Captain. Isn't it a beauty? Haven't got anything like this in my collection. I found it. I know it's a crazy coincidence, but I've always wanted one like this. Found it lying right over there. An old-time police special, and in beautiful condition. Hasn't been one like this made in a couple of centuries. It fires lead pellets propelled by expanding gases from a chemical explosion. Captain, take cover! There's a Samurai after me. I mean, there was. Captain, you've got to believe me. Got a call a few minutes ago. Rodriguez. Said you were rendezvousing back at the glade. That's not all. So's my phaser. Yes, sir. Look. Someone beaming down from the bridge. We're stranded down here, Captain? Captain! Captain! You'd better have a look at this, sir. I don't understand. It's like a dummy, Captain. It couldn't be alive.

I have enough of that from Doctor McCoy, Yeoman. Thank you. Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant. Captain's log. Stardate 3025 er, point 3. We are orbiting an uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region. A planet remarkably like Earth, or how we remember Earth to be. Park-like, beautiful, green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful. Almost too good to be true. I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart. Dismissed. Mister Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first. Which section would you like to go with? Kirk here. Yes. Open a channel, Uhura. I hadn't planned to, Bones. Why? Explain. That's pretty good. I got one for you. The rabbit was followed by a little blonde girl, right? All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration. Captain out. That's a McCoy pill, with a little mystery sugar-coating. He wants to get me down there. I'm afraid I won't swallow it. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it? That's much too low a rating. A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins. That man will go a shore on my orders. What's his name? Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right? Good. That should be sufficient. Beam it up to Mister Spock when you're ready, and start enjoying yourselves. Thank you. Restful. After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a place this beautiful exists. McCoy! McCoy! Bones, know any good rabbit jokes lately? Footprints. Could be a rabbit. It would have to be an unusual creature to make this size tracks. What about Mister Sulu? Will he confirm what you saw? Bridge, this is the Captain. Has the first shore party beamed down yet? Get this message to all shore parties. Stand by. No one is to leave the ship. You're the doctor, Doctor. Can you explain this? Neither can I. I admit it looks harmless. It probably is harmless. But before I bring my people down here, I want proof it's harmless. What do you think you're doing? Where did you get it, Mister Sulu? Mister Sulu. I'll hang on to it. The fresh air seems to have made you trigger-happy. Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this planet? I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but. Yeoman Barrows, you accompany Mister Sulu. Find out where those tracks came from. Doctor, you come with me back to the glade. I'd like another look at that area. This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave. How? What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex? I know the feeling very well. I had it at the Academy. An upper classman there. One practical joke after another, and always on me. My own personal devil. A guy by the name of Finnegan. Serious? I'll make a confession, Bones. I was absolutely grim, which delighted Finnegan no end. He's the kind of guy to put a bowl of cold soup in your bed or a bucket of water propped on a half-open door. You never knew where he'd strike next. More tracks. Looks like your rabbit came from over there. Yes. You follow the rabbit. I'll backtrack the girl. I'll meet you around the other side of the hill. Finnegan? I can't believe it. All right, let's try that one again. Go! Yeoman Barrows. What happened? Who was? Barrows, give me a report. Are you sure you're not imagining all this? Mister Sulu was with you. Where is he now? Stay with her, Doctor. Mister Sulu! Sulu! Mister Sulu! Sulu! Sulu! Ruth? Ruth. McCoy, do you read me? Ruth. Ruth, how can it be you? How could you possibly be here? You haven't aged. It's been fifteen years. Kirk here. What? No, but I'm sure he's all right. Yes, I'm fine. Yes, Mister Rodriguez. Don't you like birds, Mister Rodriguez? Mister Rodriguez, have the search parties rendezvous at the glade. I'd like some answers to all this. I don't want to. You haven't told me. You haven't told me Ruth. Kirk here. Yes, Mister Spock. Specify. Can you pinpoint the source? Keep me posted, Mister Spock. We'll continue our investigation down here. Captain out. You're the science officer, Mister Spock. I want some answers. First there was McCoy's Alice in Wonderland where there was supposedly no animal life. And Sulu's gun where there's no refined metal detected. Rodriguez' birds. And then my, well, the two people I saw. One hallucination flattened me with a clout on the jaw. The other. Yes. I'm already on maximum. Negative. Our people here are armed with phasers. Besides, there's yet to be any real danger. Captain out. McCoy. McCoy, do you read me? Kirk to McCoy. Come in. A what? I do. I've met some interesting personalities myself. Have you seen any of the others while I've been gone? I hope he got through to everybody. Communications are almost out. Yeah. We'd better get to the glade. Trying to. Something's obstructing it. Mister Spock, my orders were no one was to leave the ship. Good. We can use your help. Until we can find out what this is all about. That way. Spread out. Let's find it. No. Yeoman! We're in trouble. I need every crewman alert and thinking. Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I will. Tricorder? Mister Spock. What do you make of that? I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock. Are you saying this is a plant, Mister Spock? By who? And why? And why these particular things? McCoy's body? Spock? McCoy's death is a scientific fact. I was, I was thinking about the Academy. My days Finnegan. Finnegan! What's been happening to my people? Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem. That's an order, Mister Spock. I want some answers. Can you feel that? Finnegan. One thing Answers. A lot of things. What's been happening to my people? I'm not a plebe. This is today, fifteen years later. What are you doing here? Yes, I enjoyed it. After all these years. I did enjoy it. The one thing I wanted to do after all these years was to beat the tar out of Finnegan. That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment. Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about Difficult. Spock. We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them. Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows. Front and centre. Don't ask any questions, Sulu. Face front, everyone. Don't talk. Don't breathe. Don't think. You're at attention. Concentrate on that and only that. Concentrate. Who are you? You know my name? Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through? Yes, play, Mister Sulu. The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play. But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon. You say your people built all this. Who are you? What planet are you from? Kirk here. No, everything is in order, Lieutenant. Stand by. Lieutenant. Commence transporting shore leave parties. Tell them to prepare for the best shore leave they've ever had. Kirk out. No, Mister Spock. I'll go. You. On the other hand, I'll stay for a day or two. Yes, we did, Mister Spock. I think we did. Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc.

We've just discovered you don't understand all this. These experiences were intended to amuse you. But none of this is permanent. Here you have to only imagine your fondest wishes, either old ones you wish to relive or new ones, anything at all. Battle, fear, love, triumph. Anything that pleases you can be made to happen. Of course. This entire planet was constructed for our race of people to come and play. Exactly, Captain. How very perceptive of you. We regret that some of you've been made uncomfortable. My impression is that your race is not yet ready to understand us, Captain. However. If you would use the proper caution, this amusement planet of ours could be an ideal place for your people to enjoy themselves, if you wish."

Captain's orders. Rendezvous at that glade where he first found you. Of all the crazy things. Remember what I was telling you a while ago, about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used? That's one of them. Not unless it makes a strafing run. The way they used to attack people on the ground. Come on. Angela."

He had a cloak, sir, and a dagger with jewels on it. Captain, I know it sounds incredible, but I did not imagine it any more than I imagined he did this. Yes. Yes. It was so sort of story book walking around here, and I was thinking, all a girl needs is Don Juan. Just day dreaming, the way you would about someone you'd like to meet. He ran after him. A little, but I wouldn't want to be alone here. That's just it. It's almost too beautiful. I was thinking, even before my tunic was torn, that in a place like this a girl should be, oh let's see now, a girl should be dressed like a fairy-tale princess, with lots of floaty stuff and a tall hat with a veil. Is that a promise, Doctor? Oh, Doctor, they're lovely. Look at me, Doctor. A lady to be protected and fought for. A princess of the blood royale. Doctor, I'm afraid. All right, but you stay right there. Don't peek. There's no one here. Don't talk like that. He's dead. Captain's log, supplemental. All contact with the Enterprise has been lost. We're trapped here.

Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer. Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. We are out of control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki three one two. Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull. Course three point two five I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma. Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister Scott. I think you'll find your work is cut out for you. Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all the alternatives. Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please. Just the facts, Doctor. Thank you for your opinion. It will be duly noted. You're recording this, Yeoman? Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please. Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister Scott to do his work. Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the ship. Under present conditions, extremely poor. If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is, Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual contact only. On those terms, this is a very large planet. Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long time, Doctor. My big chance? For what, Doctor? I am a logical man, Doctor. Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be done. Excuse me. In what way? The weight of three grown men. Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit. There's very little excess weight, except among the passengers. Unless the situation changes radically, yes. As commanding officer, the choice will be mine. A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots. My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical means. But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in the event we've overlooked any minor damage. Come on, Boma. What was it? Nothing there. I don't doubt your word. Folsom Point. There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient. Am I in error, Mister Boma? Then what, Mister Boma? My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister Boma. Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our repair efforts. If you need assistance, I Perhaps if you were to channel the second auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve. Excellent, Doctor. Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds overweight. It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor. You might be wise to start. For what? Mister Boma, we're working against time. Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion. My place is here. If you please, Doctor. By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our chances of staying alive. Well, Mister Scott. What happened? That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind. Consider the alternatives, Mister Scott. Mister Scott, there are always alternatives. Wood rubbing on some kind of leather. Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More likely a loose association of some sort. How, Mister Boma? I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for life. Mister Boma? Doctor McCoy? It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life indiscriminately, I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third course. I think not. Doctor McCoy. You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in any way possible. We'll be back shortly. Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only when so instructed, and at my designated targets. We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill. I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the responsibility will be mine. Follow me. I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe. Direct your phasers to two o'clock and to ten o'clock. Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim please, and fire when I give a signal. Fire. Cease fire. They should think twice before bothering us again. It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done. Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo. Mister Gaetano, you remain on guard here. Keep in contact with the ship. Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again. Go, Mister Scott. That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply. They would also seem to be our only hope. Yeoman, your phaser. They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with luck, we'll be gone. We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor, your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott. Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor. And give this to Mister Scott in the event I don't return. I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please. Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons. They should have fled. Of course. Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability. They're studying us, for the moment. My opinion, Mister Boma. Seal the windows! Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile. Curious. Most illogical. Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical decisions. And yet two men have died. I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than the whole. A little less analysis and more action. That's what we need, Mister Spock. How much longer, Mister Scott? Mister Scott, how much power do we have left in the ship's batteries? Will they electrify the exterior of this ship? Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott? All right. Go. Again! Again! I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you continue draining the phasers. For the moment. The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be back. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's anything you can unload to lighten the ship. It will of course have to be left behind. I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away. It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril. Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial, provided the creatures will permit it. How about weight? And how long can we hold it? To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility. Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott? Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You have that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, it appears to be clear outside, at least for the moment. I'll assist you. Hurry. Get into the ship! Immediate lift off! No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No! All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go, Scott! I told you to lift off! Get us off, Scott! Quite right, Mister Scott. There's somebody holding us down. All systems are go, but we're not moving. Our boosters. Would you rather stay here? May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we maintain it long. An hour from now we may be right back where we started from. Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what slim chance you had for survival. The logical thing for you to have done was to have left me behind. That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister Scott. Fuel status? It is the usual end of a decaying orbit. Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on the planet's surface, I should think. Did l? I may have been mistaken. The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for one do not believe in angels. Yes. My first command. Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. Perhaps, Mister Boma. No one out there to see it. Totally illogical. There was no chance. Captain. Quite correct, Captain. Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at. Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but those are essentially the facts. No, sir. Yes, sir. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc.

It's type M, oxygen, nitrogen, and it's listed as Taurus Two. It's unexplored. As far as we can determine with our equipment malfunction, it's just about dead-centre of the Murasaki effect. Nothing, Captain. All wavelengths dominated by ionisation effects, sir. Transmission is blocked, reception impossible.

Nitrogen one forty. Breathable, if you're not running in competition. Traces of argon, neon, krypton, all in acceptable quantities. However, I wouldn't recommend this place as a summer resort. What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise? But they'll be looking for us. Then you don't think they'll find us. Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's your big chance. Command. Oh, I know you, Mister Spock. You've never voiced it, but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to build command. Am I right? It'll take more than logic to get us out of this. Or the equivalent weight in equipment. Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical. Not his head, Mister Boma, his heart. His heart. This should save us at least fifty pounds, Mister Spock. I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind. Now whatever it is that's out there I'm not talking about rationality. Mister Spock, that's your place. Now look. We may all die here. At least let us die like men, not machines. Mister Spock! Something's happening outside. What do those supersensitive ears make of that, Mister Spock? Seems logical to me. Yes. Right. I hope not. Scotty has an idea. Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence. Just where are you going? I don't know. He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind. You tell me. Well, it won't unless we get these phasers back. Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did they? You mean they should have respected us? Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occur to you they might react emotionally, with anger? They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling. You might as well admit it, Mister Spock, your precious logic brought them down on us. Studying us, Mister Spock? They seem to learn rather quickly. And you've brought our furry friends down on us. How much longer, Mister Scott? That won't be long enough. It must've worked. Mister Boma. Don't be a fool, Mister Spock. We couldn't leave you out there. We got off! Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of your logic. After that? Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that. Is there anything we can do? Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command. How long have we got now, Scotty? It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it was all human. That's exactly what I mean."

1360,TOS,episode 16,SCOTT,"What a mess. You don't really expect to get an answer, do you? Logical. Very bad, Mister Spock. We've lost a great deal of fuel. We have no chance at all to reach escape velocity. And if we ever hope to make orbit, we'll have to lighten our load by at least five hundred pounds. Aye, you could put it that way. It's too delicate. It may not be able to take the pressure as it is. If you'll give me a hand with this conduit. Pressure's dropping. We're losing everything. One of the lines gave. The strain of coming through the atmosphere and the added load when we tried to bypass. Yes, that's done it. We have no fuel. We have no fuel! What alternatives? It's dangerous, but it might work. I can adjust the main reactor to function with a substitute fuel supply. Aye, we do. Our phasers. I can adapt them and use their energy. It'll take time, but it's possible. Aye. If I can get a full load, we should be able to achieve orbit with all hands. Not that we can maintain it long. Aye, aye, sir. Another hour, maybe two. Doctor, a phaser can only drain so fast. You've got your hands full. Captain's Log, stardate 2823.1. Our landing parties are on the surface of Taurus Two. We continue to hope. Instruments are slowly returning to an operable condition as the ion storm slowly disperses. On the ship, we can only wait helplessly. They're in good shape, but they won't lift us off, if that's what you're getting at. That they will, Mister Spock! Ready, Mister Spock. I daren't use any more. Not and be sure of ignition. Aye. That's enough! That's it. If we shed every ounce, we might be able to achieve orbit. A few hours, no longer. But if we time it right, we can cut out of orbit and save enough fuel for a controlled re=entry. We have very few alternatives, Mister Spock. Maybe eight minutes if the weight's right. Aye, aye, sir. We should be moving, but we're not. What are you doing? We'll never be able to hold orbit. No, Mister Spock. Fifteen pounds psi. Approximately enough for one orbit, sir. Tapping our boosters ended our last chance for a soft landing. Mister Spock, you said a while ago that there were always alternatives. Orbit attitude, Mister Spock. With our present fuel, that gives us about forty five minutes. Mister Spock! He jettisoned the fuel and ignited it. The orbit'll start decaying as soon as the fuel's exhausted. Say six minutes. A distress signal? It's like sending up a flare. Mister Spock, that was a good gamble. Perhaps it was worth it. Orbit decaying, Mister Spock. Ten seconds to atmosphere."
1361,TOS,episode 16,KIRK,"Captain to shuttlecraft Galileo. Stand by, Mister Spock. No problem, Commissioner. And may I remind you that I have standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena wherever they may be encountered. Besides, it's three days to Makus. And the rendezvous doesn't take place for five. No problem. Captain to Galileo. All systems cleared for take off. Launch shuttlecraft. Anything at all? Try and get me a fix on the Galileo. That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of our instruments work. At least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity. And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot shuttlecraft, off course, out of control. Finding a needle in a haystack would be child's play. Captain's Log, stardate 2821.7. The electromagnetic phenomenon known as Murasaki Three Twelve whirls like some angry blight in space, a depressive reminder that seven shipmates still have not been heard from. Equally bad, the effect has rendered our normal searching systems useless. Without them, we are blind and almost helpless. I'm aware of that, Commissioner. At the same time I have certain scientific duties I must perform, and investigating the Murasaki effect is one. We have two days to find them. What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there? Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu. Set course for Taurus Two. If they're not there, Commissioner, then they're dead by now. Mister Sulu. Anything on your scanners? Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power? Transport room, this is the captain speaking. Are the transporters beaming up yet? Thank you. This is the captain speaking. Flight deck, prepare Columbus for immediate exit, for a search of the planet surface. Correlate co-ordinates with Mister Sulu. Thank you. Anything, Uhura? We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner. Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment. I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner. I know all about your authority. Launch shuttlecraft Columbus. Have them proceed to the next quadrant. Any word from engineering on our sensors? What about the transporters? Thank you, Lieutenant. Yes, Commissioner? I haven't forgotten, Commissioner. I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner. This is the captain. Try using overload power on the transporters. We've got to get them working. Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every lap from now on. It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of the planet's surface. Mind your helm, Mister Sulu. Good. This is the captain. Landing parties one, two, and three, report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the planet. Ordinance condition One A. I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant. It's almost the only tool we have that'll work. What word from the sensor section? I'm not interested in the last report. I want to know now. I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left. You do that. What about radio communication? Do? I intend to continue the search. Foot by foot, inch by inch, by candlelight if necessary, until the last possible moment. And if you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful. I'm in command here, Mister Ferris. Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual. Report. There are casualties? Thank you, Lieutenant. You'd better report to Sickbay yourself. But they're still out there. The Columbus hasn't returned yet. I still have two search parties out. Lieutenant. Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search parties from the surface. Attempt to contact the Columbus. Then have them return immediately. Mister Sulu, prepare to abandon search. Set course for Makus Three. Captain's log, supplement. The search parties have returned to the ship, and the Columbus is on its way back. I have been compelled to abandon the search. What about the other systems? Stand ready, Mister Sulu. How long before the Columbus comes on board? Twenty three minutes. Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal speed. Those are my orders. Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections to direct beams aft. Full function, continuous operation until further orders. Sensors, a meteorite? A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, contact transporter room. All beams ready. Full normal speed. Activate beams. Mister Sulu, proceed on course to Makus Three. Ahead warp factor one. Mister Spock. There's really something I don't understand about all of this. Maybe you can explain it to me. Logically, of course. When you jettisoned the fuel and ignited it, you knew there was virtually no chance of it being seen, yet you did it anyhow. That would seem to me to be an act of desperation. Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does your well-known logic explain that? I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst. You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life, you committed a purely human emotional act? Mister Spock, you're a stubborn man."

Your mission is to get those emergency medical supplies to Makus Three in time for their transfer to the New Paris colonies. I don't like to take chances. The plague is out of control on New Paris. We must get those drugs there on time. What is it, Captain? I was opposed to this from the very beginning. Our flight to Makus Three is of the very highest priority. Yes, but you've lost your crew. Two days? ln all that? Two days? You shouldn't have sent them out in the first place. Do you know what you've done? You've concerned yourself with only seven people. You said something about a needle in a haystack. It's useless. Well, Captain? You don't really think you'll have any luck, do you? Very well, Captain, but not one second beyond that moment. Is that clear? If it isn't, I suggest you look at book nineteen, section four thirty three, paragraph twelve. Captain. I don't relish the thought of abandoning your crewmen out there, however I must remind you You're running out of time. Twenty four more hours, Captain. You have two hours and forty three minutes, Captain. I'm delighted. However I shall continue to remind you. What do you intend to do? I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your diligence, Captain. I'm not sure they'll appreciate the way you address a High Commissioner. You are, Captain. For another two hours and forty two minutes. Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You'll see that it is 2823.8. Your time is up. So are the plague victims on New Paris. I'm sorry, Captain. I now assume authority granted me under Title fifteen, Galactic Emergency Procedures, and I order you to abandon search. You're procrastinating, Captain. You have your orders. Recall your search parties and proceed to Makus Three immediately."
1472,TOS,episode 16,KELOWITZ,"Kelowitz, Captain. We were attacked, Captain. Huge, furry creatures. I checked with astral anthropology, and they're order 480G, anthropoid. Similar to life forms discovered on Hansen's Planet, but much larger. Ten, twelve feet in height. Ensign O'Neal got a spear through the body before we even knew they were around. Lieutenant lmmamura has a dislocated shoulder and severe lacerations, but he'll make it all right. Captain, the creatures are all over the place.

I can't be sure, but I'd say that, the magnetic potential of the effect was Thank you. Was such that, as we gathered speed, it was multiplied geometrically. And we were simply shot into the centre of the effect. Like a projectile. You mean three of us must stay behind. And who's to choose? You wouldn't be interested in drawing lots? All right, Mister Spock. Who? If any minor damage was overlooked, it was when they put his head together. Did you see what it was? Poor Latimer. We'll get off all right. Sir? Not very efficient? Is that all you have to say? You? Error? Impossible. There's a man lying there dead, and you talk about stone spears. What about Latimer? Mister Spock. we're ready. The services for Latimer. The man's dead. He deserves a decent burial. You're the captain. A few words. Not necessarily. It could be a simple tribal rite, assuming a tribal culture. We know enough. If they're tribal, they'll have a sense of unity. We can use that. By hitting them hard. Give them a bloody nose. Make them think twice about attacking us. Absolutely. The mists. I can't see them. Nobody knows what's happened to Gaetano, and you hand over his phaser like nothing's happened at all. Do you really think the ship will ever leave? Another prediction, Mister Spock? All right, Spock, you have all the answers. What now? My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile, Mister Spock! I'm sick and tired of your logic! How long do you think those plates will hold out under this? We've got to do something! For the moment? Mister Gaetano's body's back there. Not without a burial. Not without a burial, Mister Spock. I'll take that chance. You see, Mister Spock, I would insist upon a decent burial even if your body was back there. I'm sick and tired of this machine! They let go! You mean a burn-up? I admire your ability to make so measured a choice. We need that fuel to maintain orbit. Are you out of your mind?"
1474,TOS,episode 16,GAETANO,"Yes. II don't know. It's from up there. It's everywhere. It's all around us! It was something huge, terrible. Up there. I think I hit it. Vaguely. It was like a giant ape. At least it was quick for him. I tell you there was. But there must be something. I swear I hit it. Mister Spock. In the interest of efficiency, I don't think we should leave his body here. We'll do it. Give me a hand with Latimer, will you? Captain's Log, stardate 2822.3. We continue to search, but I find it more difficult each moment to ward off a sense of utter futility and great loss. They're getting ready. They'll attack. Yes, I agree. If we stand by and do nothing, we're just giving them an invitation to come down and slaughter us. Well, we're practical about it. I say we hit them before they hit us. The majority. That could get us killed. Now you're talking. Oh, for the. You saw what they did to Latimer! I say we hit them dead on. I still say we should have killed them."

Of course, Mister Spock. We should be able to scrape up another hundred pounds. If we knew more about them Did you find them? But what if the creatures attack again? Why haven't they done anything? We could use a little inspiration. Enterprise, this is Galileo. Come in, please. Enterprise. Nothing, sir. Just ionic interference. We're moving! I don't want to die up here. What happened? It's getting hot."

I fail to understand your romantic nostalgia for such a place. Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Moving on schedule into quadrant nine oh four. Beta Six is eight days distant. Unusual, Captain. I'm now getting a sizable space-displacement reading. Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records. Emergency! Full reverse power! Ship's log Stardate 2124.5. First Officer Spock reporting for Captain James Kirk. We are orbiting the lone unrecorded planet in the star desert. For four hours, we have made every possible instrument sweep, but Captain Kirk and Helmsman Sulu remain unaccounted for. I have placed the ship on red alert. Function is normal. Continuous sensor sweeps. Lieutenant Uhura, have you checked all wave bands? The decision will be mine, Doctor. I have the responsibility for your safety. Mister Jaeger, describe your geophysical findings for the surface below. Estimate survival time of two unprotected individuals down there. Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. Send this, Lieutenant. Enterprise to signaler on planet surface. Identify self. Hip hip hoorah? And I believe it's pronounced tally ho. I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any at all. You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter room. No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared here. Mister DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear. Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there. Doctor McCoy will accompany. If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question. Dismissed. Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott. Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately. Use the laser beacon if necessary. Ready, Scott? Activate. I don't, Mister Scott. It simply exists. Artificial perhaps, or a freak of nature. The fact remains that life can exist in that area. Apply a fine tuning on our sensors. Locate any life forms in that stable area. Affirmative. But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's where he'll have to be. We'll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect. Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott. And this, of course, is an array of your battle flags and pennants dating back to the Crusades, to Hannibal's invaders, the Grecian war galleys, and the hordes of Persia. Can't you imagine it, Captain? The thousands of men marching off to their deaths, singing beneath these banners. Doesn't it make your blood run swiftly? They didn't, Captain. Not clearly. We merely beamed up all life forms in a given area. I am Spock. My father is from the planet Vulcan. Not generally. But there have been exceptions. Affirmative. I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I object to power without constructive purpose. It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical. Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected. In this case, I should think interesting would suffice. That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour? No. It simply means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms, but none of the substance. Evidently. Is it ego, or something else? The mirror. You noted yourself he never gets very far from it. I suppose it could be vanity. A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by thought waves. It would have a very complex memory bank, and would be extremely sophisticated. KIRK; Like a computer, only much more. Could the machine that maintains the environment in this immediate area be kept in this house? I think not. A device capable of keeping out this planet's natural atmosphere would be immense. Free, Captain? Captain. The machine. Can we know his range is, Captain? Collision course. That was the planet Gothos, Captain. Gothos again, Captain. Cat and mouse game. Or it toward us. Captain, we're receiving you. Captain. For the record, how do we describe him? Pure mentality? Force of intellect? Embodied energy? Superbeing? He must be classified, sir. I hardly find that fitting. It will make a strange entry in the library banks. Mischievous pranks, Captain? I shall be delighted, Captain. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc.

Obviously there's life on that planet. Where are your storms, Jaeger? No response. In the name of heaven, where are we? There's no reading. They're like waxworks figures. You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu. We've been looking for you for four hours. Better say, what is he? I monitored him, and what I found was unbelievable. Not in the way we define life. No trace. Zero. It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead. Captain, receiving a transporter signal. Which means Trelane is not a life form as we know it, or he'd be beaming through now. I'm quaking, but I don't know if it's from laughter or terror. Well, it was a. Oh, forget it.

We're nine hundred light years from that kind of desert, Bones. Something, Mister Spock? Can you verify that, Navigator? Put it on visual. And yet, here it is. No time to investigate. Science stations, gather data for computer banks. Uhura, notify the discovery on subspace radio. Let's get out of its range. Veer forty degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu. Sulu! What happened? Fill me in. I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise. Who are you? Where do you come from? General Trelane, retired. At your service, sirs. My home is your home. Then you've been looking in on the doings nine hundred years past. General Trelane. For what purpose have you imprisoned us here? Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest. When we do battle, it is only because we have no choice. I must ask you to let us go back to our ship. Not yet. Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle. This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator. Doctor McCoy, our medical officer. Mister Sulu, our helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist. Who will you start with, my crew? Are we your next targets? That's correct. Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise. This drawing room, did you create it by rearranging matter on this planet? I see. How did you manage Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here. Not alive? Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present day Earth without taking into account the time differential. Whatever we're dealing with, he certainly isn't all knowledgeable. He makes mistakes. Trelane, we haven't planned If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty too. Our ship has need of us. We have tasks to perform. For how long? Until what is over? Trelane, even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing us. There are four hundred men and women aboard that ship. No. This game has gone on long enough. Those are crucial operating personnel. You can't It means, Trelane, the party's over, thanks to Mister Spock. Everyone to stations. Report, Mister Spock. How were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field? Prepare to warp out of here at once. Maximum speed. Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines. We're going to put a hundred million miles between us and that madman. Trelane. On the contrary. I commend his action. Get off my ship. We're not going anywhere. DeSalle. Trelane, let him go. This is General Trelane. Lieutenant Uhura of communications. No doubt. Yeoman Teresa Ross. I believe you have met our science officer Mister Spock. Until we can think our way out. Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality. You don't find this unexpected, Mister Spock? And if he's fallible, he can't be all powerful. Which means he has something helping him. A machine? A device? Something which does these things for him. That mirror. It's part of his audience, his ego. He never wanders from it. Explain. What about it? No, no, Mister Spock, that's not the reason. What kind of a machine could do these things? Good. I agree. That leaves me free . If I'm not mistaken, Mister Spock, I think I can turn his lights off at the source. Don't be too upset by what you see, gentlemen. After all, his actions are those of an immature, unbalanced mind. You only heard part of it. I just started. Yes. I want you to leave my crewmen alone. I want you to leave my crewwomen alone too. You're not to dance with him. I don't like it. I don't want you accepting his gifts, either. I don't care what you believe, just keep your hands off her! I've had enough of your insulting attentions to her. If it's fighting that you want, you may have it. If you have the courage. Are you ready? Enough talk. Let's get on with it. We shoot together. All right. Try to contact the ship. Go on, Trelane. Look at it. It's over. Your power is blanked out. You're finished. Trelane! Everyone, we're getting out of here. Now. This is the Captain. Commence beaming up. Maximum speed. Set course for Colony Beta Six. Full power acceleration from orbit, Mister Scott. Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment, Mister Sulu. Not yet. They may trace our beam. Wait until we're well out of range. We can take an educated guess. At the point we entered their solar system. Good. Yes, I think you might. Turn in your glass slippers. The ball is over. Hard to believe it ever happened. Hard to port, Mister Sulu. Gothos? Mister Sulu, have we been going in circles? Hard over, Mister Sulu. With us as the mouse. Ninety degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu. Ninety degrees sub-port, Mister Sulu. Adjust. Decelerate into orbit. Prepare transporter room. Yes, I am, Doctor McCoy. I am going to see our playful Mister Trelane and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship. Stand by communications. Mister Spock. If you don't receive a message from me within the hour, leave the vicinity at once. No turning back. Trelane. I've had enough of your games. I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane. I've come for one purpose. To get back my ship. We've made you angry with our will to survive, haven't we? Then vent your anger on me alone. I was the one who led the others. I was the one who shot out your mirror machine. I took that chance. I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong. Yes, anything! Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey. You pompous Those people have done you no harm. We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement. I'm glad you weren't disappointed. Trelane, if you think I'm going to cheerfully and obediently stick my head in that noose That's your problem, Trelane. Everything is easy. It's given you a bad habit. You're not aware of it, but you have it. You don't think, Trelane. That's your problem. You miss opportunities, like your anger before and mine right now. Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why? Because you're a bumbling, inept fool. Here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique, and you're wasting it. You want to commit murder? Go ahead, but where's the sport in a simple hanging? Yes. The terror of murder. The suspense. The fun. A personal conflict between us. Not like the duel before, but the real thing. The stakes, a human life. Mine. That's the idea. Yes, but you can do better than that. There's still not enough sport in just killing me with a sword. It strikes me very well. But you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane. Why not up the stakes? Yes. While we're playing our game, free my ship. Let it continue on its way. In return, I'll give you a contest you'll remember. Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go. Enterprise. Enterprise, can you hear me? Enterprise. Enterprise. Remember, Trelane. You promised to let my ship go. You haven't won, Trelane. But you haven't won anything. No! Does it still taste as sweet? But I'm not defeated. You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane. In fact, you've got a lot to learn about everything, haven't you? Who are you? Who is Trelane? Captain to Enterprise. Captain to Enterprise. Beam me up, Mister Spock. We're free to go. Normal orbit approach procedures, Mister Sulu. Mister Spock. Still thinking about Trelane, is that it? God of war, Mister Spock. Then a small boy, and a very naughty one at that. Then he was a very strange small boy. One the other hand, he was probably doing things comparable to the same mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy. Yes. Dipping little girls' curls in inkwells. Stealing apples from the neighbours' trees. Tying cans on Forgive me, Mister Spock. I should have known better."

They're beings, Trelane. They have spirit. They're superior. Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make any more planets. No, Trelane. Captain, we regret that the life paths of yourself and your companions have been disturbed. We would not have let him intercept you had we realised your vulnerability."
1622,TOS,episode 17,JAEGER,"No detectable soil or vegetation. Extremely hot, toxic atmosphere swept by tornadic storm. Continuous volcanic eruptions. Deadly to any lifeforms such as we know it without oxygen and life-support systems. Not very long. Atmosphere exactly the same as ours. Notice the period, Captain. Nine hundred light years from Earth. It's what might be seen through a viewing scope if it were powerful enough. I'm a scientist, not a military man. Notice the wood fire, Captain? Burning steadily, ember bed glowing, and it doesn't give off any heat at all."
1623,TOS,episode 17,DESALLE,"All clear ahead, Captain. The sensors indicate zero register. No, sir. Forward sweeps are negative. Wait. Verified, sir. We must be in some sort of light warp or we'd have picked it up earlier. Iron-silica body, planet sized, magnitude one E. We'll be passing close. Mister Spock, they're gone! No sign of human life on the surface, sir. Unless the instruments aren't functioning. With due respect, sir. Request permission to transport to the surface immediately and carry out a search. Some kind of a joke, sir? DeSalle to Enterprise. DeSalle to Enterprise. It doesn't function. We're cut off. Keep trying with yours. Something's blocking the beacon. I've got to find open ground. Mister Jaeger! McCoy! Look. We've lost contact with the ship, Captain. We're trapped here. My ancestry is French, yes. You Captain, subspace interference is clearing. Large body ahead. There it is again. Dead ahead. Approach channels clear, Captain."
1624,TOS,episode 17,TRELANE,"I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite display pair, but I suppose you want them back now. Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of Gothos. You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here, but when I saw you passing by I simply could not resist. Ah, so you're the Captain of these brave lads. My greetings and felicitations, Captain. So good of you and your officers to drop in. Absolutely smashing. I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the very planet that I've made my hobby. Yes, but according to my observations, I didn't think you capable of such voyages. Ah, yes. I've been looking in on the doings on your lively little Earth. Oh, really? Have I made an error in time? How fallible of me. Oh, I did so want to make you feel at home. I'm quite proud of the detail. Retired, sir. Just Squire Trelane now. And you may call me Squire. Yes, I rather fancy that. Imprisoned? Nonsense. You're my guests. You see, I just finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society. You came by at the most propitious moment. I want to know all about your campaigns, your battles, your missions of conquest. Ah, but that's the official story, eh? I wouldn't hear of it. You shall join me in a repast. I want to learn all about your feelings on war and killing and conquest. That sort of thing. Do you know that you're one of the few predator species that preys even on itself? DeSalle, did you say? Un vrai Francais? Ah, monsieur. Vive la gloire. Vive Napoleon. You know, I admire your Napoleon very much. Welcome, good physicianer and honourable sir. Und Offizier Jaeger, und der deutsche Soldat, nein? Eins, zwei, drei, vier. Gehen vir mit dem Schiessgewehr. Oh come now. We're all military men under the skin. And how we do love our uniforms. What an interesting weapon you've got there. Do let me see it.  Oh, how marvellous! Devastating! Why, this could kill millions. Oh, how absolutely typical of your species. You don't understand something, so you become fearful. Now, do let me anticipate your next question. You want to know how I've managed all of this. We, meaning I and others, have, to state the matter briefly, perfected a system by which matter can be transferred to energy and back to matter again. Oh, a crude example of an infinitely more sophisticated process. You see, we not only transport matter from place to place, but we can alter its shape at will. Quite. Dear Captain, your inquiries are becoming tiresome. I want you to be happy. Free yourself of care. Let's enjoy ourselves in the spirit of martial good fellowship. Tut, tut, tut. You're being quite rude. You can't go. Apparently, you need another demonstration of my authority. Yes, quite. Now, that's a sample of the atmosphere of this planet outside my kindly influence. Now, you will behave yourself hereafter, won't you? Or I shall be very, very angry. Captain's Log Stardate 2125.7. Science Officer Spock reporting for Captain Kirk. We have completed fourteenth orbit of this planet without establishing contact with our missing officers or the parties sent to find them. Subspace communications remain blocked. However, by diverting impulse power to our sensors, we have made them operable, and we have detected one small area on the surface which seems relatively stable. Discussing deep laid plans, I'll wager. I cannot wait to see them evolve. Tut tut. Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of deception and stratagem. Quite the contrary. I have nothing but admiration for your whole species. Oh, I can't let you go now. I was getting a bit bored until you came. You must stay. I insist. Until this is over, of course. Dear Captain, so many questions. Make the most of an uncertain future. Enjoy yourself today. Tomorrow may never come at all. Yes, I must experience your sense of concern, your grief at the separation. Women? Do you mean that you actually have members of the fairer sex among your crew? Oh, how charming. And they must be all very beautiful. And I shall be so very gallant to them. Here, let me fetch them down at once. No? I can do anything I want. I should think you would have realised that by now. Transporter signal? What does he mean? You must tell me! Wait! I won't have this! I haven't dismissed you yet. Stop! I won't have this! Where are all your weapons, Captain? Don't you display your weapons? Don't fret, Captain. I'm only a bit upset with you, but this Mister Spock you mentioned, the one responsible for that unseemly, impudent act of taking you from me, which is he? Surely not an officer. He isn't quite human, is he? And are its natives predatory? Really? You will see to his punishment? But I don't like him. Oh, rot! You're all going back with me. Nonsense. I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos planned for all of you, and you shan't spoil it for me. Anyway, the decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate And tasteful. Don't you agree? But so much more fitting, honourable sir. Oh, what primitive fury. Why, he's the very soul of sublime savagery. Yes, of course. I forget that I shouldn't frighten you too much. But I warn you, you can't provoke me again. Come, everyone. Let's forget your bad manners. Let's be full of merry talk and sallies of wit. We have victuals to delight the palate and brave company to delight the mind. Come, Doctor, do partake. Ah, you've been quite derelict in your social duties, Captain. You haven't introduced me to the charming contingent of your crew. Retired. But if you prefer, you may address me as the lonely Squire of Gothos, dear ladies. Ah a Nubian prize. Taken on one of your raids of conquest, no doubt, Captain. She has the melting eyes of the queen of Sheba. The same lovely colouring. And this. Is this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Fair Helen, make me immortal with a kiss. You do realise, don't you, that it's in deference to the Captain that I brought you here? I don't know if I like your tone. It's most challenging. That's what you're doing, challenging me? Oh, Mister Spock, you do have one saving grace after all. You're ill-mannered. The human half of you, no doubt. Ah, come, my little wood nymph. Won't you dance with your swain? Give us some sprightly music, my dear girl. Of course you do. Ah, my dear, don't we make a graceful pair? Except for one small detail. That dress hardly matches this charming scene. Ah, yes, that's more what we want. The dashing warrior and his elegant lady. I overheard that remark, Captain. I'm afraid I'll have to dispense with you. Oh? Does it actually make you angry, Captain? Well, I do believe the dear Captain is jealous of me. Oh, how curiously human. How wonderfully barbaric. Of course you have. After all, that's the root of the matter, isn't it? You fight for the attention, the admiration, the possession of women. Are you challenging me to a duel? Oh, this is better than I'd planned. I shall not shirk an affair of honour. A matched set. Just like the pair that slew your heroic Alexander Hamilton. And Captain, I never miss. Captain's Log, stardate 2126.1. Delayed report. The whole bridge crew are the unwilling guests of the creature who calls himself Trelane. We are weaponless, powerless, and our only hope of escape with the Enterprise lies in playing his games. I've decided to make my move with the field of honour game, and everything depends on my one chance with the ancient duelling pistol. Oh, how fascinating. I'm party to an actual human duel. Quite ready, sir. We shall test each other's courage and then, and then we shall see. As you will, sir. Honour will be served, eh? Oh, wait! As the one challenged, I claim the first shot. It's my game and my rules, but if you need to be persuaded. And now, Captain, how do you have the expression? My fate is in your hands. You've ruined everything! Oh, the remarkable treachery of the species. You've earned my wrath. Go back. Go back to your ship, all of you, and prepare. You're all dead men. You especially, Captain. The prisoner may approach the bench. Any attempt at demonstrations will weigh against you with the court, and this time my instrumentality is unbreakable. Oh, the absurdity of these inferior beings. And now, Captain James Kirk, you stand accused of the high crime of treason against a superior authority, conspiracy, and the attempt to foment insurrection. How do you plead? I warn you. Anything you might say has already been taken down in evidence against you. Irrelevant. Uncalled for. And did you really think that was the only medium of instrumentality at my command? Oh, then you do admit to the charge? Immaterial! Inadmissible! Silence! This trial is over. You are guilty. On all counts, you are guilty. And according to your own laws, this court has no choice in fixing punishment. You will hang by the neck, Captain, until you are dead, dead, dead! Captain's Log, Stardate 2126.3. First Officer Spock reporting. Still no word from Captain Kirk on the surface below us. Waiting time is almost up. I will soon be forced to attempt departure as per instructions. Until a moment ago, I didn't think it possible, but it was. I did it. I was angry. I actually experienced genuine rage. This experiment has been successful. Why, Captain, you're still angry. Would that I could have sustained that moment. Ah, no matter. Do you have a last request? You still haven't learned. You have no choice. Oh, this is becoming quite tiresome. It's all so very easy. Take care, now. The sport? Oh, I'm intrigued. Go ahead, Captain. What do you suggest? Yes! Yes! Oh, then you approve? I know. That will be dull. We'll have to have something more fanciful. Let me see. A hunt. A royal hunt. Predator against predator. Now, you may go hide in the forest anywhere you like and I shall seek. How does that strike you, Captain? The stakes? Always back to your ship. Oh well. If it will add spice to the pursuit, I accept your terms, Captain. Remember, you must try not to let me find you too quickly. At your convenience. KIRK; Enterprise. Enterprise, this is Kirk. Can you hear me? Get the ship away as fast as you can. I'll try and give you the time you need. Can you hear me? Ah-ha! KIRK; Enterprise. Ah ha! Captain Kirk. You must try harder, Captain. This is too easy. Touche, Captain. Touche. I must confess you scored first. But after all, I never played this game before. And now let's have at it again! Ah-ha! Tallyho! You made a noble fight of it, Captain. Yes, but this is such sport. I must fetch all the others back to play. So this is victory. It has a sweet taste. Down, Captain. On your knees! I have. I could run you through! On your knees, Captain! I order you. You've been beaten. I order you! I order you! You broke it! You broke my sword! You dare to defy me! I'll fix you for that! You cheated! You haven't played the game right. I'll show you! No! No. You said I could have this planet. You always stop me when I'm having fun. But I don't want to come in, and I won't. I'm a general, and I won't listen to you. But why? I didn't do anything wrong. I was just playing. But I haven't finished studying my predators yet. Oh, but I was winning. I was winning. No, no. You saw. Oh, but you said I could. You promised. I never have any fun. Oh, but you saw. I was winning. I would have won. Honest. I would have. I would have. I would have. I would. I would. I would. I would."
1625,TOS,episode 17,MOTHER,"Trelane. Time to come in now, Trelane. If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have them at all. You'll grow up, Trelane. You'll understand. Now come along. No, Trelane. You must forgive our child. The fault is ours for indulging him too much. He will be punished. Forgive us, Captain. We will maintain your life-support conditions while you return to your ship. Please accept our apologies."

Why should we? We didn't have anything anyone would want. They poured it on, like, like phasers, only worse, whatever they were using. I tried to signal them. We called up. Tried to surrender. We had women and children. I told them that! I begged them! They wouldn't listen. They didn't let up for a moment. They hit us a full day before you got there, Captain.

Those messages we got, Captain, the one directing us here yesterday. Captain, impulses that direction. Very weak, possibly a survivor. Getting another life reading, Captain. Not survivors. Not warm-blooded. Living creatures, but not human. Azimuth ninety three degrees, range one five seven zero yards. We're hopelessly outnumbered here, Captain. It's those disruptors versus our hand phasers. Sulu is an experienced combat officer. Nor can they at us at the moment. Not unless they moved their original position. That intervening high ground. About one hundred yards in that direction. But after an attack as thorough as this one How is he, Doctor? They're moving. I've got to get to the Captain. Locked on to the enemy, Captain. They're moving toward the high ground. They've locked on to my tricorder. Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload. Any word from the Enterprise? Very clever. As to the reason? You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base. Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations. There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels. However, none has ever been recorded. Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours only. More like space legends. A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain. You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain? I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient. Destruction might be unnecessary. The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim. I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life Very clear, Captain. It would appear someone is curious about us. Computer lock ready, Captain. All systems standing by. Same as the alien, Captain. All systems report normal, Captain. No ascertainable damage. KIRK; Then what is it? We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar system. KIRK; This far out? That's impossible. We are being held. No, sir. An unidentifiable power. Have you tried overload? How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse engines directly. Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature of the force which holds us here? No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic? Electronic? Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in case. I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do. If I could help him, I would. I cannot. He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him. This is the U. S. S. Enterprise calling the Metrons. Our channels are open. Come in, please. We urgently desire a conference. Please answer. But it has happened, Doctor. Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance encrusting that rock. Yes. Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate. Perhaps nothing, Doctor. Perhaps everything. It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that section of the galaxy. Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats. Yes. Fascinating. Good. Good. He knows, Doctor. He has reasoned it out. Yes. Yes. Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder. If he has the time, Doctor. If he has the time. After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost the picture the Metron was sending us. KIRK; You saw what happened down there? Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally happened. I've frequently had my doubts. A thousand years, Captain? Well, that gives us a little time. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Put a stop to this. If there were only some way we could contact him. So? Can that be true? Was Cestus Three an intrusion on their space? Then we could be in the wrong. The Gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves. What is it, Spock? SPOCK; An invention, Doctor. First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal. What's he doing? SPOCK; Diamonds. The hardest known substance. Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles. What force? Can he do it?"

Firing phasers, Captain. The alien has screens up, too. Are you under attack, Captain? We could drop screens. Captain, are you all right? We returned fire with all phaser banks. Negative against its deflector screen. Aye, aye, sir. Arm photon torpedoes. Stand by. No, sir. Doesn't correspond with any configuration we're familiar with. We can't get visual contact. She's too far away. Photon torpedoes locked on, Captain. KIRK; Fire all banks. All banks fired, sir. Clear, Captain, but you Yes, sir. Photon torpedoes negative, Captain. I'm warping out of orbit. Captain, the alien's withdrawing. She's at extreme range, but our sensors indicate she just activated her transporters. Aye, aye, sir. Our screens are down. We can beam you up now, sir. Aye, aye, sir. Captain's log, supplement. We have beamed back to the Enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit of the alien vessel. It appears to be headed toward a largely unexplored section of the galaxy. Sulu here, sir. Affirmative, sir. Affirmative, sir. They must be aware we're after them, sir. They've gone to warp six also. Aye, aye, sir. Alien ship maintaining interval, Captain. Now at warp seven. Aye, aye, sir. Captain. Closing on target, sir. Yes, sir. We're closing, sir. Captain! The alien. It's slowing down. Warp five, four, two. It's going sublight, sir. Sir? It's stopped dead in space. No, sir. They're just dead out there. Yes, sir. Unmoving. Range is one eight one zero. One seven six zero. Range is one seven zero zero. One six four zero. Range is one five nine zero. One five five zero and closing, sir. Warp six, warp five, four, warp three, warp one. Sublight, Captain. We're stuck, Captain. It's impossible, but. It's impossible. He's gone. Captain. It's impossible, but there's Sirius over there when it should be here. And Canopus. And Arcanis. We're.

We'll beam down immediately, Commodore. Kirk out. This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of now here. He probably wants additional advice. Energise. Kirk to Enterprise. Red alert. Cestus Three has been destroyed. Full alert. Tricorder readings, Mister Spock. Life detection. Faked. All this happened several days ago. Lang, over there. Look for survivors. Kelowitz, that way. O'Herlihy, stick with me. Come on, Bones. Captain's log, Stardate 3045.6 The Enterprise has responded to a call from Earth observation outpost on Cestus Three. On landing, we have discovered that the outpost has been destroyed. Keep him alive, Bones. I want to know what's been happening here. Survivors? Where? O'Herlihy. Cover! Kirk to Enterprise, lock on transporters. Beam us up. Keep those screens up. Fire all phasers. Take all action necessary to protect the ship. We'll hold out here. Keep those screens up. Worry about us when the ship is safe. Kirk out. If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll be open to phaser attack. We're stuck with it, Mister Spock. We'll have to make do with what we've got. Kelowitz, Lang, flank out. Lay down fire on co-ordinates Mister Spock gave you. Even if you don't see them. Keep your heads down. We're helpless down here. And the Enterprise It's my ship, Mister Spock. I should be there. We can't even get at them. Can you remember the layout of this place? The arsenal? I'll risk it. Kirk here. Report. Never mind about me. What about the ship? Arm your photon torpedoes. Any identification on the attacking vessel? Sulu. Sulu, our communications are being interfered with. Now get this straight. You do anything you think necessary to protect the ship. Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything. Clear? Never mind about me. Protect my ship! Good. Contact me when you can. Kirk out. We'll see how ingenious they are. Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher. Lang! Sulu's taken her out of orbit. Did you see them? An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz. Where do you think they are? It'll be a lot closer to them. Stand clear. Kirk here. Lock on to the alien, Mister Sulu. I don't want to lose her. I want a search party of thirty medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors. Notify the transporter room. Lock onto us. We're beaming up. Can you tell me what happened? Yes, I know. Easy. Easy. Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus Three. One for the Enterprise to go there, and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface. It was a trap. Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus Three, getting us and our whole crew to come ashore. The reason is crystal clear. The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation. Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open. I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three. How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mister Spock. The threat is clear and immediate. Invasion. I intend to. If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us. Captain to helmsman. Is the alien still making warp five? Initiate warp six. Overtake. Phaser banks, lock on to the enemy vessel. Stand by for firing orders. All hands, this is the Captain. We are going into battle. All hands, battle stations. Red alert. I repeat, red alert. This is no drill. This is no drill. Captain's log, Stardate 3046.2. We are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus Three. Mister DePaul. Position. All scanners lock into computer banks. I want a complete record of this. Mister Spock, what do we have on this general area? Anything on intelligent life forms? Mister Sulu, status, alien vessel. Warp factor seven. Something the matter, Mister Spock? Thank you, Mister Spock. I mean to catch them. They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock? Of course. Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock. If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations. There's no time for that. It's a matter of policy. Out here, we're the only policemen around. And a crime has been committed. Do I make myself clear? I'm delighted, Mister Spock. Report, Mister Sulu. Warp factor eight. Captain to phaser banks. All components at battle ready. All banks primed. Yes, Mister Sulu. Good. Mister DePaul. Our position. Is it on the alien's course? By the alien ship? Any interference? Resistance? Mister Spock? Mister Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system? Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams? Yes, what is it? He may be turning to fight. Are you sure? Then we've got them. Go to Red Alert. Prepare to fire phaser banks. Sensors, lock on. Mister Sulu, continue closing. Mister Spock, lock phasers into computer. Computers will control attack. From warp eight? Have you lost your mind? Mister Scott, report. Phaser banks. Report. Damage Control, report. Tractor beam? This is Kirk. I don't understand. What makes you think you can interfere with Just a minute The Enterprise is dead in space, stopped cold during her pursuit of an alien raider by mysterious forces, and I have been somehow whisked off the bridge and placed on the surface of an asteroid, facing the Captain of the alien ship. Weaponless, I face the creature the Metrons called a Gorn. Large, reptilian. Like most humans, I seem to have an instinctive revulsion to reptiles. I must fight to remember that this is an intelligent, highly advanced individual, the Captain of a starship, like myself, undoubtedly a dangerously clever opponent. This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Who ever finds this please get it to Starfleet Command. I'm engaged in personal combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn. He's immensely strong. Already he has withstood attacks from me that would have killed a human being. Fortunately, though strong, he is not agile. The agility and, I hope, the cleverness, is mine. The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons. There's very little here. Scrub brush, rocks, an abundance of mineral deposits, but no weapons in the conventional sense. Still, I need to find one. Bare-handed against the Gorn, I have no chance. A large deposit of diamonds on the surface. Perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe. Beautifully crystallized and pointed, but too small to be useful as a weapon. An incredible fortune in stones yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser, or a good solid club. Yet the Metrons said there would be weapons, if I could find them. Where? What kind? This may be my last entry. I am almost exhausted. Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned I have very little time left. Native sulphur, diamonds. This place is a mineralogist's dream. Yet there is something about sulphur. Something very old. Something? If only I could remember. Who is this, the Metron? All right. What do you want? Like you were at Cestus Three? You butchered helpless human beings No. No, I won't kill you. Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost. No, I won't kill him! Do you hear? You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else! You're a Metron? You seem more like a boy. How? What happened to the Gorn? No. That won't be necessary. We can talk. Maybe reach an agreement. I don't know. I don't know. All right, everybody. Back to your posts. Let's get out of here. Mister Sulu. Don't try and figure it out, Mister Sulu. Just plot a course for us back to Cestus Three. We're a most promising species, Mister Spock, as predators go. Did you know that? I don't. Not anymore. And maybe in a thousand years or so, we'll be able to prove it. Never mind, Mister Spock. It doesn't make much sense to me either. Take us back to where we're supposed to be, Mister Sulu. Warp factor one."

Captain James Kirk. We have prepared a planet with a suitable atmosphere. You will be taken there, as will the Captain of the Gorn ship which you have been pursuing. There you will settle your dispute. You will be provided with a recording-translating device, in hopes that a chronicle of this contest will serve to dissuade others of your kind from entering our system, but you will not be permitted to communicate with your ship. You will each be totally alone. It is you who are interfering. We are simply putting a stop to it. The place we have prepared for you contains sufficient elements for either of you to construct weapons lethal enough to destroy the other, which seems to be your intention. The winner of the contest will be permitted to go his way unharmed. The loser, along with his ship, shall be destroyed in the interests of peace. The contest will be one of ingenuity against ingenuity, brute strength against brute strength. The results will be final. There will be no discussion. It is done. We are the Metrons. Your Captain is losing his battle. We would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements, if any, which are customary in your culture. We believe you have very little time left. Your violent intent and actions demonstrate that you are not civilised. However, we are not without compassion. It is possible you may have feelings toward your Captain. So that you will be able to prepare yourself, we will allow you to see and hear what is now transpiring. Does my appearance surprise you, Captain? I am approximately fifteen hundred of your Earth years old. You surprise me, Captain. By sparing your helpless enemy who surely would have destroyed you, you demonstrated the advanced trait of mercy, something we hardly expected. We feel there may be hope for your kind. Therefore, you will not be destroyed. It would not be civilised. Very good, Captain. There is hope for you. Perhaps in several thousand years, your people and mine shall meet to reach an agreement.

Are you all right, Lieutenant? Mister Scott is still with us. Captain? Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries. Engineering reports warp engines non-operational. Mister Scott overrode the automatic helm setting and is holding us in orbit on impulse power. Earth, Captain. We were on a general course in this direction when we were pulled in by the star. Apparently the breakaway threw us on in the same direction. We are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit, Captain. Engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape velocity. Apparently, Captain, so are we. Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain. Backward. Exact chronometer readings in a few moments. Verified. Scanners report some type of craft approaching from below us. Under cloud cover and closing. Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor, equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads. If he hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our capacity to repair under current circumstances. Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile to take our tractor beam. Aircraft is breaking up, Captain. KIRK; Transporter room. Can you lock onto the cockpit of that aircraft? Bridge to Captain Kirk. The aircraft has completely broken up, Captain. Shall we turn off the tractor beam? Neither have I. Captain. We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again as a UFO. And Mister Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines. Captain Christopher. We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man's future? Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations. and in so doing, change what must be. And if it is changed, Captain, you and I and all that we know might not even exist. Yes, sir. {Captain's quarters]KIRK I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a Starbase. It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle. We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance. Cygnet Fourteen is a planet dominated by women. They seemed to feel the ship's computer system lacked a personality. They gave it one. Female, of course. I have run a computer check on all historical tapes. They show no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher. Bridge to Captain Kirk. Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher. Important I see you both immediately. Yes, sir. Bridge out. Crude methods, but effective. I made an error in my computations. I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after all. Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I find, after running a crosscheck on that factor, that your son Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant The doctor is correct. Unless we return Captain Christopher to Earth, There will be no Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher to go to Saturn. Acknowledging that we must return Captain Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the explanation of his return. We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it. It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska. And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter. Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane. It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine UFO. Possibly alien, definitely destructive. A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us. Logically, it could work. Also, logically, there are a hundred variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're in now. Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a UFO. Fifteen minutes, twenty eight seconds. It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more time-consuming than a direct approach. In our case I am. You may be correct, Doctor. Open communicator channel. Beam up immediately. We'll know in a moment, Doctor. Spock here. Are you all right, Captain? I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain. Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is. Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mister Sulu. Spock here. Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory. Poor photography. I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain Christopher to the briefing room. Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms? I can't do that, Captain. Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me. The captain will provide the co-ordinates for the transporter chief. One for you, one for me. Set them on heavy stun force. In fact, I do. But only to a certain point. Energise. Don't you find that painful, Captain? He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the base. It was necessary to bring him along. I suspected he might not wish to return with us. Mister Scott and I both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect, like the one that put us here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash will propel us into another time warp. Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened. Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of time passage will now increase. Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We've broken free and heading back. Chronometers moving forward again, Captain. Computed. Twenty minutes, sir. It'll be close. Ten minutes. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Approaching second beaming, Captain. Now. Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin now. Fifty years to go. Forty, thirty."

Maybe he could be retrained, reeducated. If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave. It's just a joke, Captain. Oh? This could be an historic occasion. You mean yet. How long have they been down there now? Well, shouldn't they be coming up? Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mister Spock? It's been too long. Jim should have at least signaled by now. Only one signal. What happened? Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock. What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one. If something went wrong"

If this one's like those, it'll make the devil's noise if you start it. I didn't hear anything. The emergency signal. Five thirty in that time zone, maybe a little after. Yes, sir. Shall I issue phasers? Yes, sir. Mister Spock ran them through. They were the right ones. We got them all. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Captain's Log, Stardate 3114.1. We must make an attempt to break free of this time, or we and our reluctant passengers will remain its prisoners. All we have is a theory and a few facts. Warp factor three, sir. Sir, our speed is increasing. We're travelling at over warp eight. It's maximum now, sir. She's fighting it. Gaining speed now, Captain. We're now at warp four, warp seven. Eight. Off the dial, sir. Past Pluto, sir. Engines cutting back, sir. No decrease in speed. The engines!"

We could re-energise in about four hours, but Well sir, as I say, the engines are being repaired, but we've no place to go in this time. If you, if you see what I mean? Sir? Engine room to Mister Spock. We've completed re-energising the warp engines, sir. We can re-fire them anytime. Aye, sir. Engine room out. Oh, we'll do that all right, Captain. We'll not be getting so close that my engines couldn't pull us out. What I am worried about, sir, that we may not have much control when we're thrown forward again. Braking control, sir. If I can't stop us soon enough, we may overshoot our time, and if I stop the engines suddenly the strain may tear us apart. Anyway we do it, it's a mighty rough ride. Pulling away from the sun weakened them, sir. They may blow apart if I reverse. Aye, sir. Engine room to Bridge. Engines are on full reverse. They're buckling! Bridge!"
1810,TOS,episode 19,KIRK,"Mister Spock. Auxiliaries? This is the Captain. Damage control parties on all decks, check in. All departments tie in with the record computer. Report casualties and operational readiness to the First Officer. Kirk out. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Control. I want them alerted to the position of that black star that's in the area of Starbase 9. Orbit where? Screen on. Give us some altitude, Mister Sulu. Put it on audio. Manned Moon shot? That was in the late 1960s. What? Mister Sulu, can you gain altitude faster? I want to outdistance him. Scotty, activate tractor beam. Lock onto that aircraft and hold it out there. Try and beam that pilot aboard. Take over, Mister Spock. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. That's right. You can step off the transporter Relax, Captain, you're among friends. I'm Captain James T. Kirk. All in good time, Captain. Meanwhile, let me apologise for bringing you aboard the ship so abruptly, but it couldn't be helped. I didn't know that your craft couldn't stand up to our tractor beam. We'll tell you what we decide to tell you in a few moments. In the meantime, relax. You're our guest. I have a feeling you'll find it interesting. Kirk here. What is it, Mister Spock? Affirmative. We have the pilot aboard. I'll be right up. Kirk out. Follow me. Morning. Captain. Crewman. Bridge. There are only twelve like it in the fleet. We're a combined service, Captain. Our authority is the United Earth Space Probe Agency. This is very difficult to explain. We're from your future. A time warp placed us here. It was an accident. Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer, Lieutenant Commander Spock. Feel free to look around, Captain. Don't touch anything, but I think you'll find it interesting. Very well, Mister Spock. Anything else on your mind? What about him? Your logic can be most annoying. That flight suit must be uncomfortable. Why don't you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable? Then I want to meet you and him in my quarters. Come. Captain's log, supplemental. Engineering Officer Scott informs warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and reenergised. Computer, you will not address me in that manner. Compute. Mister Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired. I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate. I'm afraid you'll have to. We can't send you back. It's not the transporter. It's you. You know what the future looks like. If anybody else finds out, they could change the course of it, destroy it. I'd report, If I could. We can't take the risk. I'm sorry. Kirk here. What is it, Scotty? But what, Scotty? Yes, Scotty. Carry on. Maintenance note. My recording computer has a serious malfunction. Recommend it either be corrected or scrapped. Compute. Kirk here. Yes, Mister Spock. Report to my quarters. I'll contact Captain Christopher. Captain Christopher. Captain Christopher? Security, this is the Captain. He tried to escape. I know how he feels, but I can't send him back with what he knows. Yes. But we're not in that position yet. And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong. We're roughly about the same age, but in our society he'd be useless. Archaic. Now you're sounding like Spock. Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children? You all right? You said you had some additional information, Mister Spock? Well, that's it, isn't it? We'll have to find some way of That means those search parties will be crawling all over that wreckage. If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sun dogs, explainable things. At least publicly. What about our problem, Mister Spock? Any ideas on how to get us back to our own time? We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos. If the Captain feels duty bound to report what he saw, there won't be any evidence to support him. Perhaps. No, Captain. Thank you, but if anything should go wrong, you might get hurt. We couldn't risk that. Neither could you or your son. Primitive computer. I've seen them demonstrated in museums. I don't intend to start it. What was what? Kirk to Enterprise. Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we have another problem. Captain 's Log, Stardate 3113.9. First Officer Spock recording. Due to an unfortunate accident, we have taken aboard another unwanted passenger. Your surprise package is an Air Police sergeant from the base. I want you to keep him in the transporter room. No sense in letting him see more of the ship than is necessary. Kirk out. What was the chronometer reading when we first sighted Christopher's jet? Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? Get them all. We'll try the darkroom. Yes, that's it. That's all of them. Signal Mister Spock that we're almost ready to beam up. I'll make a check of the files just in case. What other one? No, no, no. Just me. Besides, could anyone get out of here without your seeing them? Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me. I popped in out of thin air. No, Colonel. I know it's no game. For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk. I told you, you wouldn't believe me. Colonel, would you mind being careful with that? Of some kind. If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one. A big one. This little thing? Just something I slipped on. Did I sabotage something? Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all. That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered. All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri. A beautiful place. You ought to see it. That ought to be just about right. Yes, I do. What's he doing here? I see. No harm done. Mister Sulu, did you check out those tapes? All they have is a mystery and no answers. Mister Sulu, signal the Transporter Chief. Four to beam up. Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake. You can't explain your presence on the base. You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way. Four to beam up, Mister Sulu. You won't have anything to remember, because it never would have happened. Helm control? Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance. Especially if one is all you have. Assume your stations. Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. Take a good look around, Captain. You made it here ahead of all of them. Mister Spock. Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain Christopher, you only have about fifteen years, so you'd better hurry. Now, Mister Sulu. More power, Mister Sulu. Do you have the chronometer reading and the co-ordinates to return Captain Christopher and the guard? Bridge to transporter room. Captain Christopher. {Transporter room]CHRISTOPHER We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain. Are you ready? Our pleasure, Captain. Bridge out. Bridge to transporter room. Prepare to energise. Energise. Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energise. Energise. What's our reading, Mister Spock? Bridge to engineering. Begin full braking power. No choice, Mister Scott. Never mind, Mister Spock. Mister Scott is still with us. Open a channel, Uhura. Starfleet Control, this is the Enterprise. Captain Kirk speaking. Starfleet Control, repeating message. The Enterprise is home.

We may have a real on our hands. Captain 's log Stardate 3113.2. We were en-route to Starbase 9 for resupply when a black star of high gravitational attraction began to drag us toward it. It required all warp power in reverse to pull us away from the star. But, like snapping a rubber band, the breakaway sent us plunging through space, out of control, to stop here, wherever we are."

Two cylindrical projections on top, one below. Purpose undetermined. I won't be here. The UFO's climbing away fast. Acknowledged. Closing on target. You speak English. Captain John Christopher, United States Air Force. Serial number 4857932. What's going on here? Where am I? What happened? You people, who are you? Don't give me any double-talk. Just tell me who you are. A woman? Must have taken quite a lot to build a ship like this. I see. Did the Navy United Earth? You seem to have a lot of them. However, I can't deny the fact that you're here. With this ship. I never have believed in little green men. Interesting is a word and a half for it, Captain. I take it that a lady computer is not routine. Well, you people certainly have interesting problems. I'd love to stay around to see how your girlfriend works out, but  Can't? Spock here told me that your transporter can beam down an object even from an orbit this high. Well then my disappearance would change something, too. Look, Captain, I don't buy all your time accident story. The experts can figure out who you are and what you are. It's my duty to report what I've seen. Well, what would you do? I don't want to know about risks. I have a wife, two children. What about them? Too bad, Captain. Maybe I can't go home, but neither can you. You're as much a prisoner in time as I am. Captain's Log Stardate 3113.7. Our engines are being repaired, but we are still locked in time, and we have aboard a passenger whom we do not want, and we cannot return. All right. Nice and easy. Now I'm going to step into that thing, and you're going to transport me back to Earth. The answer to that is no. Yeah. I see physical training is required in your service, too. What does he mean by that? Why? You said I made no relative contribution. Wait a minute. I don't have a son. A boy. I'm going to have a son. When I made visual contact, I turned on my wing cameras. I got close enough to take some pretty clear pictures of you. Air Defence Command will be processing that film fast. And Control was probably recording my radio transmissions. That makes me out to be either a liar or a fool. Captain, I know that base. I was stationed there a year ago. I'd like to Well, I'd like to help. I could sketch a layout of the place for you. Show you where the record section and the photo lab are. He's probably being held in security section. Even if they've notified the authorities, it'll take a little time for someone to get there. Yes, but you're not going to get them unless you take me with you. Something's already gone wrong. Of course, you could beam down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him. You don't trust me, Spock. They know you've been here. Uh-uh. Not me. You bet I do. My family. A son that isn't born yet. You don't have to return me now, Captain. Spock, come out of there. I told you it's my duty to report everything I've seen. That's explanation enough. Spock! Over my dead body. Slingshot effects are fine for you people. How do you propose to return the Sergeant and me? What if you can't pull free of the sun? I never thought I'd make it into space. I was in line to be chosen for the space programme but I didn't qualify. Everything A-OK. Captain, thanks for the look ahead. Blackjack, this is Bluejay Four. I could have sworn there was some kind of ship, but nothing could have moved that fast. Mark it down as another UFO. Bluejay Four returning to base. Out."

1948,TOS,episode 19,FELLINI,"Photo lab. All right. Where's the other one? Your partner. I saw you looking that was and I saw somebody move in there. No. Nobody should have been able to. Now, look, Mister. You and I had better start communicating. I want to know how you got in here. That's a simple question. Give me a simple answer. Nobody saw you. You got all the way inside without tripping any alarm. How did you do it? Don't try to be funny. How did you get in? You seem to think this is some kind of a game. All right. What did you say your name was? And how did you get inside a top security installation, James T. Kirk? That worries you a little bit, huh? What is that, a radio? Transmitter of some kind? You can be more specific than that, Kirk. I don't like mysteries. I'll have it disassembled and examined. We are not dummies, mister. We know how to find out things we want to know. What is that? Is that a uniform of some kind? Kirk, maybe you don't realise how serious this is. Sabotage of a government installation No. We stopped you in time. But what would you have done if we hadn't found you? Is that what you're here for? Nothing at all? All right, Kirk. Maybe this will make you laugh. Sabotage, espionage, unauthorised entry, burglary. How are those for starters? And I can think up lots more if you don't start talking. I am going to lock you up for two hundred years. See what that is, airman."

I merely state that it is wrong. I know the Captain. He is in Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian. Vulcanians do not speculate. I speak from pure logic. If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen. Gentlemen, human beings have characteristics just as inanimate objects do. It is impossible for Captain Kirk to act out of panic or malice. It is not his nature. Yes. In my opinion. Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain. Attention, Commander Finney, report to pod for reading on ion plates. Officer posted, Captain. Acknowledged. Captain. I've run a complete megalyte survey on the computer. You sound bitter, Captain. Further instructions? Chess. Explain. That is true. Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game. Observe for yourself. Rook to king's pawn four. Now, this is the computer's move. And now mine. Checkmate. Mechanically, the computer's flawless. Therefore, logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible. I could not accept that, however. Exactly. I programmed it myself for chess some months ago. The best I should have been able to attain was a draw. Transporter room, stand by. We're beaming down. Five in all. Affirmative. I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, either accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer. Affirmative. The Captain, myself, and the records officer. Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was Lieutenant Commander Finney. Affirmative, Captain. B deck, in or near Engineering. Acknowledged.  Compensate. Decaying, Captain.

And you?  All of my old friends look like doctors. All of his look like you. Well, you might as well join me for a drink. With this inquiry coming up, he's going to need all the friends he can get. I know something about it. It's possible. He could have. No. Wait a minute. I don't quite follow you. Well, yes, I suppose it could happen. Not Captain Kirk. But he's not that kind of a man. Yes. It's possible. Well, I had to see it to believe it. They're about to lop off the captain's professional head, and you're sitting here playing chess with the computer. Mister Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known. That's impossible. So you tested the programme bank. Well, why are you just sitting there? First, the Captain. Mister Spock. And lastly, myself. Indeed she is. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

1977,TOS,episode 20,KIRK,"No. But the death of the crewman. Kirk to Enterprise. Where's Mister Spock with that computer log extract? Kirk out.  I agree. I waited until the last possible moment. We were on Red Alert. The storm got worse. I had to jettison the pod. What took you so long, Mister Spock? Jamie. That's not so. He was my friend. You have my sworn deposition.  Timothy, I haven't seen you since the Vulcanian expedition. Well, I see our graduating class from the Academy is well represented. Corrigan. Teller. How you doing, Mike? Couple of days. In a hurry to see me go? You can talk plainer than that. Go on. Finish. Ben was a friend of yours, and Go on. I'm waiting to hear the rest. What would be the point? You've already made up your minds. Excuse me, Bones. Ready. Yes. He was an instructor at the Academy when I was a midshipman, but that didn't stand in the way of our beginning a close friendship. His daughter Jamie, who was here last night, was named after me. It's no secret. We were assigned to the same ship some years later. I relieved him on watch once and found a circuit open to the atomic matter piles that should've been closed. Another five minutes, it could have blown up the ship. United Starship Republic, number 1371. I closed the switch and logged the incident. He drew a reprimand and was sent to the bottom of the promotion list. Yes. He had been at the Academy for an unusually long time as an instructor. As a result, he was late in being assigned to a starship. The delay, he felt, looked bad on his record. My action, he believed, made things worse. Weather scan indicated an ion storm dead ahead. I sent Finney into the pod.  His name was at the top of the duty roster. He may have blamed me that he never rose to command a ship, but I don't assign jobs on the basis of who blames me. It was Finney's turn, and I assigned him. He had just checked in with me from the pod when we hit the leading edge of the storm. Not too bad at first. I signalled a Yellow Alert. Then we began encountering pressure, variant stress, force seven, the works. I finally signaled a Red Alert. Finney knew he had a matter of seconds. I gave him those seconds and more. But apparently it wasn't enough. I don't know. There's been a mistake. Mister Spock is running a survey right now, but the odds are next to impossible. Is that the way you see it? A physical breakdown. Possibly even mental collapse. I'd be admitting a man died because But if what you suspect is true, then I'm guilty. I should be punished. By what, Commodore Stone? That's as far as you go, sir. I'm telling you I was there on the Bridge. I know what happened. I know what I did. So that's the way we do it now? Sweep it under the rug, and me along with it? Not on your life. I intend to fight. Draw it? I demand it. And right now, Commodore Stone. Right now. Captain's Log, Stardate 2948.9. The officers who will comprise my court-martial board are proceeding to Starbase Eleven. Meanwhile, repairs on the Enterprise are almost complete. Areel. Doctor McCoy said you were here. I should have felt it in the air, like static electricity. You look marvellous. You haven't changed a bit. Oh, you've heard about that, have you? I remember. Let's forget it. We have a lot of lost time to make up for. The confidence of an innocent man. Look, Let's not talk shop. I never could talk you into anything. All right. Fire away. What other choice is there? You, perhaps? Well, a girl with your ability should be able to handle two cases at once. You still haven't made any recommendation. Areel, you still haven't told me how you know so much about what the prosecution's going to do. Yes. What is all this? I hope I'm not crowding you. Oh, I like them fine, but a computer takes less space. Why not?  And what would be the point? You have to be either an obsessive crackpot who's escaped from his keeper or Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law. I'm afraid so. I have no objections, sir. I do, sir. Not guilty. Yes, sir, there was.  Firstly, I am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log. We were in an ion storm. Everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved. I was in command. The decisions were mine, no one else's. Charges of malice have been raised. There was no malice. Lieutenant Commander Finney was a member of my crew, and that's exactly the way he was treated. It has been suggested that I panicked on the bridge and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely. That is not so. You've heard some of the details of my record. This was not my first crisis. It was one of many. During it, I did what my experience and training required me to do. I took the proper steps in the proper order. I did exactly what had to be done, exactly when it should have been done. Given the same circumstances I would do the same thing without hesitation, because the steps I took in the order I took them were absolutely necessary if I were to save my ship. And nothing is more important than my ship. We'll need somebody in the pod for readings. Post him. Stand by on alert status, Mister Spock. Warp factor one, Mister Hanson. Tie in. Make it fast, Ben. I may have to go to Red Alert. Hold our course, Mister Hanson. Engineering, then ion pod. One third more thrust. Stand by to get out of there, Ben. Steady as she goes, Mister Hanson. But that's not the way it happened. Captain's Log, Stardate 2949.9. The evidence presented by the visual playback to my general court-martial was damning. I suspect even my attorney has begun to doubt me. Are you suggesting that I did? Two days ago, I would've staked anything on my judgment. I spent my whole life training for decisions just like that one. My whole life. Is it possible that when the moment came? No. I know what I did. You can pull out if you want to. Kirk here. I'll tell you what you found. Nothing, right? Not bitter enough to forget to thank you for your efforts. No. It's not all bad, Mister Spock. Who knows. You may be able to beat your next captain at chess. Kirk out. Jamie. This is Lieutenant Commander Finney's daughter. It's too late for that, Jamie, but I'm glad you don't blame me anymore for what happened. Don't say any more. I know, and I thank you. I have to go and change. You ready? I instituted a phase one search. It's a painstaking, thorough attempt in and around the ship to find a man who's presumably injured and unable to respond. I beg your pardon? Yes. Possibly. Gentlemen, for the purposes of this experiment, it'll be necessary for all personnel, except for members of the court and the command crew, to leave the ship. I am ordering all others to report to the transporter room. Our impulse engines have been shut down. We'll maintain orbit by momentum. We hope to be finished long before that. Ready, Mister Spock? Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster, we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power. The computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship. Doctor McCoy? All right, Mister Spock. Turn it down a little. Gentlemen, that sound is caused by the heartbeats of all the people on board the ship. Doctor McCoy will use this white sound device to mask out each person's heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing. That's all of us, except for crewman in the transporter room. Mister Spock, eliminate his heartbeat. That accounts for everyone. Seal off B deck, sections 18Y through 23D. It would seem so. Commodore, this is my problem. I'd appreciate it if no one left the bridge. Sam Cogley had gone a shore to bring Jamie Finney on board. We felt Jamie's presence would make Finney easier to handle in the event Finney really were alive. Ben. Ben Finney. Ben, where are you? I'm glad you're alive. Ben! Ben, it's not too late. We can help you. Put the phaser down, Ben. What about my ship? Mister Spock, what's our orbit status? Ben. Why kill innocent people? I logged the mistake, Ben. Blame me, not them. It's not too late. You can be helped. But if you kill those people Is Jamie included in that deal? She's on board by now. Yes. She's on board. Beaten and sobbing, Finney told me where he had sabotaged the prime energy circuits. The damage he'd caused was considerable, but not irreparable. With luck, I would be able to effect repairs before our orbit decayed completely. At the risk of sounding like a mystic, that depends on the stars. I didn't have much of a chance to thank him. I wouldn't be a bit surprised. Let's try. See? No change. Discipline goes on. Goodbye, Areel. Better luck next time. She's a very good lawyer."

Four years, seven months, and an odd number of days. Not that I'm counting. But things have changed for you, haven't they? I'm a lawyer in the Judge Advocate's office, remember? You're taking it very lightly. Are you? That's not what the rumours indicate. Jim, this could ruin you. Will you take some advice? The prosecution will build its case on the basis of Kirk versus the computer. Now if your attorney tries to defend on that basis, you won't have a chance. That's up to your attorney, and that's why he's got to be a good one. No, I'm busy. Jim, be serious. You're not an ordinary human. You're a Starship Captain, and you've stepped into scandal. If there's any way they can do it, they'll slap you down hard and permanently for the good of the service. Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law. If anyone can save you, he can. He'll be paying you a visit. Jim, I've got to go. Because, Jim Kirk, my dear old love, I am the prosecution, and I have to do my very best to have you slapped down hard. Broken out of the service, in disgrace. I call Mister Spock. Mister Spock, as a First officer, you know a great deal about computers, don't you? It is possible for a computer to malfunction, is it not? Do you know of any malfunction which has caused an inaccuracy in the Enterprise computer? That answer is based on your mechanical survey of the Enterprise computer ordered by the defendant prior to this trial, is it not? Now the stardate Why do you say that? In other words, it reports that Captain Kirk was reacting to an extreme emergency that did not then exist. Is it? Were you watching him the exact moment he pressed the jettison button? Then how can you dispute the finding of the log? Oh? On what do you base that statement? Please instruct the witness not to speculate. I do not see what that has to In your opinion. Thank you. Your witness, Mister Cogley. I now call the personnel officer for the Enterprise. In the course of your duties as personnel officer of the Enterprise, you would be familiar with the service records of all aboard? With reference to Records Officer Finney, was there in his service record a reported disciplinary action for failure to close a circuit? Was the charge in that instance based upon a log entry by the officer who relieved him? And who was that officer? Louder, please, for the court. Now the Captain Kirk who sits in this courtroom? Thank you. Do you wish to cross-examine, Mister Cogley? I now call Doctor McCoy to the stand. Doctor, you are, on the record, an expert in psychology, especially space psychology. Patterns which develop in the close quarters of a ship during long voyages in deep space. You have just heard the testimony of your own personnel officer, that it was an action of the then Ensign Kirk, which placed an unerasable blot on the record of the then Lieutenant Finney. Psychologically, Doctor, is it possible that Lieutenant Finney blamed Kirk for the incident? He could have hated Kirk down through the years, blamed him for being passed over for promotion, blamed him for never being given a command of his own, correct? Now, let us hypothesise, Doctor. Is it normal for a person to return affection for hatred? Do we not tend to at first resent and then actively dislike the person who hates us? Hypothetically. Would not Captain Smith begin to hate Lieutenant Commander Jones once he learned that Lieutenant Commander Jones hated and detested him? Then I ask you, is it not possible that Captain Kirk became aware of Lieutenant Commander Finney's hatred toward him and perhaps, even involuntarily, began to reciprocate? Any normal human, Doctor. Is it possible? Is it theoretically possible, Doctor? Thank you. Your witness, Mister Cogley. May it please the court. The prosecution concedes the inestimable record of Captain Kirk. Thank you. The prosecution does not wish to dishonour this man, but facts are facts. I must invite the attention of the court and Captain Kirk to this visual extract from the Enterprise computer log. Play back. What you are about to see is precisely what took place on the Enterprise bridge during the ion storm. Reverse. Stop. Go forward with magnification on the panel. Freeze that. Captain Kirk is now signalling a Yellow Alert. Go forward, normal view. Freeze that! If the court will notice, the log plainly shows the defendant's finger pressing the jettison button. The condition signal reads Yellow Alert. Not red alert, but simply Yellow Alert. When the pod containing Lieutenant Commander Finney was jettisoned, the emergency did not as yet exist. Sir, the prosecution rests. Objection! Counsel for the defence has rested his case. Mister Cogley is well-known for his theatrics. Your Honour, that is ridiculous. We produced the witnesses in court. My learned opponent had the opportunity to see them, cross-examine them. I protest, Your Honour. Object! The witness would be making a conclusion. What does that mean? Absolutely no objection, sir. How long will it be this time before I see you again? Sam Cogley asked me to give you something special. It's not a first edition, just a book. Sam says that makes it special. He's busy on a case. He's defending Ben Finney. He says he'll win. Do you think it would cause a complete breakdown of discipline if a lowly lieutenant kissed a Starship Captain on the bridge of his ship? And so must the Enterprise. Goodbye, Jim. I had pretty good luck this time. I lost, didn't l?"
2117,TOS,episode 20,STONE,"Maintenance Section Eighteen. The section is working on the Intrepid. Reschedule. The Enterprise is on priority one. That makes three times you've read it, Jim. Is there an error? Regulations, Captain. And the extract from your ship's computer log confirming this sworn deposition? It's a great pity. The service can't afford to lose men like Lieutenant Commander Finney. I'll take that. Mister Spock, would you please? Captain Kirk, you say you jettisoned the pod after the Red Alert? Then, Captain, I must presume you've committed willful perjury. This extract from your computer log says you jettisoned the pod before going to Red Alert. Consider yourself confined to the base. Official inquiry will determine whether a general court martial is in order. Captain's Log, Stardate 2948.5. Starship Enterprise remains in orbit around Starbase Eleven. Full repairs in progress. I've been ordered to stand by on Starbase Eleven until the inquiry into the death of Lieutenant Commander Finney can be conducted. I'm confident of the outcome. This inquiry, to determine whether a general court-martial should be convened against Captain Kirk on charges of perjury and culpable negligence. Let us begin with your relationship with Commander Finney. You knew him for a long time, didn't you?  It's common knowledge that something happened to your friendship. Continue.  And he blamed you for that? Comment. Service record of Lieutenant Commander Finney to be appended this inquiry. Now let's get into the specifics of the storm, Captain. Why Finney? If he blamed you Then why, Captain, does the computer log from your ship, made automatically at the time, indicate that you were still on Yellow Alert when you jettisoned and not on Red? It would seem so. Could the computer be wrong? Stop recording. Now, look, Jim. Not one man in a million could do what you and I have done. Command a starship. A hundred decisions a day, hundreds of lives staked on you making every one of them right. You're played out, Jim. Exhausted. That's the way my report'll read if you co-operate. Possibly. Admit nothing. Say nothing. Let me bury the matter here and now. No starship captain has ever stood trial before, and I don't want you to be the first. I'm thinking of the service. I won't have it smeared. All right. By an evident perjurer who's either covering his bad judgment, his cowardice, or It's in the transcript, and computer transcripts don't lie. I'm telling you, Captain, either you accept a permanent ground assignment, or the whole disciplinary weight of Starfleet command is going to light right on your neck. Then you draw a general court. This court is now in session. I have appointed as members of this court Space Command Representative Lindstrom, Starship Captains Krasnovsky and Chandra. Captain Kirk, I direct your attention to the fact that you have a right to ask for substitute officers if you feel that any of these named harbour any prejudiced attitudes to your case. Do you consent to the service Lieutenant Shaw as prosecuting officer and to myself as president of the court? All right, clerk. Proceed, Lieutenant. You may step down. You may step down. You may step down. Mister Cogley. You've listened to testimony from three witnesses, and in neither instance have you availed yourself of your right to cross-examine. Have you abrogated that right? Court recognises counsel for the prosecution. Mister Cogley? Continue. Court is now in session. The board will entertain motions before delivering its verdict. Counsel for the prosecution? Counsel for the defence? Mister Cogley. Mister Cogley! Of what nature is this evidence? Counsels will kindly direct their remarks to the bench. Sustained. Mister Cogley, we are waiting for proof of the extraordinary statement you made in the briefing room. This court is by no means adjourned, Mister Cogley. Very well. Captain, are you maintaining an engine crew aboard? Finney. KIRK; Localise that. So Finney is alive. The orbit is beginning to decay. Mister Spock, the court has not yet reached a verdict. We will hear this witness out. Unless the prosecution has an objection, I rule this court to be dismissed."

You murderer! You murderer! Mister Cogley, we've got to stop this. Make him take a ground assignment. I realise it wasn't his fault. I won't make any trouble. Make him change his plea. I was just so upset that night. I'm sorry. But I have to. I never realised how close you and Dad had been until I read through some papers he wrote, letters to Mother and me.

Variants at second level Depreciating unusually fast. Mister Spock, we're running out of time. Power returning, Mister Spock. Up fourteen points and rising. One third power. Orbit stabilising."
2120,TOS,episode 20,COGLEY,"You Kirk? I figure we'll be spending some time together, so I moved in. What's the matter? Don't you like books? A computer, huh? I got one of these in my office. Contains all the precedents. The synthesis of all the great legal decisions written throughout time. I never use it. I've got my own system. Books, young man, books. Thousands of them. If time wasn't so important, I'd show you something. My library. Thousands of books. This is where the law is. Not in that homogenised, pasteurised, synthesiser. Do you want to know the law, the ancient concepts in their own language, Learn the intent of the men who wrote them, from Moses to the tribunal of Alpha 3? Books. Right on both counts. Need a lawyer? No questions. No questions. No questions. Well, sir, the truth is, I've been holding back till we get this preliminary business out of the way. I'd like to call Captain Kirk to the stand. I wouldn't want to slow the wheels of progress. But then on the other hand, I wouldn't want those wheels to run over my client in their unbridled haste. Stop. I think that's enough. I wouldn't want to slow things up too much. Now, Captain, despite what these machines indicate, was there indeed a Red Alert before you jettisoned the pod? Please tell us about it. You did the right thing, but would you do it again? Your witness, Miss Shaw. Computers don't lie. I'm suggesting that maybe you did have a lapse. It was possible, you know, with the strain you were under. There's still time to change our plea. I could get you off. You did. Your professional career. There's no place to go, except back to court and hear the verdict. That's very commendable, Miss Finney, but most unusual. After all, Captain Kirk is accused of causing your father's death, and the evidence would indicate his guilt. No, but I may be getting ready. Sir, the defence rests. Sir, some new evidence has just been brought to my attention. I'd like to ask the court to I can't tell you, I'll have to show you. Is saving an innocent man's career a theatric? i I'd be delighted to, sir, now that I've got something human to talk about. Rights, sir, human rights. The Bible, the Code of Hammurabi and of Justinian, Magna Carta, the Constitution of the United States, Fundamental Declarations of the Martian colonies, the Statutes of Alpha Three. Gentlemen, these documents all speak of rights. Rights of the accused to a trial by his peers, to be represented by counsel, the rights of cross-examination, but most importantly, the right to be confronted by the witnesses against him, a right to which my client has been denied. All but one. The most devastating witness against my client is not a human being. It's a machine, an information system. The computer log of the Enterprise. Can ask this court adjourn and reconvene aboard that vessel. And I repeat, I speak of rights. A machine has none. A man must. My client has the right to face his accuser, and if you do not grant him that right, you have brought us down to the level of the machine. Indeed, you have elevated that machine above us. I ask that my motion be granted, and more than that, gentlemen. In the name of humanity, fading in the shadow of the machine, I demand it. I demand it! Captain's Log, Stardate 2950.1. After due consideration, the general court-martial has reconvened on board the Enterprise. How many games of chess did you win from the computer, Mister Spock? May that be considered unusual? Why? Could that have had an effect on the visual playback we saw? Hypothetically, Mister Spock. Hypothetically, Miss Shaw. If what you suggest had been done, it would be beyond the capabilities of most men. Is that true? What man aboard ship would it not be beyond? And at the moment, you have no records officer. Captain Kirk, will you tell the steps you took to find Mister Finney after the storm? Describe a phase one search. It presupposes, does it not, that a man wishes to be found? If you start a search for a man, you assume, don't you, that he wants to be found? He's not hiding? On a ship of this size, could a man evade such a search? Gentlemen, I submit to you that Lieutenant Commander Ben Finney is not dead. You shall have it, but first I need the co-operation of this court in conducting an experiment. Captain Kirk. Including myself, sir. I have an errand ashore of vital importance to the purpose of this court, and I will return. Thank you, sir."

You mean you're relieved because you think your career is saved. Well, you're wrong. Like you helped me all along? Kept me down Robbed me of my own command? I'm a good officer, as good as you. I've watched you for years. The great Captain Kirk. They told you to do it to me. You all conspired against me. You ruined me, but you won't do it anymore. Oh, I wouldn't kill you, Captain. Your own death would mean too little to you, But your ship It's dead. I've killed it. I tapped out your primary energy circuits. You're out of power. I know the ship, too. The Enterprise should've been mine. You kept me from it. Innocent? Officers and gentlemen, Captains all. Except for Finney and his one mistake. A long time ago, but they don't forget. But they are to blame. All of them. I was a good officer. I really was. I loved the service more than any man ever dared. Why shouldn't I? They killed me, didn't they? It's a fair trade. What do you mean? What? Why did you do that? Why did you bring her here? I'll kill you!"

Your analysis seems logical. Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No mechanism. Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason, they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now Telepathy, Captain. Amazing in this culture. It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like this. Inconsistent with this environment Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in all directions. An underground? How are you organised? Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative. Captain. Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this direction. Block them out. Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked. Projection, Captain. Unreal. He doesn't hear you, Captain. Where's Doctor McCoy? I should say they've been here and been removed. Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed? The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic. Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was, they merely rendered us unconscious. We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data. Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet in. There are gaps. Like Sulu. You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go. Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him? Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control. Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get through that door. And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension. Not simple, not ridiculous. Very, very dangerous. What about the Captain? We are not Archons, Marplon. Where is Reger? Who is Landru? Joy be with you. Peace and contentment. Captain. Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy. I am formulating a theory, Captain. Not here. The doctor. This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark. All is indeed peace and tranquillity. The peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the machine. All parts working in unison. Until new orders are received. The question is, who gives those orders? There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense. Sir? Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference. Captain. Spock to Enterprise. status report. Report, Scott. Captain. KIRK; All right. About Landru. Useless, Captain. A projection. A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of perfection. Peace, harmony. The good of the Body, Captain. That's the key. Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it? Not necessary, Captain. They have no guidance. Possibly for the first time in their lives. Then the body dies. Creativity is necessary for the health of the Body. What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine six thousand years ago. Marvellous. The late Landru, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering. A computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings. Predictably metaphysical. I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable. That is very kind of you, Captain. How often mankind has wished for a world as peaceful and secure as the one Landru provided."

These are the clothes they wear, not these. Landru. Landru. They're wonderful. They're the sweetest, friendliest people in the universe. It's paradise, my friend. Paradise. Paradise. Paradise. Captain's Log. Stardate 3156.2. While orbiting planet Beta Three trying to find some trace of the starship Archon that disappeared here a hundred years ago, a search party consisting of two Enterprise officers were sent to the planet below. Mister Sulu has returned, but in a highly agitated mental state. His condition requires I beam down with an additional search detail. Relieving you."
2153,TOS,episode 21,SCOTT,"Doctor McCoy, transporter room. Quickly. Captain, we're under attack. There are heat beams of some kind coming up from the planet surface. Our shields are holding, but they're taking all our power. If we try to warp out or move on impulse, we'll lose our shields and burn up like a cinder. Checking. We're going down, Captain. Unless we can get those beams off us so we can use our engines, we're due to hit atmosphere in less than twelve hours. Impossible to break away. I've tried the emergency bypass circuits but they haven't been effective. Mister Spock, I've been trying to reach you. The orbit's still decaying. I give it six hours, more or less. Those heat beams are still on us. You've got to cut them off, Mister Spock, or we'll cook. He's peaceful enough, but he worries me. On Sulu? Captain, are you all right? The heat rays are gone, Captain, and Mister Sulu's back to normal."

Doctor McCoy. Sulu, take it easy. Sit down. What happened? Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he? Materialisation completed. Kirk out. Like Sulu. If everybody on this planet is like him. Let's go. Joy to you. Yes. This Festival, it starts at six o'clock? Let's get out of here. KIRK; I'm sorry to break in on you like this. We didn't expect that kind of a welcome. Yes, that's right. We're from the valley. Yes. We heard that you might have rooms for us. We have no plans to attend the Festival, sir. I'd like to hear more about this Festival, and Landru. What about Landru? Landru. My guess is we have until morning. Let's put the time to good use. Doctor, do atmospheric readings to determine whether there's anything in the air to account for all this. Mister Lindstrom, correlate all that you've seen with any other sociological parallels, if any. Mister Spock, you and I have some serious thinking to do. When we leave here tomorrow morning, I want to have a plan of action. Spock. Spock, Lindstrom. Doc. He'll give her a shot. It'll calm her down. Trust us. What about Landru? Who is he? No. What if we are? We can take care of ourselves. What do you mean, absorbed? We're not going anywhere. I said we're not going anywhere. Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action. Why did you kill that man? You tell Landru that we'll come in our own time and that we'll speak to him. Where to? Quite a festival they had. What do you make of all this? Now they're back to normal. What is it? Phasers on stun. Which way, Reger? We'll handle Landru, Just get us out of this. I don't want to hurt them. Warn them back. Phasers on stun, wide field. Fire. Fire. Security. Lieutenant O'Neil. He's one of our men. Bring him along. We still don't know what's happened to the Archons. Which way? Bring him along. A lighting panel. Before Landru? How long ago was that? But not inconsistent with what we've seen. Security. Those staffs. Hollow tubes. Antennae for some sort of broadcast power. What is it, Mister Spock? Absorbed? What others? Who? Give him a shot. Keep him asleep. Reger, I want some answers. This underground. If Landru is so powerful, how do you survive? The Archons. Tell me about them. Pulled them down from the skies? A starship? Mister Spock, those power readings you took, are they? Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Status report. Orbit condition. Keep your shield up. Do everything you can to maintain orbit. We'll try and locate the source of the beam and stop it here. What is it? But beautiful, Mister Spock, with no apparatus at this end. You are holding my ship. I demand that you release it. We mean you no harm. Ours is a mission of peace and good will. Put that away. Landru, listen to me. Mister Spock. Wake up. Mister Lesley. He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Mister O'Neil. Where is here? No. All our phasers are gone. I checked. That's locked. Enough analysis. Let's think of a way to get out of here. What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected? Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human? Doc. How? Doc! Don't you know me? Think, man. The Enterprise. The ship. Remember? You do remember! No. All right. Work on Bones. See if you can't Joy to you, friend. Peace and contentment will fill you. You will know the peace of Landru. Peace and tranquillity to you. Are you all right? I understand. Landru. And? Joy be yours, and tranquillity, my friend. The Body is one. My friends. What is your theory, Mister Spock? And when something unexplained happens, their routine is disrupted. Landru. You're thinking the same thing I am. Mister Spock, the plug must be pulled. Landru must die. That refers to a living, growing culture. Do you think this one is? What we need is more information about Landru. You said you wanted us to help you. Never mind what the prophecy says. If you want to be liberated from Landru, we'll need your help. Peace to you, friend. Joy and tranquillity. Doc, I don't want to hurt you. Spock. Isn't that somewhat old-fashioned? Robes. Where is Landru? Where do we find him? In this building? You're going to take us there. Spock, call the Enterprise. Snap out of it! Start acting like men. Scotty, stand by. We're doing the best we can. How's Mister Sulu? Put a guard on him. That's an order. Watch him. Captain out. What happened to him? You said you wanted freedom. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. Come on. We're going to find Landru. It's too late for that. All right, it's up to you. Take us to Landru. Open it. Open it. Landru! Landru. We are the Archons. We are the Archons. We've come to speak. We are the Archons. We want to talk to you. We have no intention of causing harm. We do not intend to die. Listen to me. Yes, Mister Spock. Let's have a look at the projector. Of course. It had to be. Landru. But no soul. Pull out its plug, Mister Spock. Landru died six thousand years ago. But not his wisdom. He may have programmed you, but he could not have given you a soul. You are a machine. Yes. What is the good? Landru is dead. You are a machine. A question has been put to you. Answer it. Then I put it to you that you have disobeyed the Prime Directive. You are harmful to the Body. The body is dying. You are destroying it. What have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual of the Body? Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity. Without creativity, there is no life. The body dies. The fault is yours. Landru, answer the question. You must create the good. That is the will of Landru, nothing else. Then the evil must be destroyed. That is the Prime Directive. And you are the evil. You are the evil. The evil must be destroyed. Fulfill the Prime Directive. You are the evil. Fulfill the Prime Directive. Well, Marplon, you're on your own now. I hope you're up to it. And you can get rid of those robes. If I were you, I'd start look for another job. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. What about the ship? Excellent, Scotty. Stand by to beam up landing party. Let's go and see how the others are doing. Marplon can finish up here. Captain's log, stardate 3158.7 The Enterprise is preparing to leave Beta Three in Star system C One Eleven. Sociologist Lindstrom is remaining behind with a party of experts who will help restore the planet's culture to a human form. What? But only a machine, Mister Spock. The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, his understanding, his soul, Mister Spock. You'd make a splendid computer, Mister Spock. Yes, Lindstrom. How's it going? Sounds most promising. Good luck. Yes. And we never got it. Just lucky, I guess. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc.

You will come. It is the law. You must come. It is clear that you simply did not understand. I will re-phrase. You are ordered to accompany us to the absorption chambers. Out of order. You will obey. It is the word of Landru. You cannot. It is Landru. Come. Then you will die. Come. With thanks. Happy communing. You. Come. Landru! Guide us, Landru!"
2304,TOS,episode 21,MARPLON,"I am Marplon. It is your hour. Happy communing. Have no fear, friend. The effect is harmless. My name is Marplon. I was too late to save your first two friends. They have been absorbed. Beware of them. He is unharmed, unchanged. I am the third man in Reger's triad. We have been awaiting your return. Whatever you may call yourselves, you are in fulfillment of prophecy. We ask your help. He will join us. He is immune to absorption. Hurry. We have not much time. I cannot answer your questions now. Landru, he will hear. Here are your weapons. You may need them. Behave as you saw your Captain behave. It is done. It is the gift of Landru. I've brought your signalling devices. You may need them. The prophecy says No, no. We do not see him. We hear him, in the Hall of Audiences. Yes. No. He's still alive. He is here now. He sees. He hears. We have destroyed ourselves. Please, no more. This is the Hall of Audiences. But this is Landru. Landru speaks here. Landru! He comes! Is this truly Landru?"
2305,TOS,episode 21,TULA,"You're from the Valley? My father will be glad to put you up, though. It's right over there."
2306,TOS,episode 21,LANDRU,"I am Landru. You have come as destroyers. You bring an infection. You have come to a world without hate, without fear, without conflict. No war, no disease, no crime. None of the ancient evils. Landru seeks tranquillity. Peace for all. The universal good. The good must transcend the evil. It shall be done. So it has been since the beginning. You will be absorbed. Your individuality will merge into the unity of the good, and in your submergence into the common being of the Body, you will find contentment and fulfillment. You will experience the absolute good. Despite my efforts to save you, you have invaded the Body and you are causing great harm. Obliteration is necessary. The infection is strong. For the good of the Body, you must die. It is a great sorrow. All who saw you, all who know of your presence here must be excised. The memory of the Body will be cleansed. I am Landru. You have intruded. Your devices have been neutralised. So it shall be with you. I am Landru. I am Landru. I am he. All that he was, I am. His experience, his knowledge. Your statement is irrelevant. You will be obliterated. The good of the Body is the Prime Directive. I am Landru. The good is the harmonious continuation of the Body. The good is peace, tranquillity. The good of the Body is the directive. The body is. It exists. It is healthy. Do you ask a question? Insufficient data. I am not programmed to answer that question. Peace, order, and tranquillity are maintained. The body lives, but I reserve creativity to me. This is impossible. But there is evil. I think. I live. Landru, help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!"
2307,TOS,episode 21,O'NEIL,"It's no use. They're everywhere. It's no use, Mister Sulu. Look, there's one of them. There's another one. We've got to make a run for it. We can't just stand here. Run, I tell you. We've got to get out of here. You know what they're capable of."
2308,TOS,episode 21,TAMAR,"Welcome? You are strangers? Hacom, these be strangers. The Valley has different ways. No, of course not. It's simply they may have different ways. Surely, Hacom, they already know. Are they not infallible? But, Hacom It is true then. You did not attend the Festival last night. We must hide them. Quickly. The Lawgivers. Landru will know. He will come. No, Hacom. It was a jest. I hear and obey the voice of Landru."
2309,TOS,episode 21,HACOM,"You came for the Festival? Then how come you here? Reger, these are young men. They are not old enough to be excused. Well, have they no Lawgivers in the Valley? Why be they not at the Festival? The Red Hour has already struck. Do you say that Landru is not everywhere? She is in festival, as you should be. The Lawgivers should know. You mock them! You mock the Lawgivers. And the strangers are not of the Body. You will see. He is the one. He mocked the Lawgivers. I heard him. The others, they were here, but they scorned the Festival. I saw it. There, you see? Not of the body. Landru."
2310,TOS,episode 21,REGER,"Yes. Yes. I know. It's Festival. It's the will of Landru. They're visitors. There. You see, Hacom? They've merely come looking for a place to rest afterwards. They've come looking for shelter. Can I turn them away? Come, please. Come, please. Hurry. You can return here at the close of the Festival. It's quiet. You'll have need of rest. The hour is struck. You can hear. Landru? You ask? You're strange. You scorn Festival? Are you? Are you? No, no it's all over now. It's all over now, child. That's all right. Quiet. It's all right. It's all over. It's Landru's will. Then you're not of the Body. You couldn't be. Are you, are you Archons? It was said more would follow. If you are indeed They're communing. We have time. Come with me. To a place I know. You'll be safe there, but we must hurry. Landru will come. Peace. No, it wasn't Bilar. It was Landru. Let's hurry, we haven't much time. It's too late. Look. Landru. He's summoning the body. Perhaps through there, but Landru They're in the Body. It's Landru. Not anymore. He's been absorbed. The Lieutenant is one of them. When he wakes, Landru will find us through him. Leave him there. He's our enemy. He's been absorbed. Comes from a time before Landru. Nobody knows positively. Some say as long ago as six thousand years. He must not. He's been absorbed. The Body absorbs its enemies. It only kills when it has to. When the first Archons came, they were free, out of control, opposing the will of Landru. Many were killed, many more were absorbed. When he regains consciousness, Landru will find us through him. And if the others come Those like you and me, who resist Landru. In threes. Myself, Tamar, who's dead now, and one other. I don't know. Tamar was my contact. He must not regain consciousness. He'll destroy us all. He's of the Body. I don't know, Captain. Some of us escape the directives. Not many, but a few. It was that way when the first Archons came. They had invaded the Body, but they resisted the will of Landru. You see, Landru had pulled them down from the skies. Landru. Oh. Oh. Captain's log, stardate 3157.4. The Enterprise, still under attack by some sort of heat rays from the surface of Beta Three, is now being commanded by Engineering Officer Scott. The shore party has been taken by the creature called Landru. There was war. Convulsions. The world was destroying itself. Landru was our leader. He saw the truth. He changed the world. He took us back, back to a simple time. A time of peace and tranquillity. No, no, I was wrong! I submit, I bear myself to the will of Landru! No! Lawgivers! Help! Help me!"

You didn't even try to bring her back. What kind of father are you? Your daughter. That's the man. Captain, now that we've got Lieutenant O'Neil, let's beam up out of here. Maybe he'll hear this. Oh, does my head ache. Oh, is that what it was? Well? Are we just going to stand here? Well, this is simply ridiculous. A bunch of stone age characters running around in robes. I just wanted to say goodbye, Captain. Couldn't be better. Already this morning, we've had half a dozen domestic quarrels and two genuine knock-down drag-outs. It may not be paradise, but it's certainly human."

I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong. Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain, the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s. Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens. Sensor reading, Captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel. Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars. However, scanners make out a name. SS Botany Bay. No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary, however. The mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called World War. Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding. Lieutenant McGivers. Attention. The following personnel report to transporter room. Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers. Acknowledge. A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record what so ever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system. And why no record of the trip? If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion. Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships. Even a theory requires some facts, Captain. So far I have none. Irritation? I am not capable of that emotion. Insufficient facts always invites danger, Captain. Aye, sir. I note he's making considerable use of our technical library. There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations. Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability breeds superior ambition. I have collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated. Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty Napoleons might still be alive? And how you managed to keep it out of the history books. There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble effort. Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip? Under dozens of petty dictatorships. Then your sympathies were with From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of your world. From Asia through the Middle East. Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is And as little freedom. Gentlemen. Illogical. Turbo elevators inoperative. Jammed, Captain. Useless. They're on override in Engineering. Impossible. Intruder control systems inoperative. Mister Khan was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals. Brilliant. Every contingency anticipated. Surprised to see you, Captain, though pleased. Khan is holding our staff in the briefing room. His men have control of the ship. There's a relay junction down the corridor. Anesthesia gas in all sections except Engineering. Someone just closed that line. Captain, acknowledge. Unable to flood Engineering section. I suspect Negative. We must retake the vessel while the anesthesia lasts. Meet me in the Armoury. I'm blowing it clear first. Spock out. Quite correct, Captain. Planet number five there is habitable, although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable. It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you planted today."

We're continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there. Very faint, very slow. Seems to be coming from about sixty or seventy bodies, as near as I can tell. Could be. There's no sign of breathing or other form of respiration. The Eugenics Wars. Now, wait a minute. Not our attempt, Mister Spock. A group of ambitious scientists. I'm sure you know the type. Devoted to logic, completely unemotional Well, if you're actually giving me a choice No. I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget. It's theoretically possible. I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period. Jim, I have a new reading. The lights must have triggered some mechanism. We've triggered something, all right. His heart beat's increasing. Now passing eight beats per minute. There are some signs of respiration beginning. Heart beat now approaching forty per minute. The respiration pattern is firming up. Heart beat now fifty two and increasing. Maybe. Heart beat dropping. Heartbeat now thirty, dropping fast. It's a heart flutter. He's dying. He'll die in seconds if we don't. That'll be all. He'll live. No, I'm good, but not that good. There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death. Look at that. Even as he is now, his heart valve action has twice the power of yours and mine. Lung efficiency is fifty percent better. I'd estimate he could lift us both with one arm. It will be interesting to see if his brain matches his body. It appears he will, Lieutenant. A pity you wasted your life on command, Jim. You'd have made a fair psychologist. Sickbay to lab. Anything new on those bios? Good. McCoy out. Well, either choke me or cut my throat. Make up your mind. You're in You're in bed, holding a knife at your doctor's throat. It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery, just under the left ear. I was simply trying to avoid an argument. You're aboard the United Spaceship Enterprise. Your vessel is in tow. That is correct. I have a patient here with many questions, Captain. Jim. A little later might be better. Very impressive. Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner? Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim. Well, he has a magnetism. Almost electric. You felt it. And it could over power McGivers with her preoccupation with the past. The last of the tyrants to be overthrown. No wars until he was attacked. To be conquered by you. A starship would make that most simple, wouldn't it? Jim. Agreed you have the authority"

Old type atomic power. Bulky, solid. I think they used to call them transistor units. I'd love to tear this baby apart. Beats me what's happening. This one was probably programmed to be triggered first. There's no change, and they're mixed types. Western, mid-European, Latin, Oriental. Probably some dust. It'd take an hour to figure it out. Scott here. Negative, Captain. It appears they were in suspended animation when the ship took off. Twelve units have malfunctioned, leaving seventy two still operating. Thirty of those are women. I must confess, gentlemen. I've always held a sneaking admiration for this one. There were no massacres under his rule. Captain! Where is Captain Kirk? I don't know. He got out just as the gas This is Scott. Captain's headed for the Engineering section. I'll follow in case It's a shame for a good Scotsman to admit it, but I'm not up on Milton."

An emotional Earth weakness of mine. There it is. An old Earth vessel, similar to the DY=500 class. Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic. Weapons status. Bioscanners report. All decks go to full alert. Weapons department, maintain battle stations. All other decks standby alert. Alien bodies, Bones? Then you can check the registry. All right, all right, gentlemen. As you were. Rig for tractor beam, Helm. Lock onto that vessel. The Bridge is yours, Mister Spock. Care to join the landing party, Doctor? I'm not. Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-Century Earth. Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change. What's her name? McIvers? Very interesting. You ready, Bones? You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy. Where's that historian? Come on, Lieutenant Energise. Scotty? Suspended animation. Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel? Scotty? Could he be the leader? The leader. Lieutenant? The others? Circuit shorting. Can we? What happens if we get him out of there? How long have you been sleeping? Two centuries we estimate. Landing party to Enterprise. Come in. Lock in on McCoy's beam. He's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here. Kirk to boarding party. Scotty, any records, log books of any kind? How many alive? Kirk out. Seventy two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mister Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years. Botany Bay. That was the name of a penal colony on shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel Oh? Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours. And that irritates you, Mister Spock. Yeah. My apologies, Mister Spock. You suspect some danger in them? Well, we'd better get some facts. Rig for towing. Make course for Starbase Twelve. Bones? My compliments. An improved breed of human. That's what the Eugenics War was all about. I'd like to talk to you. If I were to rate your performance as a member of the landing party today I Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel might depend upon the performance of a single crewman, and the fact that you find a man strangely compelling to you personally And men were more adventuresome then. Bolder, more colourful. Good. If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes. That's all. Fair? Bridge. On my way. James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. And your name? Our heading is Starbase Twelve, a planet in the Gamma 400 star system. Our command base in this sector. Is that of any use to you? Seventy two of your life-support canisters are still functioning. As soon as we reach Starbase Twelve. And now Khan. Nothing else? What was the exact date of your lift off? We know it was sometime in the early 1990s, but The facts I need, Mister Khan, will take very little time. For example, the nature of your expedition. Yes, I understand. You have two hundred years of catching up to do. They're available to any patient on the viewing screen. Doctor McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes. This Khan is not what I expected of a twentieth century man. Common courtesy, Mister Spock. He'll spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding? Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant. They began to battle among themselves. Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons. That fact isn't in the history texts. Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century. Just how strongly is she attracted to him? My curiosity's official, not personal, Bones. Forgive my curiosity, Mister Khan, but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey. You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mister Khan. This is a social occasion. You fled. Why? Were you afraid? But you left at the very time mankind needed courage. We? Name, Khan, as we know him today. Name, Khan Noonien Singh. He was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous. They were supermen, in a sense. Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more daring. Mister Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us. Appalling, but there, nevertheless. Mister Spock, you misunderstand us. We can be against him and admire him all at the same time. Totally. This is the Captain. Put a twenty four hour security on Mister Khan's quarters, effective immediately. Unusual treatment for Khan Noonien Singh. I'd like those answers now. First, the purpose of your star flight. Why? Because I'm not a product of controlled genetics? Thank you. They've all been answered. Maintain. Bridge. Sound security alert. Atmospheric controls cut off. Engineering. Scotty. This is the Bridge. What's going on down there? Flood all decks with neural gas. Contact Starbase Twelve. Negative. I'm a little pleased myself. Situation? Our only chance is the intruder control circuit. Although he's cut it off at the Bridge. Gas all decks but this one. Where's Khan? Kirk here. This hearing is now in session. Under the authority vested in me by Starfleet Command, I declare all charges and specifications in this matter have been dropped. Mister Spock, our heading takes us near the Ceti Alpha star system. But no more than Australia's Botany Bay colony was at the beginning. Those men went on to tame a continent, Mister Khan. Can you tame a world? Yes. I understand. Lieutenant Marla McGivers. Given a choice of court martial or accompanying them there. This hearing is closed. The statement Lucifer made when he fell into the pit. 'It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.' Yes, Mister Spock, it would indeed. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Did I hear it say I had been sleeping for two centuries? Where is your Captain? I have many questions. I see. I have a few questions first. What is your heading? And my people? You will revive them. I see. Khan is my name. Khan. I find myself growing fatigued, Doctor. May we continue this questioning at some other time? Captain, I wonder if I could have something to read during my convalescence. I was once an engineer of sorts. I would be most interested in studying the technical manuals on your vessel. Precisely. Thank you, Captain. You are very co-operative. Marla McGivers. I am told you participated in my rebirth. I've been reading up on starships, but they have one luxury not mentioned in the manuals. A beautiful woman. My name is Khan. Please sit and entertain me. And why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion? But it's not attractive. There. Soft. Natural. Simple. You find no pleasure here? There. Simple, soft. Please remember. I'm glad you came. Please do it again. Thank you. I hoped you might guide me to our dinner engagement. Very good. Fine technique. And you've rearranged your hair for me. Excellent. All bold men from the past. Richard, Leif Ericson, Napoleon. A hobby of yours, such men? I am honoured. Thank you. But I caution you. Such men dare take what they want. Adventure, Captain. Adventure. There was little else left on Earth. Tyranny, sir? Or an attempt to unify humanity? I know something of those years. Remember, it was a time of great dreams, of great aspiration. One man would have ruled eventually. As Rome under Caesar. Think of its accomplishments. You are an excellent tactician, Captain. You let your second in command attack while you sit and watch for weakness. It has been said that social occasions are only warfare concealed. Many prefer it more honest, more open. I've never been afraid. We offered the world order! Excellent. Excellent. But if you will excuse me, gentlemen and ladies, I grow fatigued again. With your permission, Captain, I will return to my quarters. Quite understandable, since I'm something of a mystery to them. Do you? Then I'll have to remold it to my liking. Go. Or stay. But do it because it is what you wish to do. Well? How many minutes do you graciously offer? This grows tiresome. You must now ask to stay. Open your heart. Will you open your heart? I intend to take this ship. Do you agree? I need your help. Now you question me? Will you assist me? Leave me then. Go, I say. I'm sorry, Captain. I was lost in thought. My door. Locked from outside, a guard posted. Excellent. You identified me with your computer system, I imagine. A new life, a chance to build a world. Other things I doubt you would understand. Captain, although your abilities intrigue me, you are quite honestly inferior. Mentally, physically. In fact, I am surprised how little improvement there has been in human evolution. Oh, there has been technical advancement, but, how little man himself has changed. Yes, it appears we will do well in your century, Captain. Do you have any other questions? Otto. Joaquin. The trip is over. The battle begins again. Only this time it's not a world we win. It's a universe. Kati. He's not able to answer you at the moment, Captain. Your ship is mine. I have shut off the life-support system to your Bridge, and jammed up your exit routes. I am willing to negotiate. Your air should be getting quite thin by now. Do you surrender the Bridge? Academic, Captain. Refuse, And every person on the Bridge will suffocate. Stardate 3142.8. They have my ship, discarding their own worthless vessel. Only moments of air left on the Bridge now. Commendations recommended for Lieutenant Uhura, Technicians First Class Thule and Harrison, Lieutenant Spinelli and, of course, Mister Spock. I take full responsibility. I take full Nothing ever changes, except man. Your technical accomplishments? Improve a mechanical device and you may double productivity. But improve man and you gain a thousand fold. I am such a man. Join me. I'll treat you well. I need your training to operate a vessel this complex. I see now I made one serious error. You are the Communications Officer? Engage the viewing screen, please. I should have realised that suffocating together on the Bridge would create heroic camaraderie among you. But it is quite a different thing to watch it happening to someone else. Engage the viewing screen. I'm sure you recognise your medical decompression chamber here, Doctor. And the meaning of that indicator. Your Captain will die. If you join me, Mister Spock, I will save his life. My vessel was useless. I need you and yours to select a colony planet. One with a population willing to be led by us. Each of you in turn will go in there. Die while the others watch. But I hoped you would be stronger. If any one of you joins me, anyone! I'll let him live. It's so useless! It does not matter. The Captain is dead. Take Mister Spock next. Armoury, this is Khan. Report. Rodriguez. Ling. McPherson. Anyone. Report status. If I understood your manuals, that's an overload in progress. Your ship flares up like an exploding sun within minutes. I have five times your strength. You're no match for me. Captain's Log. Stardate 3143.3. Control of the Enterprise has been regained. I wish my next decisions were no more difficult. Khan and his people. What a waste to put them in a reorientation centre. And what do I do about McGivers? Have you ever read Milton, Captain? It will be difficult. A struggle at first even to stay alive, to find food. A superior woman. I will take her. And I've gotten something else I wanted. A world to win, an empire to build."

2509,TOS,episode 22,MARLA,"McGivers. On my way. McGivers, sir. Captain, it's a sleeper ship. I've seen old photographs of this. Necessary because of the time involved in space travel until about the year 2018. It took years just to travel from one planet to another. What a handsome group of people. Captain, look here. Yes, sir. The leader was often set to revive first. This would allow him to decide whether the conditions warranted revival of the others. From the northern India area, I'd guess. Probably a Sikh. They were the most fantastic warriors. A man from the twentieth century coming alive. Do something, Captain. Magnificent. Captain's log, supplemental. Alongside the SS Botany Bay for ten hours now. A boarding party of engineering and medical specialists are now completing their examination of the mysterious vessel. Attempts to revive other sleepers await our success or failure with the casualty already beamed over. Doctor McCoy is frankly amazed at his physical and recuperative power. Doctor, will he live? I know, sir. I'm sorry. Not personally, Captain. Professionally. My profession is historian, and when I find a specimen from the past alive, I'm in the sheer delight of examining his mind. Yes, sir, I think they were. Yes, sir. Ship's historian, Lieutenant Yes. In a small way. I don't understand. I'd like some historical information about your ship, its purpose and It's comfortable. Mister Khan, I'm here on business. My interest is scientific. Men of. That is, the world of the past. I'm sure you understand to actually talk to a man of your century Perhaps some other time, when you feel more like talking about the past. It's a gladiator named Flavius. He once I wanted to apologise. They had no right to treat you that way. You're no mystery to me. I know exactly who you are. Leif Ericson, Richard the Lion Heart, Napoleon. I don't know if you're going to like living in our time. Please don't. I'll stay a little longer. I only meant I'd like to stay. Please. Yes. Oh, please don't ask me You won't harm anyone? No. Oh, please, Khan, don't ask me No. I promise. I'll do anything you ask. Move away. No! Khan. There's no reason I must watch this, is there? Khan said to watch him very closely. He may decide to co-operate. Captain, I saved your life. Now please don't kill him. I'll go with him, sir."

They've had space flight for several centuries, but they've never ventured beyond their own solar system. When first contacted more than fifty years ago, Eminiar Seven was at war with its nearest neighbour. The Earth expedition making the report failed to return from its mission. The Valiant. Listed as missing in space. Transporter room standing by, Captain. We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an official establishment. No hostility directed toward us. No apparent notice taken of us at all, which seems strange. They did scan us when we assumed orbit. Obviously, they know we're here. Screens down, but all defensive details on general alert status, Captain. Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people, and peaceful in the extreme. Yet you say you are at war. There is no evidence of this. With whom are you at war? Strange. Are these attacks frequent? None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula. Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind. Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers. Totally. Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical. There is a certain scientific logic about it. I do not approve. I understand. Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians, Captain. It may work. It may not. My pleasure, Captain. I understand. An entrance, Captain, but no exit. They go in, but they do not come out. So I would assume. Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder. We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete outfits of male clothing, and perhaps most important of all, one of their communication devices. Not at this time. Its range is restricted in comparison with ours. I may be able to alter its components, but it will take time. Spock to Enterprise, come in. Is the ship all right? The Captain is overdue. We've suffered no casualties among us. This is important. Under no circumstances shall any one beam down from the Enterprise. They'd be killed the moment they arrived. The Ambassador? Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand by for further orders. Spock out. Find the Ambassador and the Captain. Yeoman Tamula, you stay here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself. Knock her down if necessary. This is a killing situation. Do what you must to protect yourself. Clear? Please, Mister Fox. Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly away from the chamber or you may be injured. Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir. I'll take you to a place of comparative safety, then I must find the Captain. By now, Mister Ambassador, I'm sure you realise that normal diplomatic procedures are ineffective here. Very well, sir. We need all the help we can get. I had assumed you needed help. I see I'm in error. These are the attack computers, Captain. That one's defence, that one computes the casualties. They're all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts. At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement between the two warring parties. This one's the key. The circuit is now locked. Destroy this one, and they'll all go. There's a chance it may work, Captain. Captain, you took a big chance. A feeling is not much to go on. Captain, you almost make me believe in luck."

Would you have me open fire? Scott here, Captain. Mister Fox'll be glad to hear about that. Er, Captain? All personnel? Aye, aye, Captain. We'll start forming shore parties immediately. Scott out. Well now, what do you think of that? Well, I do. Computer, last message received and recorded from Captain Kirk. Run it through analyser. Question. Is it or is it not the Captain's voice? A voice duplicator? Well, they've got them, Doctor, and now they're trying to get us. Yes, Mister DePaul? Well, now. They're taking pot shots at us. Holding, Mister DePaul? Aye, but what about our Captain and the landing party down there somewhere? If they're alive, and if we can find them. That's a big planet. We can't fire full phasers with our screens up, and We can't lower our screens with their disruptors on us. Of course I could treat them to a few dozen photon torpedoes. Mister Fox, we're under attack. They're trying to knock us down. Of course, but I'm responsible for the safety of this ship. But they're the ones who're looking for a fight, Mister Fox. Diplomats. The best diplomat I know is a fully activated phaser bank. Maintain status, Mister DePaul. No, sir, I will not. I'll not lower the screens, not until the Captain tells me to. I know about your authority, but the screens stay up. No, sir. I won't lower the screens. That you can, sir, but I won't lower the screens. Aye. The haggis is in the fire for sure, but I'll not lower my defences on the word of that mealy-mouthed gentleman down below. Not until I know what happened to the Captain. Scotty here, Mister Spock. Go ahead. We've been through a bit, but we're all right now. How about the Captain and you? That ties it. That popinjay Fox went down a couple minutes ago. I knew it had a rotten ring to it. This is the Enterprise. Open a channel, Lieutenant. This is the commander of the Enterprise. All cities and installations on Eminiar Seven have been located, identified, and fed into our fire-control system. In one hour and forty five minutes The entire inhabited surface of your planet will be destroyed. You have that long to surrender your hostages. Aye, Captain, are you all right? Aye, aye, Captain. Is there anything else we can do? Scott here, Captain. Space details set, Captain."
2539,TOS,episode 23,KIRK,"Nothing yet, Lieutenant? Nothing yet, Ambassador. We're awaiting a reply. Today's the first time we've had any evidence they've picked up our signal. Are you sure? Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach that planet. No circumstances what so ever. Mister Fox, it is their planet. By disregarding code seven-ten, you might well involve us in an interplanetary war. You are. I'm thinking about this ship, my crew. Yes, Mister Spock. This is the Captain. Condition Yellow Alert. Phaser crews stand by. Deflector shields up. We're going in. Peacefully, I hope. But peacefully or not, we're going in. Captain's log, stardate 3192.5. Now in standard orbit around planet Eminiar Seven. My orders are clear. We must establish diplomatic relations at all cost. Preparing to beam down to planet surface. Anything else? Not alone. I'm taking some security people with me. I can't risk beaming you down there until I know what kind of reception you're going to receive. Your safety is my responsibility. Those are my orders, sir. Mister Spock. What co-ordinates? Final sensor readings? Ship's defences? Good. Landing party will pick up phaser number one's from the arsenal. Keep them inconspicuous. Mister Scott. The ship is yours. Take care of her until I come back. We'll do our best. Let's go. I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. Yes? I had orders to come here. Why did your people tell us to stay away? I see no danger here. I'm Captain Kirk. This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Lieutenants Galloway, Osborne, Yeoman Tamula. My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your people and mine. Would you mind telling me why? You're still at war? You conceal it very well. Mister Spock? To say the least. Don't you take shelter? What is it? Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock? Mea, if this is an attack, may I ask what weapons the enemy is using? Kirk to Bridge. Scotty? Scanners operative on the planet's surface? Anything unusual? Thank you. Kirk out. Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this entire planet under surveillance. All during this so-called attack of yours, we have been monitoring you. There's been no attack, no explosions, no radiations, no disturbances whatsoever. If this is some sort of game you're playing Computer don't kill a half million people. To report? You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration machine when they're told to? What has happened? We require a great deal. I wish to speak to Anan Seven. He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if he doesn't get in here and talk to me. Your duty doesn't include stepping into a disintegrator and disappearing. Is that all it means to you? To report and die? Then how can you stand No, I don't see that at all. Yes. Anan Seven. Good news, Mister Scott. The Eminians have agreed to the establishment of full normal diplomatic relations. They've also extended an invitation to all personnel to come ashore, for shore leave. They've assured me that our people will have a wonderful time. Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock? Do your best. Thank you, Mister Spock. We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship. Mister Spock, we'll need more weapons. We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill A disintegration machine. Mea. What do you think you're doing? You're not going in there. No you're not. Mister Spock, that guard. I'll cover you. All right, you people, clear out of the way. Throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery. I've done it. Come on, let's get out of here. The last place they'll look for us is the place we escaped from. Cover the door. Are you that anxious to die? Mister Spock, how did that little raid work out? Will it reach the ship? Work on it. We've got to contact the ship. Mea, I want you to give me a complete layout of this building complex. How do I get to the War Room? Now listen to me. I'm trying to help you. To save your life and the lives of millions like you. If you help me, maybe I can do it. If you don't, you'll die, we'll die, and the killing will go on. Or are you that fond of the war? We're going to try and stop the killing. We're trying to help. Believe me. Tell me what I want to know. Please. I didn't come to drink. A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it. I am? We're less cold-blooded about it than you are. I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators? You take a lot of chances, Councilman. If I were you, I'd think about saving my life. I'm not interested in discussing our differences. You don't seem to realise the risk you're taking. We don't make war with computers and herd the casualties into suicide stations. We make the real thing, Councilman. I could destroy this planet. I don't need the ship for that. That's exactly what I mean. You seem to think I'm joking. Where are the communicators? Something like that. My people are not responsible for your agreements. That seems to frighten you. Yes. You're quite right. I'm a barbarian. You said it yourself. Oh, no. You were quite accurate. I plan to prove it to you. Scotty, General Order Twenty Four. Two hours! In two hours! All that it means is that I won't be around for the destruction. You heard me give General Order Twenty Four. That means in two hours the Enterprise will destroy Eminiar Seven. I didn't start it, Councilman, but I'm liable to finish it. You're wrong. It hasn't begun. You have less than two hours, Councilman. Stop it? I'm counting on it. Hold it! Over there. You, over there. Move, move, move. Now we'll talk. No. I need the help. In there, Mister Spock. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in, Scotty. Everything's secure here. Maintain position. If everything goes according to plan, you can beam us up in ten minutes. If you don't hear from us, carry out General Order Twenty Four on schedule. Cross your fingers. Kirk out. Death, destruction, disease, horror. That's what war is all about, Anan. That's what makes it a thing to be avoided. You've made it neat and painless. So neat and painless, you've had no reason to stop it. And you've had it for five hundred years. Since it seems to be the only way I can save my crew and my ship, I'm going to end it for you, one way or another. Mister Ambassador. Would you mind taking these people out into the corridor and holding them there. You. Come with me. Mister Osborne. Our communicators, weapons. All right, Mister Spock. Yes, go on. Good. Get him out of here. Let's go. Against the wall! Yes, I do. I've given you back the horrors of war. The Vendikans now assume that you've broken your agreement and that you're preparing to wage real war with real weapons. They'll want do the same. Only the next attack they launch will do a lot more than count up numbers in a computer. They'll destroy cities, devastate your planet. You of course will want to retaliate. If I were you, I'd start making bombs. Yes, Councilman, you have a real war on your hands. You can either wage it with real weapons, or you might consider an alternative. Put an end to it. Make peace.  All right. It's instinctive. But the instinct can be fought. We're human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands, but we can stop it. We can admit that we're killers, but we're not going to kill today. That's all it takes. Knowing that we won't kill today. Contact Vendikar. I think you'll find that they're just as terrified, appalled, horrified as you are, that they'll do anything to avoid the alternative I've given you. Peace or utter destruction. It's up to you. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty? Cancel implementation of General Order Twenty Four. Alert transporter room. We're ready to beam up. Lay in a course for Argona Two, Navigator. Mister Scott. Good. Did I, Mister Spock? They've been killing three million people a year. It had been going on for five hundred years. An actual attack wouldn't have killed any more people than one of their computer attacks, but it would have ended their ability to make war. The fighting would have been over permanently. No. It was a calculated risk. Still, the Eminians keep a very orderly society, and actual war is a very messy business. A very, very messy business. I had a feeling that they would do anything to avoid it, even talk peace. Sometimes a feeling, Mister Spock, is all we humans have to go on. Why, Mister Spock, you almost make me believe in miracles. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios INC. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Councilman, I received a message from Vendikar. Our time is nearly up. Our quota is short by several thousand. They accuse us of reneging on the treaty. What are you going to do? Now wait a minute. Please, please!"
2708,TOS,episode 23,ANAN,"Welcome to Eminiar Seven. Well, Captain, what can we do for you? That is impossible. Because of the war. We have been at war for five hundred years. Casualties among our civilian population total from one to three million dead each year from direct enemy attack. That is one reason, Captain, why we told you to stay away. As long as your ship is orbiting our planet, it is in severe danger. The third planet in our system, called Vendikar. Originally settled by our people and now a ruthless enemy. Highly advanced technologically. Please excuse me. Vendikar is attacking. Mea, care for our guests. Yes, I see it. They were warned. Alert a security detachment. They may be needed. It's a vicious attack, extremely destructive. Fortunately, our defences are firming, but our casualties are high. Very high. This is no game, Captain. Half a million people have just been killed. Activate the attack units, Sar. Launch immediate counter attack. Yes, of course. Deaths have been registered. Of course they have twenty four hours to report. To our disintegration machines. You must understand, Captain, we have been at war for five hundred years. Under ordinary conditions, no civilisation could withstand that. But we have reached a solution. Oh, no, quite real. An attack is mathematically launched. I lost my wife in the last attack. Our civilisation lives. The people die, but our culture goes on. We have a high consciousness of duty, Captain. I'm glad you approve. Good. Then you will recall I warned you not to come here. You chose to ignore my warning. I'm sorry, but it's happened. Once your ship was in orbit about our planet, it became a legitimate target. It has been classified destroyed by a tricobalt satellite explosion. All persons aboard your ship have twenty four hours to report to our disintegration machines. In order to ensure their co-operation, I have ordered you, Captain, and your party held in custody until they surrender. If possible, we shall spare your ship, Captain, but its passengers and crew are already dead. Captain's log, delayed. The Enterprise, in orbit about Eminiar Seven, has been declared a casualty of an incredible war fought by computers. I and my landing party, though apparently not included as casualties aboard the Enterprise, are confined on the planet's surface, awaiting what? Yes, Mister Scott? All personnel. We'll transport up trained Eminians to assume support positions. Those are my orders, Mister Scott. All security personnel, Federation prisoners have escaped. They are to be found. They are armed. If they resist, do what is necessary. Planetary disruptor banks, calculate orbit of star cruiser now circling. Stand by to fire. Full power. In ten seconds, open fire. Destroy the star cruiser. Those are the orders of the Council. Ship's log, stardate 3193.0. Chief Engineer Scott recording. The Captain and First Officer are overdue and missing on the surface of Eminiar Seven. I have taken standard precautionary measures while we continue our attempts to locate them. Time is running out. We have been unable to destroy the Earth ship. One of our disintegration chambers has been eliminated and we have already fallen far behind in our quota. This is a grave crisis and I am at a loss to know how to proceed. What is the great immorality, open honesty or a deception which may save our lives? Put me through to the Earth Ambassador. A great honour, Mister Ambassador. A mistake, Mister Ambassador. We are at war. An error in our sensors indicated that your ship was about to attack us. I'm giving orders that our attack be stopped. Now, as to your representatives, you have my sacred word as an Eminian that they are alive and well. We are most anxious to establish relations with you, Mister Fox. We will make arrangements to receive you. The minute their screens are down, open fire. I apologise deeply for the misunderstanding. These are trying times for us, you understand. He will be there, sir. I give you my word. Won't you join me in a drink, Captain? You'll find our trova most interesting. I assume that is what you used to destroy disintegration chamber number twelve. My first impression was correct. You are a barbarian. Don't sound so incredulous, Captain. Of course you are. We all are. A killer first, a builder second. A hunter, a warrior, and let's be honest, a murderer. That is our joint heritage, is it not? What do you want, Captain? In a safe place. You're worried about your ship, Captain. I'm trying to save a world. Won't you have a drink, Captain? And then we can discuss our differences. Why do you think I don't let you talk to your ship ? You mean, all by yourself with a disruptor, you can destroy this planet? I had no idea you were so formidable. If I told you, Captain, would you walk right out and get them? Very well, Captain. They're in the War Room. Go left down the corridor, left again. They are unguarded. Is he alive? Pity. Man like that would have preferred to die fighting. Take him to the Council Room. Ambassador Fox? Welcome to Eminiar, Mister Ambassador. Mister Ambassador, I am truly sorry for what must happen. You and your party have been declared war casualties. You will be taken immediately to one of our casualty stations so that your deaths may be recorded. That is correct, Mister Ambassador. I regret it very much, but there is nothing I can do about it. Captain, surely you can see the position we are in. If your people do not report to our disintegration chambers, it is a violation of an agreement that dates back five hundred years. You will be responsible for an escalation that will destroy everything. Millions of people horribly killed. Complete destruction of our culture here and yes, the culture on Vendikar. Disaster, disease, starvation, horrible, lingering death, pain and anguish! It would frighten any sane man. Don't you understand, Captain? We have done away with all that. Now you are threatening to bring it down on us again. Are those five hundred people of yours more important than the hundreds of millions of innocent people on Eminiar and Vendikar? What kind of monster are you? I had hoped I'd spoken only figuratively. Open a channel to the Enterprise. You give me no choice, Captain. We are not bandits, but you force us to act as bandits. Enterprise, this is Anan Seven, First Councilman of the High Council of Eminiar. We hold your Captain, his party, your Ambassador and his party prisoners. Unless you immediately start transportation of all personnel aboard your ship to the surface, the hostages will be killed. You have thirty minutes. I mean it, Captain. Planetary defence System, open fire on the Enterprise! You wouldn't do this. Hundreds of millions of people. You see? It's started. What I want or don't want has nothing to do with it. Escalation is automatic. You can stop it! What can I do? Somebody, please tell me. You realise what you have done? There can be no peace. Don't you see? We've admitted it to ourselves. We're a killer species. It's instinctive. It's the same with you. Your General Order Twenty Four. There may be a chance. We have a direct channel with Vendikar's High Council. It hasn't been used in centuries."
2709,TOS,episode 23,TAMULA,"Sir? Working, sir. No evidence. What do we do now, Captain? Why did we come back here, Captain? What are you going to do, Mister Spock? Yes, sir."
2710,TOS,episode 23,MEA,"They will materialise there. Remember your instructions; They are to be treated correctly, nothing more. I know. I'm Mea 3. I congratulate you on your instrumentation. You've come directly to the Division of Control. If you'll follow me, please. Captain, I wish You were warned not to come here. It was for your own safety, Captain. The danger exists. Nevertheless, you are here. It would be morally incorrect to do less than extend our hospitality. Anan 7 and members of the High Council await you. If you will come this way, please. It will not last long. There is no shelter, Captain. Oh yes, and we will retaliate immediately. Oh! A hit right here in the city. Fusion bombs, materialised by the enemy over their targets. I have been sent to ask if you require anything. He's busy co-ordinating casualty lists. Don't you understand? Our duty I'm afraid mine does, Captain. I too have been declared a casualty. I must report to a disintegrator by noon tomorrow. My life is as dear to me as yours is to you, Captain. Don't you see? If I refuse to report, and others refuse, then Vendikar would have no choice but to launch real weapons. We would have to do the same to defend ourselves. More than people would die then. A whole civilisation would be destroyed. Surely you can see that ours is a better way. It's been our way for almost five hundred years. Is there anything I can bring you? I'm going But I must. Please. All right, don't worry about me. What are you doing? You can't do this. Captain, you've got to let me go. My time is almost up. You don't understand. No! What are you going to do? I believe you, but"
2711,TOS,episode 23,NGC,"Nothing yet, Lieutenant?"
2712,TOS,episode 23,FOX,"Have you received an answer to your message yet, Captain? Is that supposed to mean something? You will disregard that signal, Captain. Captain, in the past twenty years, thousands of lives have been lost in this quadrant. Lives that could have been saved if the Federation had a treaty port here. We mean to have that port and I'm here to get it. I'm quite prepared to take that risk. I have my orders, Captain, and now you have yours. You will proceed on course. Achieve orbit status and just leave the rest to me. You're well aware that my mission gives me the power of command. I now exercise it. You will proceed on course. That's a direct order. Kirk, what's this about you going down alone? It is my prerogative. You'll do no such thing, Mister Scott. You have taken defensive measures. There are no buts. Obviously it's a misunderstanding, and one of my jobs is to clear up misunderstandings. We have no proof of that. And I'm responsible for the success of this mission, and that's more important than this ship. Is that clear? We came here to establish diplomatic relations with these people. This is a diplomatic matter. If you check your regulations, you'll find that my orders get priority. I'll try to make contact with the planetary officials. Lieutenant, open up a channel and keep it open. Tell them to expect a priority one message from me. There will be no punitive measures, gentlemen. Those are my orders. Mister Anan, this is Robert Fox Special Ambassador for the United Federation of Planets. We have approached you openly With the intent of establishing formal and friendly relations between our peoples, but now, For some reason, you have attacked us, and apparently you're holding several special representatives of our Federation. Thank you. I thought perhaps it was all a mistake. I understand. Mister Anan, I presume that you have our ship's Captain on hand when I beam down. I'm sure that from this day forward, your planet and our Federation will attain the deepest friendship. I look forward to seeing you. Diplomacy, gentlemen, should be a job left to diplomats. You will, of course, immediately resume a peaceful status. What did you say? You are taking orders from me. You will lower the screens as a sign of good faith. My authority. I want you and expect you to obey my lawful orders. Your refusal to comply with my orders has endangered the entire success of this mission. I can have you sent to a penal colony for this. Your name will figure prominently in my report to the Federation Central. I am Robert Fox. Have I the honour of addressing Anan Seven? I beg your pardon? You mean we are to be killed? What are you doing? I'm a representative of the United Federation of Planets! A special representative! Spock! What are you doing, Mister Spock? They have him. The guards told us. They took him to the Council Room under heavy guard. I've never been a soldier, Mister Spock, but I learn very quickly. Yes, Captain. Gentlemen, if you please. As a third party interested only in peace and the establishment of normal relations, I should be glad to offer my services as negotiator between you and Vendikar. I've had some small experiences in such matters. Then it's long overdue. Shall we go?"

It is known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure. Sandoval's group could not have survived after three years. I am saying they knew there was a risk. The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. We can risk a limited exposure. Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our reports indicated. At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if necessary. But There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly. There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor, you know that. No cures, no serums, no antidotes. If a man is exposed long enough, he dies. Spock here, Captain. There seems to be a total absence of life on the planet, with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora. Not at the moment, sir. I am conducting various tests with the tricorder, but results are inconclusive. Nothing. Not even insects. Yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to Berthold rays. Please do. I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question. I would like to know how your people have managed to survive here. Logically, you should all be dead. Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist. You've not yet explained the nature of this thing. What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a happiness pill. And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not possible. Spores? No. No, I can't. Please, don't! I am not like you. I love you. I can love you. Captain's log, supplemental. We have been ordered by Starfleet Command to evacuate the colony on Omicron Three. However, the colony leader, Elias Sandoval, has refused all co-operation and will not listen to any arguments. That one looks like a dragon. You see the tail and the dorsal spines? I have. On Berengaria Seven. But I've never stopped to look at clouds before. Or rainbows. You know, I can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of the question. Yes, what did you want? Yes, Captain. What did you want? I don't believe I want to tell you. No, I don't think so. I don't think so, sir. I didn't want to, Jim. There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out. Very well. Come with me. Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu? I can see the Captain is going to be difficult. Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down. He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a drink, Jim. It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays. The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find a human body to inhabit. It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love. You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or later. Join us. Please. Yes, Jim. What is it now? Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down? Good. Leila and I will meet you at the beam down point. Spock here. What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting. Do you want me to beam up a party? Just a moment. It won't take long. Do you mind? Ready to beam up, Jim. The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man. Jim, I don't understand. Captain, if you'll excuse me. My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador. Captain, please don't That's enough. You did that to me deliberately. The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore. That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical. It can be done. Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence. That is quite logical, Captain. Enterprise. Spock here. Yes. Yes. I'm quite well. Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there? Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy. You won't need it to beam up. It'll take a few moments. Just wait there. Out. I'll be back shortly, Captain. It was necessary. I can't. I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge. I am what I am, Leila, and if there are self-made purgatories, then we all have to live in them. Mine can be no worse than someone else's. You couldn't pronounce it. They'll not hear this, of course. It'll be more a sensation of feeling it. Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes. Enterprise. Spock here. Just a moment. They're all beginning to call in, Captain. Rather contritely, I should say. Sandoval wishes to speak to you. Poetry, Captain. Non-regulation. I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the first time in my life I was happy. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

I think you'd better get back here. No, but I'd like you to see this for yourself. Sandoval's medical record, four years ago when the expedition left Earth. He registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child. No major operations, but there was an appendectomy. Received all required inoculations, et cetera. Nothing, but I examined that man no more than two hours ago. You know what his readings were? Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Just like everyone else I've examined here. No. I thought of that and tested it on myself. It accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once. It did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed. We've explained the Berthold rays to you and their effect. Can't you understand? Would you like to use a butterfly net on him, Captain? DeSalle said he was going to examine some native plants he found. Did Spock call in at all? That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim. I didn't say that. Not exactly. He might be in trouble. How will you find Spock? What are you doing with those things, DeSalle? Ready to beam up. Hiya, Jimmy boy! Hey, I've taken care of everything. All y'all gotta do is relax. Doctor's orders. Oh, must be nigh onto a hundred by now. I'm not interested in any physical-psychological aspects, Jim boy. We all perfectly healthy down here. Yeah. That's right. That's just what it is. Sho'nuf. Hey, Jim boy, y'all ever have a real cold Georgia-style mint julep, huh? Who wants to counteract paradise, Jim boy? McCoy out. Well now, it's a little early to be counting stars, Miss Leila. Well, now, I think I can fix that for you. Enterprise? What do you mean, what sort of work? I'm a doctor. Oh, no? Would you like to see how fast I can put you in a hospital? Just a minute. You'd better make me a mechanic. Then I can treat little tin gods like you. Sorry, Sandoval. I don't know what made me do that. You can't stay here. You can't survive without the spores. After you've cleared at the Starbase, you could be relocated. It depends upon what you want. Enterprise. This is McCoy. Sandoval would like to talk to the Captain. Well, Jim, I've just examined the last of the colonists, and they're all in absolutely perfect, perfect health. A fringe benefit left over by the spores. Well, that's the second time man's been thrown out of paradise."

Nothing. Captain, we've checked out everything. It all seems normal, except for the absence of any animals. We haven't seen them since we began our check. Yes, sir. Yes, I see now.

Mister Spock, there were one hundred and fifty men, women, and children in that colony. What are the chances of survivors? Are you saying that those people built a future in a place knowing they might not survive? And what about us? Can we afford to send people to the planet's surface? Thank you, Mister Painter. Mister Spock, equip a landing party of five to accompany me to the planet's surface. Include Doctor McCoy and a biologist. I'll want them in ten minutes. Another dream that failed. There's nothing sadder. It took these people a year to make the trip from Earth. They came all that way and died. Actually, Mister Sandoval, we didn't come here because of your silent radio. But these people shouldn't be alive. Gentlemen, we're debating in a vacuum. Let's go get some answers. What was the reason for the dispersal? Mister Sandoval, we do have a mission here. Examinations, tests. We'll try not to interfere with your work. Anything? Kirk here. Sulu had the same observation. Any explanations? Very well. Continue investigations. Kirk out. Yes, especially in view of the fact that the records for this expedition indicate that they did have some for breeding and food purposes. Apparently, none of them survived. Yes, I thought you might. He promised to throw away his shingle. Go ahead, Lieutenant. Make your point. It's like a jigsaw puzzle all one colour. No key to where the pieces fit in. Why? Kirk here. Trouble? On my way. What's so strange about that? Instrument malfunction? Mister Sandoval, within the hour I've received orders from Starfleet Command to evacuate all personnel from this colony. Naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations. We will have accommodations for you aboard the Enterprise. It's not an arbitrary decision on my part. I have my orders. What about your animals? That doesn't answer my question, sir. Why did all your animals die? Sandoval. You're being unreasonable. Excuse me. My orders are to remove all the colonists. That's exactly what I intend to do, with or without your help. ELIAS; Without, I should think. No, I think we'll use a We have orders to evacuate all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven. I want landing parties to co-ordinate the colonists and prepare them for transport up to the ship. We'll need extra accommodations aboard. Where's Mister Spock and Mister DeSalle? No, he didn't. Spock? See to the landing parties, would you, Mister Sulu. Spock? Spock! Spock, is that you? Where are you? Spock, I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is an order. Report back to me at the settlement in ten minutes. We're evacuating all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven. You don't think so, what? Spock, report to me immediately. Spock? Acknowledge. Spock. The frequency is open, but he doesn't answer. No. I thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a little. You said that. Yes, take over the landing party detail and start getting those colonists aboard. The frequency is open. It'll act as a homing device. Contact DeSalle. Have him meet you here. Make sure the landing party work in teams of two. I don't want anybody left alone down here. Spock. Mister Spock. Mister Spock. Are you out of your mind? You were told to report to me at once. You? Yes, I can see that. Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship. Mister Sulu, Mister Spock is under arrest, and he's in your custody until we get back to the Enterprise. What's? I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship. How many of those did you beam up? This is the Captain. Beam me up. I most certainly do. Energise. Lieutenant, put me through to Admiral Komack at Starfleet. What do you mean, you can't do that. Follow standard procedure. That's an order. Out? Get back to your stations. Get back to your stations. I said get back to your station. This is mutiny, mister. I've heard that word a lot lately. Perfect. Everything's perfect. I'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back. Look, Bones, I need your help. Can you run tests, blood samples, anything at all to give us a lead on what these things are, how to counteract them? Bones. Bones. Where's McCoy? In your own private paradise. Where did they originate? That's paradise? No wants. No needs. We weren't meant for that. None of us. Man stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than he is. Except a challenge. I'm going back to the ship. Engineering? Scotty? Biochemistry lab? Security? Is there anyone on board? This is the Captain. Captain's log, stardate 3417.7. Except for myself, all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet. Mutinied. Lieutenant Uhura has effectively sabotaged the communications station. I can only contact the surface of the planet. The ship can be maintained in orbit for several months, but even with automatic controls, I cannot pilot her alone. In effect, I am marooned here. I'm beginning to realise just how big this ship really is, how quiet. I don't know how to get my crew back, how to counteract the effect of the spores. I don't know what I can offer against paradise. Enterprise to Mister Spock. I've joined you. I understand now. There are some things in my quarters I want to pack. Kirk out. No. No! I can't leave! Emotions. Violent emotions. Needs. Anger. Captain's log, supplemental. I think I've discovered the answer, but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk. Mister Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being. Aroused, his great physical strength could kill. But it's a risk I'll have to take. Enterprise to Mister Spock. It's Jim. I've been packing some things, and I realise there's some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement. You know we can't come back on board once the last of us has left. No, I think you and I can handle it. Why don't you beam up now? Energising. All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship. What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid. Of course you don't understand. You don't have the brains to understand. All you have is printed circuits. What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia? Your father was a computer, like his son. An ambassador from a planet of traitors. A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity. You're a traitor from a race of traitors. Disloyal to the core, rotten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to make love to that girl. Does she know what she's getting, Spock? A carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in a mushroom, instead of passing himself off as a man? You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship. Right next to the dog-faced boy. Had enough? I didn't realise what it took to get under that thick hide of yours. Anyhow, I don't know what you're so mad about. It isn't every first officer who gets to belt his Captain several times. Believe me, Mister Spock, it was painful in more ways than one. You said they were benevolent and peaceful. Violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them. I had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence. That's the answer, Mister Spock. I had something else in mind. Can you put together a subsonic transmitter. Something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator? Good. Let's get to work. Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter? Mister Spock, Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spores? The Captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence. As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin. Put him on the speaker. Kirk here. Start making preparations, Mister Sandoval. We'll begin transporting your people aboard as soon as more of our crew checks in. Good. No, no, Bones. This time we walked out on our own. Maybe we weren't meant for paradise. Maybe we were meant to fight our way through. Struggle, claw our way up, scratch for every inch of the way. Maybe we can't stroll to the music of the lute. We must march to the sound of drums. We haven't heard much from you about Omicron Ceti Three, Mister Spock."

Mister Spock's feelings were never expressed to me. It is said he has none to give. There is no choice, Elias. He will stay. That can be explained. Later. And I never understood you. Until now. There was always a place in here where no one could come. There was only the face you allow people to see. Only one side you'd allow them to know. I missed you. If I tell you how we survived, will you try to understand how we feel about our life here? About each other? Someone else might believe that. Your shipmates, your Captain, but not me. Come. It's not much further. Its basic properties and elements are not important. What is important is it gives life, peace, love. Come. I was one of the first to find them. The spores. It shouldn't hurt. Not like this. It didn't hurt us. Now. Now, you belong to all of us and we to you. There's no need to hide your inner face any longer. We understand. I've never seen a dragon. Not here. I'll wait. I'm waiting for Mister Spock and the Captain to transport down. They had some equipment to be moved. But it's been so long. I wish he'd come back. This is Leila. I borrowed the doctor's communicator. I was worried something might have happened to you. You are all right, aren't you? Can I come aboard? I've never seen a starship before and I want to talk to you. Yes to both questions. You're no longer with us, are you? I felt something was wrong. Come back to the planet with me. You can belong again. Come back with me, please. I love you. I said that six years ago, and I can't seem to stop repeating myself. On Earth, you couldn't give anything of yourself. You couldn't even put your arms around me. We couldn't have anything together there. We couldn't have anything together anyplace else. We're happy here. I can't lose you now, Mister Spock. I can't. I have lost you, haven't I? And not only you, I've lost all of it. The spores. I've lost them, too. And this is for my good? Do you mind if I say I still love you? You never told me if you had another name, Mister Spock."
2916,TOS,episode 24,ELIAS,"Hardly that, sir. Welcome to Omicron Ceti Three. I'm Elias Sandoval. Captain's log, stardate 3417.3. We thought our mission to Omicron Ceti Three would be an unhappy one. We had expected to find no survivors of the agricultural colony there. Apparently, our information was incorrect. We haven't seen anyone outside our group for four years since we left Earth. We've been expecting someone for some time. Our subspace radio didn't work properly, and I'm afraid we didn't have anyone who could master its intricacies. It makes little difference, Captain. You're here. We're happy to see you. Come, let me show you our settlement. There are two other settlements, but we have forty five colonists here. We felt three groups would have better potential. If disease were to strike one group, the others would be less likely to be affected. You see, Omicron is an ideal agricultural planet. We determined not to suffer the fate of expeditions that went before us. Leila, come meet our guests. This is Leila Kalomi, our botanist. This is Captain Kirk, Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock. By all means, make them. I think you'll find our settlement an interesting one. Our philosophy is a simple one, that men should return to a less complicated life. We have few mechanical things here. No vehicles, no weapons. We have harmony here. Complete peace. Make yourselves at home, gentlemen. You've known the Vulcanian? Did you love him? How did he feel? Would you like him to stay with us now, to be as one of us? Captain, I've been looking for you. You haven't seen our fields and crops. I'd like to show you and the Doctor what we've accomplished here. You'll find no weaklings here. Captain. This is the reason, Captain. This soil will grow anything we plant in it. It's a perfect world. We have a moderate climate, moderate rains all year round. It gives us all we need. It is perfect. I have work to attend to myself, Captain. No. Captain, it's entirely unnecessary. We're in no danger here. Doctor, how can I make you understand? Your own instruments have shown that we're all in perfect health. We've had no deaths here. We're vegetarians. Captain, you stress very unimportant matters. We will not leave. Captain, your arguments are very valid, but they do not apply to us. Well, nevertheless. Excuse me. I'm very pleased. The entire landing operation is proceeding quite well. Captain, why don't you join us? The spores have made it that. In return, they give you complete health and peace of mind. We have no need or want, Captain. We have what we need. Well, Doctor, I've been thinking about what sort of work I could assign you to. Not any more, of course. We don't need you. Not as a doctor. I am the leader of this colony. I'll assign you whatever work I think suitable. We've done nothing here. No accomplishments, no progress. Three years wasted. We wanted to make this planet a garden. I think I'd, I think we'd like to get some work done. The work we started out to do. Oh, Captain, as I understood it, you were to transport us to Starbase Twenty Seven. We'll give you every co-operation."

2932,TOS,episode 25,SPOCK,"I'm sure there is an answer. It simply has not yet been discovered. There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain. Oh. You mean shot at it. Fascinating. Mister Vanderberg, what is this? But a geological oddity, to say the least. Pure silicon? I've charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage. Here, here, and here. If the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed. If we could force another appearance of this creature I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive. Traces may linger. The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong corrosive. Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain. The missing pump wasn't taken by accident. It was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the operation of the reactor. It would seem so. I don't know. But there is a possibility. Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds, but what if life exists based on another element? For instance, silicon. Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser two. It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one. Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon. It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment. Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature. I don't know. I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause for amusement. I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time. Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief Vanderberg's office. Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon? Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain. Interesting. A life form, Captain. Bearing one hundred eleven degrees, elevation four degrees. No, sir. Silicon. He never even had a chance to fire, Captain. Captain. What is it? This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour. Moments ago, in fact. Positive. Indeed, Captain. I'm quite at a loss. Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly. Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes. Are you all right, Captain? Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction. The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous asbestos. A mineral, Captain. It would seem so. Silicon-based. We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air. Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive. And it explains the murdered men. Or a single phaser with much longer contact. I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius one hundred miles. I've located our men, all of them, and I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred and one. And that is all. Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime. Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels. If so, if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it would be a crime against science. I see no alternative myself, Captain. It merely seems a pity. The search team is gathering in the main tunnel. Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please. I last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one. This particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions in an effort to surround it, and possibly capture it. You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose Very well, sir. II beg your pardon, sir? Is not needed there, sir. Mister Scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than I do. You're aware of that. Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search, against one creature. The odds against you and I both being killed are 2,228.7 to 1. And they are of course accurate, Captain. That is always my intention, Captain. Captain, we are being watched. No, sir. We're being watched. Captain. Fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels. Should we separate? Yes, Captain. Indeed? I find that most illuminating, Captain. Be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them. Only a theory I have. Captain? Are you all right? Jim? Jim! I could phaser you out. Very well, but I find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse. Please proceed with extreme caution. I shall quicken my pace. Captain, I just read some fresh signs. The creature is in this area. I'll take a lifeform reading. Where, Captain? Kill it, Captain, quickly. You don't dare take the chance, Captain. Kill it. Jim, your life is in danger. You can't take the risk. I remind you it's a proven killer. I'm on my way. Spock out. Fascinating. It's made no moves against you? Yes, I see. Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain. Captain, you are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds. It's possible. I'll try. Pain! Pain! Pain! That's all I got, Captain. Waves and waves of searing pain. It's in agony. I don't know, Captain. Evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me. In my brief contact with the creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal. In great pain, of course, because of its wound, but not reacting at all like a wounded creature. It calls itself a Horta. Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet. Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life. Doctor McCoy's medical knowledge will be totally useless. To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be necessary to touch it. Murder. Of thousands. Devils! Eternity ends. The chamber of the ages. The altar of tomorrow! Murderers! Stop them. Kill! Strike back! Monsters! The end of life. Murderers. Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into the tunnel. To the chamber of the ages. Cry for the children. Walk carefully in the vault of tomorrow. Sorrow for the murdered children. The thing you search for is there. Go. Go. Sadness. Sadness for the end of things. Go into the tunnel. There is a passageway. Quickly, quickly. It is time to sleep. It is over. Failure. The murderers have won. Death is welcome. Let it end here. Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch. There have been many generations of Horta on this planet. Every fifty thousand years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one, but the eggs live. She cares for them, protects them. And when they hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them. This creature here is the mother of her race. And they are the most inoffensive of creatures. They harbour ill will towards no one. Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die. It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind. And after close association with humans, I find that curiously refreshing. Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain. Course laid in. Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one. Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what the Mother Horta said to me. She found humanoid appearance revolting, but she thought she could get used to it. Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. I didn't have the heart to tell her that only I have Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature, with impeccable taste. Really, Captain, my modesty Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted."

Well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the plant's physician agrees with me. A chemical corrosion. Almost as if he'd been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid. Strong enough to eat anything else that you can think of. You're creating fantasies, Mister Spock. Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in an oxygen atmosphere. I still think you're imagining things. Yes, Captain? Is somebody injured? What happened? What in the name of? What is Spock doing? Help that? You can't be serious. That thing is virtually made out of stone! I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer. That's right, Lieutenant. Just beam it down to me immediately, and never mind what I want it for. I just want it! Now move! I'll let you know. It won't die. By golly, Jim, I'm beginning to think I can cure a rainy day. Help it? I cured it. Well, I had the ship beam down a hundred pounds of that thermoconcrete. You know, the kind we use to build emergency shelters out of. It's mostly silicone. So I just trowelled it into the wound, and it'll act like a bandage until it heals. Take a look. It's as good as new. Oh, she did, did she? Now tell me, did she happen to make any comment about those ears?"

2945,TOS,episode 25,SCOTT,"A pergium reactor? No, sir. We don't have any spare circulating pump for a thing like that. I haven't seen a PXK in twenty years. Well sir, I can put together some odds and ends, but it won't hold for long. Forty eight hours maybe, with a bit of luck. Aye, Captain. I'll be right down. Scott out. Well sir, it's a plumber's nightmare, but it'll hold for a bit. Sorry, sir. That's about the best I can do, but I guarantee it's not good enough. I'll do what I can, sir. Scotty here, Captain. My brilliant improvisation Just gave up the ghost. It couldn't stand the strain. Negative, Captain. It's gone for good. The reactor will go super-critical in about ten hours, Sir. You have that long to find the mechanism."
2946,TOS,episode 25,KIRK,"All right, let's assume there is a monster. What has it done? When did it start? Yes, we're aware of that. If mining conditions weren't so difficult, Janus Six could supply the mineral needs of a thousand planets. But what happened? Volcanic activity? Same way? Burned? Do you post sentries? Guards? Who else has seen this? Describe it. That's why we're here, Mister Vanderberg. I don't think we'll need to, Mister Appel. Mister Vanderberg, we'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries and tunnels. Mister Vanderberg, I'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries, tunnels. Thank you, Mister Vanderberg. We'll need your complete co-operation. The vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier. Doc? Explain. Strong enough to eat machinery? Mister Spock.  Mister Vanderberg, how recent are these charts? Before the appearance of whatever it is? I see. Mister Spock give us a report on life beneath the surface. Within range of our sensors, there is no life, other than the accountable human residents of this colony beneath the surface. At least, no life as we know it. We can't cover tunnel by tunnel on foot. We must get production going again. We must have that pergium. Too many tunnels. We couldn't possibly. Mister Spock, our sensors can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance, but what about abnormal life functions? Is there a replacement for that? Spock, on board? Mister Spock, we seem to have been given a choice. Death by asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning. Can you rig one up? It's vital. How long? Forty eight hours is better than nothing. Gather what you need and beam down here with it. {Bridge]KIRK Hopefully we'll have found the missing part by then. We'll have to, Chief. The alternative is to evacuate all you people up to the Enterprise. A dozen planets depend on you for pergium for their reactor. They're already screaming. Reactors closing down, life support systems Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet? But why now, Mister Spock? These production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years. What's that? Not necessarily, Bones. I've heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon. A silicon-based life would be of an entirely different order. It's possible that our phasers might not affect it. All right, how about this? A creature that lives deep in the planet below us, at home in solid rock. It seems to me that in order to survive, it would have to have some form of natural armour plating. But our people have phaser number two. You may be right, Doctor, but at least it's something to go on. Mister Spock, have Lieutenant Commander Giotto assemble the security troops and arm them with phaser number two. You make the proper adjustments. You seem fascinated by this rock. Do they tie in? Speculate. A short time, Mister Spock. We have very little. How's it going, Scotty? It has to hold longer than a bit. Kirk here. I'll be right there. Kirk out. Scotty, ride herd on it. Kind words. Tender, loving care. Kiss it. Baby it. Flatter it if you have to, but keep it going. You will proceed from level to level, checking out every foot, every opening. You are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire. Phasers will be set on maximum, and remember this. Fifty people have died. I want no more deaths. The creature may or may not attack on sight. However, you must. It is vitally important we get this installation back into production. It's one of the possibilities we've discussed. I want your people to stay on the top level, together at a safe place. Well, gentlemen, you have your instructions. Let's get at it. Mister Spock? Find something? Traces? One of our people? Come on. It's only been seconds since we heard him scream. The creature must still be around. This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour. Moments ago, in fact. Are you certain? This tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see. Our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this, not even with phasers. Gone. These walls are hot. Yes, perfectly. Yes, we saw it. Where does the tunnel go? Yes. We took a bite out of it. It's not animal tissue. What is it? Then your guess was right. Summation. That would account for the tunnels. Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber. It's definitely phaser resistant. We had our weapons set for silicon and on full power, yet we only damaged it. It still lives. You mean it's impossible to kill? No. No, it might require amassed phasers. Commander, pass this on to your men We knew it was a killer. Now it's wounded, probably in pain somewhere back there. There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal. Commander Giotto, instruct your men to concentrate the search in this sector. Remind them the creature is wounded. What is it, Mister Spock? One creature in a hundred miles? Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life span. Mister Spock, our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again. This is not a zoological expedition. Maintain a constant reading on the creature. If we have to, we'll use phasers to cut our own tunnels. We'll try to surround it. I'm sorry, Mister Spock, but I'm afraid the creature must die. Good. So it is wounded, and therefore twice as dangerous. Stay in pairs. If you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head. Concentrate it. Maintain it. It is definitely resistant, but it can be hurt. And if it can be hurt, it can be killed. Mister Spock. Your orders are shoot to kill. Protect yourself at all times. Commander Giotto, disperse your search parties. Mister Spock. Capture it? I don't recall giving any such order. I will lose no more men. The creature will be killed on sight and that's the end of it. Mister Spock. I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that makeshift circulating pump. You heard me. It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation. Your scientific knowledge Mister Spock, you are second in command. This will be a dangerous hunt. Either one of us by himself is expendable. Both of us are not. 2,228.7 to 1? Those are pretty good odds, Mister Spock. Of course. Well, I hate to use the word, but logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay. But please stay out of trouble, Mister Spock. Kirk here. Can you fix it again? Start immediate evacuation of all colonists to the Enterprise. We haven't enough phasers for you. Good. Get everybody else aboard the Enterprise. The fewer people we have breathing the air down here, the longer the rest of us will be able to hold out. How much longer, Scotty? We'll do our best. Start feeding us constant status reports, Scotty. Vanderberg, you and your crew assemble at level twenty three, checkpoint Tiger. Kirk out. Team up with the Enterprise security personnel. They're better armed than you. Keep someone in sight at all times. Vanderberg, take two men. Go through that tunnel there. Rendezvous with Commander Giotto. Appel and the rest of the men, go through there and tie up with Lieutenant Osborne's detail. Mister Spock and I will control the operation from a central point. That's all. Mister Spock? Are you sure? Intuition? The chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further. You take the left. I'll take the right. Two tunnels, two of us. We separate. Mister Spock. I've found a whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours, hundreds of them. Explain. Yes, Mister Spock, I'm all right. We seem to have had a cave-in. No. No, no, you'd better not. Any disturbance might bring down the rest of the wall. Besides, it isn't necessary. The chart said the tunnels meet further on. Very well, Mister Spock. I'll meet you at the other end. Kirk here. It's not necessary, Mister Spock. I know exactly where the creature is. Ten feet away from me. It's not making any threatening moves, Spock. I thought you were the one who wanted it kept alive, captured if possible. It seems to be waiting. Well, what do we do, just talk it over? Well, you can be hurt, can't you? We just sit here? It's your move. No, no! Don't shoot. Come on over, Mister Spock. No. It seems to be waiting. I tried talking to it, but it didn't do any good. Yes, they're all through here, all over the place. Thousands of them. Does it means something to you? You think you can get through to that thing? Mister Spock, I know it's a terrible personal lowering of mental barriers but if there's a chance No kill I. What is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a promise that it won't kill us? A Horta. A Horta! Mister Spock, we need that retardation mechanism. You must re-establish communications with it. Yes, I'm aware of that. If we could only win its confidence. Doctor McCoy, this is Captain Kirk. Grab your medical kit and come down here on the double. I've got a patient for you. Never mind. Just come down to the twenty third level. You'll be led to us by tricorder readings. Kirk out. He's a healer, let him heal. Mister Spock, you must re-establish communications. I want to know why it suddenly took to murder. We've seen how the creature destroys. Lieutenant Commander Giotto. Perfectly all right. Where are you? Under no circumstances allow them in here yet. The minute Doc McCoy gets there, send him through. It's wounded. Badly. You've got to help it. Go take a look. Help it. Treat it. You're a healer. There's a patient. That's an order. Mister Spock. Tell it we're trying to help. The mechanism. Mister Spock. Mister Spock. Spock. Spock! Come out of it. I found the unit in there. It's in pretty good shape. I also found about a million of these silicon nodules. They're eggs, aren't they? The miners must have broken into the hatchery. Their operations destroyed thousands of them. No wonder. How are you doing, Doc? Don't fire. First man that fires is dead. You've killed thousands of her children. Those round silicon nodules that you've been collecting and destroying? They're her eggs. Tell them, Mister Spock. The Horta is intelligent, peaceful, mild. She had no objection to sharing this planet with you, till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs. Then she fought back in the only way she knew how, as any mother would fight when her children are in danger. This is where they live. They digest rock, they tunnel for nourishment. Yes, I know. Here's your circulating pump. You've complained this planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it. Gentlemen, the Horta moves through rock the way we move through air, and it leaves tunnels. The greatest natural miners in the universe. It seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a modus vivendi. They tunnel. You collect and process, and your process operation would be a thousand times more profitable. Can you help it? How? Well, Spock, I'm going to have to ask you to get in touch with the Horta again. Tell her our proposition. She and her children can do all the tunnelling they want. Our people will remove the minerals, and each side will leave the other alone. Think she'll go for it? Very good, Mister Spock. Fine. Yes, Chief. Kirk here. I'm delighted to hear that, Chief. Once Mother Horta tells her kids what to look for, you people are going to be embarrassingly rich. Our pleasure, Chief. Kirk out. She really liked those ears? Because she approved of you? Does not bear close examination, Mister Spock. I suspect you're becoming more and more human all the time. Ahead, warp factor two. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc.

3123,TOS,episode 25,SCHMITTER,"Nobody ever does. Whatever the thing is, it's already killed fifty people. I never realised before how dark it is down here. What good will that do? You saw what happened to Ed Appel when he shot at it. How about those other people before the monster got them? Okay, Chief. I'll do what I can. A lot can happen in three minutes. Chief, is it true the Enterprise is on its way? You think it could get here in the next four hours?"
3124,TOS,episode 25,VANDERBERG,"It's your relief, Sam. All quiet? Stay on your toes, Schmitter. Keep your phaser in your hand at all times. I'm sorry, Schmitter. I know how you feel, but we've got to have guards. Keep alert. If you hear anything or see anything, call in. Somebody can arrive in three minutes. It's coming. You'll be all right. Come on. Schmitter. Like the rest of them. Burned to a crisp. Captain's log, stardate 3196.1. A distress call from the pergium production station on Janus Six has brought the Enterprise to that long-established colony. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, and I have beamed down to meet with Chief Engineer Vanderberg, administrative head of Janus Six. About three months ago, we opened up a new level. Sensors gave us an unusually rich pergium reading. Not only pergium, whatever you want. Uranium, sirium, platinum. The whole planet's like that. It's a treasure house. First, the automatic machinery, piece by piece, started to almost disintegrate. Metal began dissolving away. There was no reason for it, and our chemists were unable to analyse the corrosive agent. Yes, it has. I don't know what this butchering monster is, but I know what it's doing. Our maintenance engineers sent down to the drifts to repair the corroded machinery. We found them seared to a crisp. He's right. None. At first the deaths were down deep, but they've been moving up toward our levels. The last man died two days ago three levels below this. We kept it for you. There isn't much left. Roberts will show you. It isn't pretty. Of course. Five of them have died. This is Ed Appel, chief processing engineer. Ed shot it. You'll get it. It's a silicon nodule. There are a millions of them are down there. No commercial value. A few trace elements. Look, we didn't call you here so you could collect rocks. You'll have it. Just find that creature, whatever it is. I've got a quota to meet. Come on, Appel. They were made last year. That's right. When that creature appears, men die. Something's happening in the reactor room! Back to your stations. Look at that. Kirk, quickly! The main circulating pump for the entire reactor is gone. No, none. It's outdated, but we never had any trouble with it. Without the pump mechanism, the reactor will go supercritical. It could poison half the planet. We can't shut it down. It provides heat and air and life support for the whole colony. What happens when it breaks down? Hopefully. Small chance. I'm concerned with my people right here, Kirk. They're being murdered. You find that monster and kill it. Except the bloody thing. The twenty-third. Why? Commander Giotto, take your detail. Go directly to the twenty-third level. Start your search there. I don't know any safe place, Captain, the way that thing comes and goes. Not all of them, Captain. I and some of my key personnel are staying. We'll be down to join you. Then we'll use clubs. We're not being chased away from here. We're staying. Come on. That thing has killed fifty of my men. What? We didn't know. How could we? You mean if these eggs hatch, there'll be thousands of those things crawling around down here? Sounds all right, if it will work. Just wanted to tell you the eggs have started to hatch, Captain. First thing the little devils do is start to tunnel. We've already hit huge new pergium deposits. I'm afraid to tell you how much gold and platinum and rare earths we've uncovered. You know, the Horta aren't so bad once you're used to their appearance. Well. that's about it, Kirk. Thanks for everything."
3125,TOS,episode 25,GIOTTO,"Aye, aye, sir. May I ask if you have reason to suspect this creature may be on that level? Yes, perfectly. Did you see it? Did you shoot at it? No. No, it might require amassed phasers. Aye, aye, sir. Aye, aye, sir. Louis, Vinci, take your men out. Giotto here, Captain. Are you all right? We're at the end of the tunnel. Mister Vanderberg and his men are here, and they're pretty ugly. Shall I let them through? Aye, aye, sir. The Captain said for you to wait here, and here is where you'll wait. You're going to stay here."
3126,TOS,episode 25,PXK,Can you rig one up? It's vital.
3127,TOS,episode 25,APPEL,"I have. I can't. I only got a glimpse of it, but it's big and shaggy. No. I mean shot it. With this. A good, clean shot. Didn't even slow it down. Well, I've made my report to you. Production has stopped, nobody will go into the lower levels, and I don't blame them. If the Federation wants pergium, then you're going to have to do something about it. You're all pretty tough, aren't you? Starship, phaser banks. You can't get your starship down in the tunnels. That murdering monster's in there and we're going to kill it. There. They're coming. All right! All right, let's go! Now look, we have pergium to deliver."

3142,TOS,episode 26,SPOCK,"Captain, we've reached the designated position for scanning the coded directive tape. Strategically sound. Organia is the only Class M planet in the disputed area, ideally located for use by either side. Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D minus on Richter's scale of cultures. Sir? We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt. Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very light. Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act. Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want. With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy. Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain, and time is one thing we'll have the least of. Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance, Captain. Quite large. Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the reports we've been given on this culture. It would seem so. Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the village and make some studies. Captain, our information on these people and their culture was not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register. Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture. Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development. So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect. Captain, our phasers are gone. Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain. It is a practical approach. I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium. Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience. Not necessary, Commander. I understand you very well. It should not be underestimated, Captain. It reaches directly into the mind. We Vulcans have certain mental certain disciplines which enable me to maintain a shield. Without those disciplines, there would be no protection. I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you. 2 Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem. Accomplishing our mission here. I thought you might. We'll receive no help from the Organians. Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct approach? You did. A very meritorious idea, Captain. I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary. It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mister Spock. With a delayed action fuse. KIRK; Good. These crates contain chemical explosives. They should make a most satisfactory display. Six, five, four three. Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is ours. It can be a successful one. It's no use, Jim. There's no way out. Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual. They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar. We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick. Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel. Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well. It would appear so, Captain. But only two. More Organians will die. Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately 7,824.7 to 1. 7,824.7 to 1. I endeavour to be accurate. Very good. Clear, Captain. Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've got this far. I believe you'll find that several of them are no longer in perfect operating condition. You may be premature. There are many possibilities. Inexplicable, Captain. Extreme heat. Not only the weapons but the bodies as well. Fascinating. Pure energy. Pure thought. Totally incorporeal. Not life as we know it at all. Conventionalisations, I should say. Useless to the Organians. Created so that visitors such as ourselves, could have conventional points of reference. We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba. You've been most restrained since we left Organia. Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight. You and I have no reason to be embarrassed. We did, after all, beat the odds."

My screens are up. I can't drop them to beam you aboard. Captain. I can't explain it. We were just closing in on the Klingon fleet when Every control on our ship became too hot to handle. Our power's gone. Our phaser banks are dead."

3156,TOS,episode 26,KIRK,"Good. We both guessed right. Negotiations with the Klingon Empire are on the verge of breaking down. Starfleet Command anticipates a surprise attack. We are to proceed to Organia and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the Klingons from using it as a base. Organia's description, Mister Spock. Another Armenia, Belgium. The weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural invasion routes. Configuration, Mister Sulu. Phaser banks, lock on. Return fire. Maintain firing rate. One hundred percent dispersal pattern. Damage control, report to the first officer. All hands, maintain general alert. Hold battle stations. Damage report, Mister Spock. Maintain surveillance, Mister Sulu. Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just experienced very nearly qualifies. Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it. War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the Klingons. Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu. We won't get it by talking about it. The trigger's been pulled. We have to get there before the hammer falls. Ahead warp factor seven. Captain's log, stardate 3198.4. We have reached Organia and established standard orbit. No signs of hostile activities in this area. What bearing? Mister Sulu, have the phaser crews stand by their positions. Full power deflector screens. Mister Spock and I are going to the planet's surface. You will be in command. Your responsibility is to the Enterprise, not to us. Is that clear? The Klingon fleet is in this quadrant. We know that Organia will be a target. If they should emerge You will evaluate the situation. If there is a fleet of them, you'll get out of here, Mister Sulu. No buts. You'll get to safety and alert the fleet. You will not attack alone. Mister Spock and I will be all right. Mister Spock, let's you and I pay the Organians a visit. You'd think they had people beaming down every day. Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle. Reception committee? I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. This is my first officer Mister Spock. I would like to speak to someone in authority. You people are in great danger. Is there someplace we can go and talk? Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the Federation. My mission, frankly, is to keep them from doing it. No, sir. With the Federation, you have a choice. You have none with the Klingons. The Klingons are a military dictatorship. War is their way of life. Life under the Klingon rule would be very unpleasant. We offer you protection. You have this planet and its strategic location. I assure you that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises. We will help you build defences, build facilities. Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like yours. They are organised into vast slave labour camps. No freedoms whatsoever. Your goods will be confiscated. Hostages taken and killed, your leaders confined. You'd be far better off on a penal planet. Infinitely better off. You keep insisting there's no danger. I keep assuring you there is. Would you mind telling me That's the first thing that would be lost! Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm a soldier, not a diplomat. I can only tell you the truth. Certainly. That doesn't seem likely. Thank you, Mister Spock. That might be useful. Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider. We can be of immense help to you. In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists, technicians. We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before. We can help you build schools, educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills. Your public facilities are almost non-existent. We can help you remake your world, end disease, hunger, hardship. All we ask in return is that you let us help you. Now. Excuse me, sir. Kirk here. Positive identification? Mister Sulu, follow your orders. Get out of here. Contact the fleet. Return if the odds are more equal. Kirk out. Gentlemen, you kept insisting that there was no danger Can you verify that? If you had listened to me How does he know that? So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation army. You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very pleasant prospect at all. Captain's Log. stardate 3201.7. Mister Spock and I are trapped on the planet Organia, which is in the process of being occupied by the forces of the Klingon Empire. The Organians have provided us with native clothing in the hopes we may be taken for Organians. Did you take them? I must ask you to return them. They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation. What about the rest of you? You have a lot to learn, sir. And if I know the Klingons, you'll be learning it the hard way.   I have a tongue. My what? He's no spy. He's done nothing. Nothing at all. You're here. There's nothing I can do about it. You need my approval? You seem to be in command. Me? I don't want the job. And Mister Spock? He is my friend. I don't understand. And you're proud of it. Are you sure you're all right? Or I will be killed. That mindsifter can't be all the terror they think it is. I'll try and avoid it. 2 You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you? You're right. But as you say, we still have a job to do. Maybe, but sooner or later they'll start resenting how the Klingons run things. If we could prove to them they could do something to strike back, to keep the Klingons off balance. That's exactly what I had in mind. Mister Spock Did I or did I not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's headquarters? I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating. Tonight. We're short of tools. Okay so far. Sonic grenade? You were right, Mister Spock. A most satisfactory display. Of course we blew it up. Deliberately. We did it to show you that you can fight back. You don't have to be sheep, you can be wolves. History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship. We may not be able to destroy the Klingons, but we can tie them up. Blow up their installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to them. Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom mean so little to you? All I understand is that you apparently don't have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones.   I speak of courage, gentlemen. Does courage mean so little to you? Ayelborne! I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for the likes of you. No, thank you. What do you want from me? You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy? Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope. We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body. It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't like the Klingons. Go climb a tree. It will take a lot longer than that, Commander. How much of the twelve hours do we have left? I think we can count on them being punctual. Blowing that munitions dump wasn't enough. If we get out of here, we've got to carry the attack directly to Kor. These Organians Nevertheless, our orders still stand. We've got to make some attempt to neutralise the Klingon occupation. And there are guards every few feet down the hall. Go? You turned us over to them. You expect us to trust you now? We can't stay here. This is the first place they'll look. First you turn us in, then get us out. What are you doing now, waiting for the Klingons to post a reward so you can turn us in again and collect it? What happened to them? Is that's all you can do, smile? I want to know how I'm free, and why. This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves Those are Klingon phasers. Take the door. Get down, gentlemen. Did you hear them? Well, Mister Spock. It seems it's up to you and me. The Federation has invested a great deal of money in our training. They're about due for a small return. We have two hours with which to do it in. No. No more will die on account of us, Mister Spock. Where are those phasers? You've told us a great deal about how you hate violence. Unless you tell me where those phasers are, you're going to have more violence than you know what to do with. It's entirely up to you. Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your culture. Despite that, Mister Spock and I are going to go out there and quite probably die, in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for. Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here. Mister Spock, can we get those two guards? What would you say the odds on our getting out of here? Difficult to be precise? 7,824 to 1?  That's a pretty close approximation. You do quite well. Set your phaser on stun. We're after the top dog, not the members of the pack. But if the situation calls for it, we kill, is that clear? I'll take the one on the left. Fire. If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and now. Is that clear? Is Kor's office down there? What about the hostages? Talk. Talk. To be killed? Mister Spock. Well, what are the odds now? Less than seven thousand to one. Well, getting better. Getting better. Just stay where you are, Commander. Checkmate, Commander. I don't intend to kill you unless I have to. Cover, Spock! Back! What is it, Spock? You are stopping this? You? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Stand by, Sulu. What have you done? You're talking nonsense. You can't just stop the fleet. What gives you the right? We have legitimate grievances against the Klingons. They've invaded our territory, killed our citizens. They're openly aggressive. They've boasted that they'll take over half the galaxy. You're the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas! You should be the first to be on our side. Two hundred hostages killed. Even if you have some power that we don't understand, you have no right to dictate to our Federation How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right Well, no one wants war. But there are proper channels. People have a right to handle their own affairs. Eventually, we will have What do you mean, beings like yourselves? But what about this planet? The fields, the buildings, this citadel? Well, Commander, I guess that takes care of the war. Obviously, the Organians aren't going to let us fight. I'm embarrassed. I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want. We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe. It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong. Oh, no, no, no, Mister Spock, We didn't beat the odds. We didn't have a chance. The Organians raided the game. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc.

Ayelborne, several hundred men have appeared near the citadel. They bring many weapons. Ayelborne, this is of no matter. Perhaps you'd better let him have what he wants. He Interesting, however. They will wait until darkness. Terrible. Inconceivable. Savage. It has begun."
3339,TOS,episode 26,AYELBORNE,"Welcome. You are our visitors. Welcome, welcome. I am Ayelborne. You are most welcome, my friend. We don't have anybody in authority, but I am the chairman of the Council of Elders. Perhaps I would do. Oh, yes. Our council chambers are nearby. Please. Of course, my friend. Our village is yours. Captain. What you're saying, Captain, is that we seem to have a choice between dealing with you or your enemies. We are a simple people, Captain. We have nothing that anybody could want. We have no defences, Captain, nor are any needed. Captain, we see that your concern is genuine. We are moved. But again we assure you we are in absolutely no danger. If anybody is in danger, you are, and that concerns us greatly. It would be better if you returned to your ship as soon as possible. It is our way of life, Captain. If you will excuse us, Captain, we will discuss your kind offer. We have discussed your offer, Captain. Our opinion is unchanged. We are in no danger. We thank you for your kind offer of assistance, although we must decline it, and we strongly recommend that you leave Organia before you yourselves are endangered. Captain, I can see that you do not understand us. Perhaps That is correct, Captain. There is no danger. Thank you, Trefayne. Captain, since it is too late for you to escape, perhaps we should do something about protecting you. Oh, our friend Trefayne is really quite intuitive. You can rest assured that what he says is absolutely correct. Yes, Captain. I took them. I'm sorry, Captain. I cannot do that. Were you armed, you might be tempted to use violence, and that we cannot permit. You, Captain, will pass as an Organian, and Mister Spock. Mister Spock presents a problem. He doesn't look like an Organian. We shall continue as before. We have nothing to fear. I am Ayelborne, temporary head of the council. I bid you welcome. He is Baroner, one of our leading citizens. We shall obey your regulations, Commander. Commander, I assure you our people want nothing but peace. We shall cause you no trouble. But that was violence. Captain, I implore you never to do such a thing again. How little you understand us, Captain. What are you going to do with him, Commander? There's no need to use your machine on him, commander. I can tell you his name. It is Captain James T. Kirk. For some reason, he feels that he must destroy you, Commander, just as you feel you must destroy him. I didn't want you to harm him. I'm sorry, Captain. It was for the best. No harm would come of it. Oh, there you are, gentlemen. I trust you are in good health? Shall we go? Yes. Your captors plan to do violence to you. That we cannot permit. I came to take you away. Is there really a choice, Captain? I offer you safety. They will not come here, Captain. You may believe me. How little you understand us, Captain. Please do not concern yourself about them. Why, nothing happened to them, Captain. Nothing at all. You are free, Captain. We have already answered that question. To us, violence is unthinkable. Yes, of course, Captain. But nothing has changed. I cannot tell you. You mean you would actually use force? Very well, but it will do you no good. They're in that cabinet. There are only two of you against an army. Don't you realise that what you intend to do will be hopeless? Yes, but so foolish. Of course, we cannot allow it. To stop them is very bad. Trefayne. And then? We will wait. Very well. Prepare yourselves. We are terribly sorry to be forced to interfere, gentlemen, but we cannot permit you to harm yourselves. The same conditions exist on both the star-fleets. There will be no battle. I suggest you contact them. You too, Captain. Your ship is now within range of your communications device. As I stand here, I also stand upon the home planet of the Klingon Empire, and the home planet of your Federation, Captain. I'm going to put a stop to this insane war. It is being done. Unless both sides agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities, all your armed forces, wherever they may be, will be immediately immobilised. It is no trick, Commander. We have simply put an end to your war. All your military forces, wherever they are, are now completely paralysed. No one has been killed, Captain. To wage war, Captain? To kill millions of innocent people? To destroy life on a planetary scale? Is that what you're defending? Oh, eventually you will have peace, but only after millions of people have died. It is true that in the future, you and the Klingons will become fast friends. You will work together. Yes, please leave us. The mere presence of beings like yourselves is intensely painful to us. Millions of years ago, Captain, we were humanoid like yourselves, but we have developed beyond the need of physical bodies. That of us which you see is mere appearance for your sake."
3340,TOS,episode 26,KLINGON,"He is what he claims to be, Commander, a Vulcanian merchant named Spock. His main concern seems to be how he would carry out his business under our occupation. The usual. A certain amount of apprehension regarding us. The mind is remarkably disciplined. I used force four, which is sufficient to break down any pretence. Out of the way, Organian. Next time, keep your eyes open, or I'll shut them permanently. Commander! The two Federation prisoners. They're gone. I swear. No one was at fault. The guards, ten of them were constantly on duty watching the cell. Then when they opened it to give them food, they simply weren't there, and there was no way out. I swear! Sir! No results, Commander. I cannot understand these people. They do not seem to be worried about anything. Yes, sir. Yes. Yes. I am to gather two hundred more."
3341,TOS,episode 26,CLAYMARE,"We thank you for your altruistic offer, Captain, but we really do not need your protection. We must be sure you are not harmed. A Vulcan trader, perhaps. A dealer in kevas and trillium. Harmless to the Klingons. Terrible to destroy. Brave men. It is necessary. They may harm one another. It will be hard. We have put a stop to your violence. All instruments of violence on this planet now radiate a temperature of three hundred and fifty degrees. They are inoperative. We find interference in other people's affairs most disgusting, but you gentlemen have given us no choice. No one has died here in uncounted thousands of years. Your emotions are most discordant. We do not wish to seem inhospitable, but gentlemen, you must leave."
3342,TOS,episode 26,KOR,"This is the ruling council? No doubt you do. I am Kor, military governor of Organia. Who are you? And he has no tongue? Good. You will be taught how to use it. Where is your smile? The stupid, idiotic smile everyone else seems to be wearing. A Vulcan. Do you also have a tongue? Well, have we a ram among the sheep? Do you object to us taking him? Coming from an Organian, yours is practically an act of rebellion. Very good. So you welcome me. Do you also welcome me? Good honest hatred. Very refreshing. However, it makes no difference whether you welcome me or not. I am here and will stay. You are now subjects of the Klingon Empire. You'll find there are many rules and regulations. They will be posted. Violation of the smallest of them will be punished by death. You disapprove, Baroner. I need your obedience. Nothing more. Will I have it? Yes. I am. I shall need a representative from among you. Liaison between the forces of the occupation and the civil population. Smile and smile. I don't trust men who smile too much. You, Baroner, you're the man. Have I asked whether or not you want it? We Klingons have a reputation for ruthlessness. You will find that it is deserved. Should one Klingon soldier be killed, a thousand Organians will die. I will have order. Is that clear? I'm sure you will not. Take the Vulcan to the examination room. You, come with me. I will familiarise you with your new duties. You are concerned? You have a poor choice of friends. He will be examined. If he is lying, he will die. If he is telling the truth, he will find that business has taken a turn for the worse. Take him. You do not like to be pushed. Very good. You may be a man I can deal with, Baroner. Come with me. From this day on, no public assemblages of more than three people. All publications to be cleared through this office. Neighbourhood controls will be established, hostages selected. A somewhat lengthy list of crimes against the state. You do not like them? Well? Nothing else? You are sure? Very well, Lieutenant. Would you like to try our little truth finder? It's a mind-sifter or mind-ripper, depending on how much force is used. We can record every thought, every bit of knowledge in a man's mind. Of course, when that much force is used, the mind is emptied. Permanently, I'm afraid. What's left is more vegetable than human. It is a tool, a weapon. Somewhat drastic, but very efficient. All right, Vulcan, you may go. But you are an enemy alien. You will be under our scrutiny at all times. If I have to warn you Return to your council, Baroner. You will receive our official notifications as soon as they are published. In the meantime keep the people in order. It is your responsibility. That is exactly right. You will be killed. You speak of courage. Obviously you do not know the difference between courage and foolhardiness. Always it is the brave ones who die. The soldiers. I hope you will continue to savour the sweetness of your life. You disgust me. What is always done with spies and saboteurs. He will be killed, after he has had first-hand experience of our mind scanner. What? Captain of the Enterprise. A starship commander. And his first officer? I had hoped to meet you in battle, but That's going to be rather difficult now. Isn't it, Captain? What an admirable people. Do you always betray your friends? I don't blame you, Captain. Lock up the Vulcan. Take the Captain to my office. We'll have a talk before I do what must be done. You'll have a drink with me, Captain? I assure you it isn't drugged. With our mind-scanner, we have no need for such crude methods. Oh, a very great deal, but first I want to talk. Just talk. You'll talk. Either here, now, voluntarily, or under our mind-scanner. The fact is, Captain, I have a great admiration for your Starfleet. A remarkable instrument. and I must confess to a certain admiration for you. I know, of course, that it was you who destroyed our supplies last night. Hardly. They were quite important to us, but they can be replaced. You of the Federation, you are much like us. Come now. I'm not referring to minor ideological differences. I mean that we are similar as a species. Here we are on a planet of sheep. Two tigers, predators, hunters, killers, and it is precisely that which makes us great. And there is a universe to be taken. Excellent. Then it shall be a matter of testing each other's wills. Of power. Survival must be earned, Captain. Tell me about the dispersal of your Starfleet. . I can get what I want through our mind-scanner, but there would be very little of your mind left, Captain. I have no desire to see you become a vegetable. This friend of yours, the Vulcan. He seems to have the ability to block our scanner. I think perhaps I will find out why. I will have him dissected. Your friend killed. You, a mental vegetable. Not a pleasant prospect, Captain, but it lies ahead for you unless you tell me everything I want to know. Twelve hours, Captain. Longer than that I will not wait. I respect you, Captain, but this is war, a game we Klingons play to win. Take him to the cell with his friend. And watch him closely. Don't you see I'm busy? You mean they've escaped? If you're lying to me. All right, Lieutenant. Implement Special Occupation Order Number Four. Immediately! Attention. Attention all Organians. Attention. This is Commander Kor. The two Federation prisoners have escaped, obviously with outside aid. They will be returned immediately. So that you will know we mean what we say, listen. In the courtyard of my headquarters, Two hundred Organians have just been killed. KIRK; Two hundred of them. In two hours, two hundred more will die, and two hundred more after that until the two Federation spies are turned over to us. This is the order of Kor. Nothing? They know what death is, don't they? Bad enough to be a military governor, but to govern a population of sheep! Very well, Lieutenant, round up two hundred more. Fools! Will I have to kill them all? You have done well to get this far through my guards. So, you are here. You will be interested in knowing that a Federation fleet is on its way here at the moment. Our fleet is preparing to meet them. Shall we wait and see the results before you kill me? Sentimentality, mercy. The emotions of peace. Your weakness, Captain Kirk. The Klingon Empire shall win. Think of it, as we sit here, in space above us the destiny of the galaxy will be decided for the next ten thousand years. Can I offer you a drink? We can toast the victory of the Klingon fleet. Today we conquer. If some day we are defeated, well, war has its fortunes good and bad. Do you know why we are so strong? Because we are a unit. Each of us is part of the greater whole, always under surveillance. Even a commander like myself, always under surveillance, Captain. If you will note. Shoot! Shoot! What are you talking about? My fleet! Ridiculous! My fleet, it's helpless. You're what? You can't interfere. What happens in space is not your business. Why not? We're the stronger! You've tried to hem us in, cut off vital supplies, strangle our trade! You've been asking for war! They are not disputed! They're clearly ours. And now you step in with some kind of trick. You are liars. You are meddling in things that are none of your business. Or our Empire! Never! Captain, it's a trick. We can handle them. I have an army. But is all of this possible? A shame, Captain. It would have been glorious."

3358,TOS,episode 27,SPOCK,"Very typical, Captain. Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life. No surprises. Captain. Incredible, Captain. What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain. Twice, for a split second each time, everything within range of our instruments seemed on the verge of winking out. I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of which we're measuring, attained zero gravity. Is non-existence. Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface below. Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside. A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass, electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain. None. Possible. Very possible. Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal. Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable by any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath us. Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in order. My job, sir? Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest? Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered re-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to. I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar. I'm trying, Captain. Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet, almost on this very spot. Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than I can the first. That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude? Indeed. Affirmative. Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations. Request you come to the Bridge, Captain. Something quite extraordinary. Main screen on, Lieutenant. Source of radiation, Captain. Because it is not there. What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect. Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our universe. A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it. You refer to the humanoid? Why does he need the crystals? For what reason? Unable to locate the source of radiation. It has simply disappeared, Captain. True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter. Correct. Which would seem to be impossible. Perfect working condition. Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside. The possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain. Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an immense scale. Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion. Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, rational. Almost as if he were two men. Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass. The cut on his forehead. First he has it, then it's gone, then he has it again. Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him. Jim, madness has no purpose or reason, but it may have a goal. He must be stopped, held. Destroyed if necessary. Two parallel universes project this. One positive, the other negative. Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter. Precisely. Under certain conditions, when two identical particles of matter and antimatter meet Annihilation, Jim. Total, complete, absolute annihilation. Lazarus. A trick to get the crystals. Spock to Bridge. Lazarus. Take these crystals to the Enterprise. What of Lazarus? There is, of course, no escape for them, sir. Captain, the universe is safe."

As we both know, I'm a bright young medic with a miraculous touch. Why then, when I returned, there wasn't a trace of that wound on his forehead. Not even a bruise.

Stand by. You just did a complete life survey five minutes ago. How are you just picking it up now? Well, what is it, this object? Its physical makeup? And its appearance coincided with this cosmic winking-out? SPOCK; Almost to the second. Explanation. Speculation. Could this being present any danger to the ship? Lieutenant Uhura, notify Security to have an armed detachment of men ready to beam down with us. Let's go. Any word comes through from Starfleet Command, pipe it down immediately. Communications, priority one. Captain's log, stardate 3087.6. While investigating an uncharted planet, the Enterprise and at least this entire quadrant of space, has been subjected to violent, unexplained stress and force. Sensors have reported the presence of a human being on the planet below who might be connected with the phenomenon. With my first officer and a security team, I have set out in search of him. Yes. You have a talent for understatement, Lieutenant. Without full crystal power, our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours. Re-amplify immediately. Any further magnetic disturbance? Nothing? Keep checking. Repeat. Invasion status. All hands, this is the Captain. Battle stations. I repeat, battle stations. This is no drill. Kirk here. Yes, Doctor, quickly. I'll talk to him later. Thank you. Kirk out. Kirk here. Enterprise standing by, Commodore. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I have considered all the alternatives. My best guess is it could be a prelude to invasion. I see. You mean, we're the bait. Thank you, sir. Maintain alert status at all battle stations. From the top, Mister Spock. First, the phenomenon came from the planet below. Secondly, the danger is apparently real and imminent. Yes. Meanwhile, I'll talk to our unexpected guest. Maybe he can provide some answers. You say this one man Thing destroyed your entire civilisation. How did you escape? Before we picked you up, our ship sustained a number of incredible effects. Is he the thing that attacked you? We don't have any other facts, any information. My only cause is the safety of my ship and the mission we're on. You'll beam down with me and I'll check your story out. Spock, find anything? According to him, there's a creature of some sort down here, a humanoid. Let's have it. The truth this time. Can you identify that? Lazarus! You stay here. All personnel, security red. Lazarus, what happened? Let's get out of here. Let's get back to the ship. Any luck? If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said Hard to believe. But the rest of his story seems to fit. His wounds testify to an apparent confrontation with something. Assuming there is a humanoid, a something, how does he do it? He has no weapons, no power. You tell me. That's why you brought me down here, isn't it. Right. Bones, I've got a lot of things to do. Get to the point. Where is he? Lazarus, are you all right? No. I have a ship's physician with a strange sense of humour. Go. Find something? On my way. Lazarus, you're with me. Bones, if I had time, I'd laugh. How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before? Another riddle? First Doctor McCoy, then you? But it is there. A what? What do the crystals have to do with it? All they show us the point of radiation. Out of the question. Those crystals are the very heart of the power of my ship. How? Now you tell me how. All I've heard is double-talk, lies, threats, accusations that don't hold water. Now you tell me, how it presents a danger to my ship? Don't threaten me, Lazarus. Lieutenant, can you prepare an experimentation chamber in ten minutes? All dilithium crystals, full power. Lieutenant, what is it? What's wrong? Lieutenant? Fact. You said you needed the crystals. Fact. An hour after you said you must have them, they were missing. Fact. Two of my crewmen were attacked. How'd this beast get aboard my ship? No. He didn't transport up. A report would've been made. Sit down. The crystals certainly aren't here. There's an unexplained radiation source on the planet. Obviously some connection. We'll check it out. Organise a search party immediately. Mister Lazarus will beam down with us. You may not have reason to thank me, depending on what we find. I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship. Mister Spock? Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise. I want every inch of this terrain checked. Look for footprints, movement, anything. Call out if you spot anything. Don't be afraid to use your weapons. You saved my life down there. I want to thank you. I have some questions I want to ask you. It's necessary. This is a computer report of the evidence you gave at your first screening. It calls you a liar, Lazarus. For one thing, there's no planet at the location you said you came from. There never has been. If you want help from us, you'd better start telling the truth. Try us. I'll have the truth now. What are you saying? And this thing you search for is a time traveler, too? Lazarus, you're hurt. I know. I sympathise, but I've got four hundred and thirty other men to worry about. Now where are those crystals? Dismissed. Sometimes pain can drive a man harder than pleasure. I'm sure you know that, Doctor. What have we got, Mister Spock? A magnetic effect which produces a winking-out phenomenon. A mysterious, unidentified source of radiation on the planet. Lazarus, a walking powder keg. Your rip in the universe. A so-called murdering humanoid. But by using those instruments you were unable to identify the source of the radiation on the planet. Are the instruments in order? Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative. The source of radiation is not from our universe. Outside? Yes, that would explain a lot. Another universe, perhaps in another dimension, occupying the same space at the same time. All right. What would happen if another universe, say a minus universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours? Which is what we've been experiencing. The point where they come into contact, couldn't that be described as a hole? Or what is outside to enter. The invasion that Commodore Barstow suspected. But a small scale invasion, Mister Spock. What is your analysis of the mental state of Lazarus? Yes, two men. Different, but identical. And a hole in the universe. No, not a hole, A door. Take a look at Lazarus. One minute he's at the point of death, the next he's alive, well, strong as a bull. Which is physically impossible for one man. What's going on? This leaping from universe to universe. This wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilisations What's the purpose? I don't follow you. Do you know what you're saying? Matter and antimatter have a tendency to cancel each other out. violently. Like Lazarus. Identical. Like both Lazarus', only one is matter and the other antimatter. If they meet. Of everything that exists, everywhere. All available personnel, on the double. Spock, with me. Report. He's probably beaming down with the crystals right now. I'm going after him. You organise a security detail. Follow me as soon as you can. Energise. Lazarus. No, him. Not completely. This is a parallel universe? Antimatter? And if identical particles meet He has two more. Exactly what did I pass through? This corridor, is it what caused the magnetic effect, the winking out phenomenon? And the universe is safe. Surely Lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet face to face outside the corridor. So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster. The creature. I understand. What do you want me to do? You can't hold him forever. If I destroy his ship, won't yours also be destroyed? And your door will be closed. You'll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever. At each other's throats throughout time. I'm ready. Stand back. I must destroy that ship completely. And what of Lazarus? Activate phaser banks. Stand by to fire. Fire phasers. All right, Mister Lesley, let's get out of here. Ahead warp factor one. Everything's all right, Mister Spock, for us. There is, of course, no escape. How would it be? Trapped forever with a raging madman at your throat until time itself came to a stop? For eternity. How would it be? For you and me. But what of Lazarus? What of Lazarus? <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

3562,TOS,episode 27,BARSTOW,"You're aware of the effect an hour ago? You may not be aware of its scope. It occurred in every quadrant of the galaxy and far beyond. Complete disruption of normal magnetic and gravimetric fields, timewarp distortion, possible radiation variations. And all of them centring on the general area which you are now patrolling. The question is, are these natural phenomena or are they mechanically created, and if they are, by whom? For what purpose? Your guess, Captain. Exactly our consensus. I'm giving you the job of finding out specifically. KIRK; Aye, aye, sir. Can you assign me other starships as a reserve? Negative. I'm evacuating all Starfleet units and personnel within a hundred parsecs of your position. It's going to be tough on you and the Enterprise, but that's the job you've drawn. You're on your own. Good luck."
3563,TOS,episode 27,LAZARUS,"You came! Thank the heavens. There's still time. It's not too late. We can still stop him. But I, but I, need, need your help. That's how I came to be down there, Captain, pursuing the devil's own spawn, a thing I've chased across the universe. He's humanoid outside, but inside, he's a hideous, murdering monster. I'll get him, Captain. I swear it. Not man! Thing. To the last man, woman and child. I was inspecting magnetic communications satellites. You believe me, don't you? That was he! He's death, anti-life, he lives to destroy. Yes. I give you my word. I swear it. Then you'll join me in my holy cause? Help me in visiting justice and vengeance upon him. Captain, you yourself said there were no other explanations. Why do you give credence to this man? No! You've come back in, is it? Well, don't stop. Here I am. Come at me again. We'll finish it! Come! Come! It'll do you no good. I'll chase you to the very fires of hell! I saw it again. The thing. It attacked me. I told you it was a thing. All white, black and empty. A terrible emptiness. He'll kill us all if we don't kill him first! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Captain's log, stardate 3088.3. We continue to orbit the dead planet, which seems to be the source of the phenomenon which has struck the Enterprise and all sections of the galaxy once again. As for Lazarus, the story he tells me about the humanoid continues to trouble me. Yes. But impatient. Have you decided to help me yet? Is something wrong? Yes! That's it! The dilithium crystals. With their power we could do it. Yes. We've got him, Captain, we've got him. That's just it, that's the key. That's the way to trap him. That's the solution. Captain, I beg of you. I plead, I demand. Give me the crystals. You fool! There won't be any ship if we don't kill him. He'll destroy all of you. I warn you, Captain. You'll give me the crystals. No threat intended. Captain, I'll have my vengeance. And fact, Captain. I didn't take the crystals. I'm not the one. Find my enemy, find the beast, and you'll find the crystals. He did. Isn't that enough? I tell you we're dealing with a creature capable of destroying worlds. For the same reason that I do. Listen to me. He's humanoid. Why, he he can pilot a spaceship. He can compute formulas to destroy races. He can steal an energy source for his vehicle so he can escape from me. Are you deaf as well as blind? Thank you, Captain. What do you believe now, Captain? Captain, look out! The thing, the thing. The rock, I Aches. Why shouldn't I? Go ahead. It's all right. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. All right. I distorted a fact in the interest of self-preservation, for my holy cause. I needed help, not censure. Freedom, not captivity for being a madman. I was afraid that's what you'd call me if I told you the truth. My planet, my Earth, or what's left of it, is down there beneath us. My spaceship is more than just that. It's a time chamber, a time-ship, and I. I am a time traveller. Oh, yes. He's fled me across all the years, all the empty years to a dead future on a murdered planet he destroyed. Help me! Give me the tools I need to kill him! The crystals! Don't let him get away! Don't let him get away. I told you, he's got them. He took them. The thing! The thing! Oh, I didn't know. I'll get you now. I have a threshold. Run, run. I'll get you now. It's done, it's done! Finished, finished. It's done. It's done. It's done, it's done. Done. No! Don't! Not you! No! Welcome, Captain. I wasn't expecting you. Yes, him. You understand. Of course. Here, yes. The end of everything. Civilisation, existence, all gone. I tried to stop him, Captain. That's why I took your dilithium crystals. That's very bad, Captain. If he comes through at a time of his own choosing. But I think if we hurry and you will help me, he can yet still be stopped. There's little time left. He meant to come through. When you accidentally passed through, it drained his crystals. It'll take him about ten minutes to re-energise with the equipment aboard his ship. That should give us enough time. That's hard to explain, Captain. I call it an alternative warp. It's sort of a negative magnetic corridor where the two parallel universes meet. It's sort of a safety valve. It keeps eternity from blowing up. Precisely, Captain, but not because of its existence. Because, because my foe entered. The corridor is like a prison, with explosives at the door. Open the door, and the explosives might go off. Stay inside Both universes, Captain. Yours and mine. Of course he knows, Captain, but he's mad. You heard him. He's lost his mind. When our people found a way to slip through the warp and prove another universe, an identical one, existed, it was too much for him. He could not live knowing that I lived. He became obsessed with the idea of destroying me. The fact that it meant his own destruction, and everything else, meant nothing to him. Yes, Captain. Or he is. It depends on your point of view, doesn't it? It's ready, Captain. If we can force him into the corridor while I'm waiting for him, we can put an end to this. But if he comes through at a time of his own choosing and breaks into this universe to find me Find him. Force him through his threshold, while I'm waiting for him, into the corridor, and I'll hold him there. Can't I, Captain? You destroy his ship. It will. Yes, and so will his. Is it such a large price to pay for the safety of two universes? Send him to me. I'll be waiting. No! No! No, I'm not ready! I'm not ready!"
3564,TOS,episode 27,MASTERS,"Report on the dilithium crystals, Captain. Whatever that phenomenon was, it drained almost all of our crystals completely. It could mean trouble. Aye aye, sir.  Hi. Coffee? I know what you mean. Re-amplification finished on the dilithium crystals? Masters here. I'll check, sir. Captain. The chamber will be ready in ten minutes, sir. My assistant and I will Captain! Captain! The energiser has shorted. Get out of here. Sound the alarm. No, I've got to stay Engineering calling Bridge. Fire! Fire in the energising circuit."

All plotted but one, Captain. Coming up on it now. Seems to be fairly heavy displacement. The hypo, Captain. Empty. Confirmed by the library record tapes, Captain. Subjects failed to recognise acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that they were in mortal danger, and were seeking escape at any cost. Extremely dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the centre of the time disturbance. And of considerable age. On the order of ten thousand centuries old. Unbelievable, Captain. This single object is the source of all the time displacement. I can't. For this to do what it does is impossible by any science I understand. It is operating even now. Putting out waves and waves of time displacement, which we picked up millions of miles away. Incredible power. It can't be a machine as we understand mechanics. I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles. A time portal, Captain. A gateway to other times and dimensions, if I'm correct. Really. Relive the accident. This time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided. Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing, Captain. To step through on precisely the day we wish I am a fool. My tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed. I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever With no past, no future. I was recording images at the time McCoy left. A rather barbaric period in your American history. I believe I can approximate just when to jump. Perhaps within a month of the correct time. A week, if we're fortunate. There is no alternative. Seconds now, sir. Stand by. And now. It was called Depression, circa 1930. Quite barbaric. I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case, Captain. That should prove interesting. Fascinating. Theft, Captain? You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it. Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child. Oh, yes, it's quite untidy. Here, let me help you. Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer. First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but we can't be certain. There is a theory. There could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash. Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope. Frustrating. Locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival, even the images of what he did. If only I could tie this tricorder in with the ship's computers for just a few moments. In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture? At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth. My hobby. Yes, of course, Captain. Speculation. Gifted insight. We have a what, Captain? One might have said so in the first place. Captain, I must have some platinum. A small block would be sufficient, five or six pounds. By passing certain circuits through there to be used as a duodynetic field core... Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins. Captain. Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month, I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits. I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins. Captain. Tools for finely detailed work. I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been returned in the morning. Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler? I'll finish with the furnace. I may have found our focal point in time. Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our answer on this screen, Captain. And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing. I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex. Bad enough. It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article. Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary. Some sort of traffic accident. Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn to. Is the random element. Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know which. Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again, Edith Keeler must die? I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another attempt. Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits. This is how history went after McCoy changed it. Here, in the late 1930s. A growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War. While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its heavy-water experiments. Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the peace movement. She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world. And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim. We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry. Jim, Edith Keeler must die. Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop. I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died right there, had you not caught her. We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact time will come? Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and millions will die who did not die before. What is it? No, Jim! He knows, Doctor. He knows. We were successful."

Suddenly, it went dead. No static, just nothing. Captain, I'm frightened. Captain, it seems impossible. Even if you were able to find the right date Happiness at least, sir.

I won't let you! You won't get me! Murderers! Killers! Killers! Killers! I won't let you get me! I'll kill you first! I won't let you get me! Assassins! Murderers! Killers! Assassins! Murderers! Murderers! Assassins! You! What planet is this? No! Don't run! I won't kill you! It's they who do the killing! Don't run! I won't kill you! I'm glad you got away, too. Why do you think they want to kill us? Where? Where are we? Earth? The constellations seem right, but. Explain! Explain this trick. Biped. Small. Good cranial development. No doubt considerable human ancestry. Is that how you're able to fake all of this? Very good. Modern museum perfection. Right down to the cement beams. Very, very good. Oh, I'd give a lot to see the hospital. Probably needles and sutures. All the pain. They used to hand-cut and sew people like garments. Needles and sutures. Oh, the terrible pain! Oh, Miss. That coffee, it just smells wonderful. I can't. I got to keep moving. I can't let them find me. The most common question to ask would be, where am I? I don't think I'll ask it. The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm either unconscious or demented. This looks like old Earth around 1920 or 25. I am unconscious, or demented. I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist. I am Leonard McCoy, Senior Medical Officer aboard the Enterprise. It's quite all right. It's quite all right dear, because I don't believe in you, either. Come in. Thank you. No, not particularly. You know, I've convinced myself that this is all in a cordrazine hallucination, but I've decided you're not. But if you're not, what are you? I don't doubt it. What about this place? Do you run it? Why? Well, it was for me, at least. You may have saved my life. Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from. Allow me to show my gratitude. Perhaps there's something I can do around here to thank you. A who movie? Well, I know what a movie is, but. You deliberately stopped me, Jim. I could have saved her. Do you know what you just did?"

Nothing wrong with the communicator, sir. You mean we're stranded down here? Then even finding McCoy would be a miracle. Aye. Good luck, gentlemen. What happened, sir? You only left a moment ago."
3593,TOS,episode 28,KIRK,"Stay on top of it, Mister Sulu. Understood, Engineer. Mister Spock? We can't avoid these areas of turbulence. Sickbay. To the Bridge. Spock? Maintain orbit. Open the channel to Starfleet Command. Precautionary measure, Lieutenant. Broadcast to Starfleet Command my past week's log entries, starting with the unusual readings we had on the instruments and how they led us here. Inform Starfleet Command that apparently something or someone down on this planet Bones. Can effect changes in time, causing turbulent waves of space displacement. Tricky stuff. Are you sure you want to risk Who, me, Doctor? Mister Spock? Bones! Get back to your positions. It was set for cordrazine. Communications, emergency medical team. Security alert. Captain's log, supplemental entry. Two drops of cordrazine can save a man's life. A hundred times that amount has just accidentally been pumped into Doctor McCoy's body. In a strange, wild frenzy, he has fled the ship's Bridge. All connecting decks have been placed on alert. We have no way of knowing if the madness is permanent or temporary, or in what direction it will drive McCoy. Continue alert, decks four through eleven. The medical department knows as little as we do. In dosages approaching this, there's some record of wild paranoia. Bridge here. Go ahead. So whatever's down there, McCoy is in the heart of it. Set up a landing party. Let's go get him. Kirk out. These ruins extend to the horizon. Begin recording. Detail, fan out. What is this thing, Mister Spock? It seems to be pulsating with power of some kind. Analysis, please. That's funny. Explain. Then what is it? What are you? Are you machine or being? Annoyed, Spock? Spock! If that is a doorway back through time, could we somehow take Bones back a day in time, then Guardian. Can you change the speed at which yesterday passes? Strangely compelling, isn't it? To step through there and lose oneself in another world. Bones, no! Where is he? Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty. McCoy has somehow changed history. Earth's not there. At least, not the Earth we know. We're totally alone. Captain's log, no stardate. For us, time does not exist. McCoy, back somewhere in the past, has effected a change in the course of time. All Earth history has been changed. There is no starship Enterprise. We have only one chance. We have asked the Guardian to show us Earth's history again. Spock and I will go back into time ourselves and attempt to set right what ever it was that McCoy changed. Make sure we arrive before McCoy got there. It's vital we stop him before he does whatever it was that changed all history. Guardian, if we are successful Scotty, when you think you've waited long enough. Each of you will have to try it. Even if you fail, at least you'll be alive in some past world somewhere. I've seen old photographs of this period. An economic upheaval had occurred. We seem to be costumed a little out of step with the time. Well, Mister Spock, if we can't disguise you, we'll find some way of explaining you. Let's get out of here. Well, we'll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later. I think I'm going to like this century. Simple, easier to manage. We're not going to have any difficulty explaining You're a police officer. I recognise the traditional accoutrements. My friend is obviously Chinese. I see you've noticed the ears. They're actually easy to explain. The unfortunate accident he had as a child. He caught his head in a mechanical rice picker. But fortunately, there was an American missionary living close by who was actually a skilled plastic surgeon in civilian life. Oh, how careless of your wife to let you go out that way. You were actually enjoying my predicament back there. At times, you seem quite human. Sorry. Time we faced the unpleasant facts. Arrives where? Honolulu, Boise, San Diego? Why not Outer Mongolia, for that matter? And the same currents that swept McCoy to a certain time and place might sweep us there, too. Couldn't you build some form of computer aid here? Yes, well, it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic, Mister Spock. Excuse me. I sometimes expect too much of you. Excuse us, miss. We didn't mean to trespass. It's cold outside. No. We were being chased by a policeman. These clothes. We stole them. We didn't have any money. Mine is Jim Kirk. His is Spock. Excuse me, Miss. Where are we? Do you run this place? Radio tubes and so on. I approve of hobbies, Mister Spock. Why? Shut up. Shut up. I want to hear what she has to say. Development of atomic power is years away, and space flight years after that. I find her most uncommon, Mister Spock. Then we can report back for other work? A what? Oh. Thank you. We have a flop. A place to sleep. Mister Spock, I've brought you some assorted vegetables, baloney in a hard roll for myself, and I've spent the other nine tenths of our combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for you. Mister Spock, this bag does not contain platinum, silver or gold, nor is it likely to in the near future. McCoy'll be along in a few days, perhaps sooner. There's no guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together. This has to work. Your hat. If Mister Spock says that he needs the tools and that they'll be returned tomorrow morning, you can bet your reputation on that, Miss Keeler. We served together. Let me help. A hundred years or so from now, I believe, a famous novelist will write a classic using that theme. He'll recommend those three words even over I love you. Silly question. Want to hear a silly answer? A planet circling that far left star in Orion's belt. See? How are the stone knives and bearskins? I think you may also find you have a connection burning someplace. Good. Let's see what you have. February 23rd, 1936. Six years from now. The President and Edith Keeler conferred for some time today How bad? The President and Edith Keeler. We know her future. Within six years from now, she'll become very important. Nationally famous. You must be mistaken. They both can't be true. She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she lives or dies, all of history will be changed. And McCoy In his condition, what does he do? Does he kill her? Get this thing fixed. We must find out before McCoy arrives. How do you know? And make them spend it on life? The very same. How long before we get a full answer? McCoy could have been in the city a week now for all we know, and whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen tonight or tomorrow morning. I must know whether she lives or dies, Spock. I must know what to do. Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They won the Second World War. But she was right. Peace was the way. No. How did she die? What day? Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler. Edith. With ulterior motives. Does that please you? No, of course you didn't. It's not yet time. McCoy isn't here. What? McCoy! Leonard McCoy? Stay right here. Spock! Stay right there! McCoy! He's in Edith. Let's get the hell out of here. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® is copyright of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Fifteen cents an hour for ten hours a day. What are your names? I'm Edith Keeler. You can start by cleaning up down here. You're in the 21st Street Mission. Indeed I do, Mister Kirk. Good evening. Now, as I'm sure somebody out there has said, it's time to pay for the soup. Now, let's start by getting one thing straight. I'm not a do-gooder. If you're a bum, if you can't break off of the booze or whatever it is that makes you a bad risk, then get out. Now I don't pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love when every day is just a struggle to survive, but I do insist that you do survive because the days and the years ahead are worth living for. One day soon man is going to be able to harness incredible energies, maybe even the atom. Energies that could ultimately hurl us to other worlds in some sort of spaceship. And the men that reach out into space will be able to find ways to feed the hungry millions of the world and to cure their diseases. They will be able to find a way to give each man hope and a common future, and those are the days worth living for. Our deserts will bloom. Prepare for tomorrow. Get ready. Don't give up. Mister Kirk. You are uncommon workmen. That basement looks like it's been scrubbed and polished. Yes. Seven o'clock in the morning. Do you have a flop for the night? You really are new at this, aren't you? A flop is a place to sleep. There's a vacant room at the place where I live for two dollars a week. If you want to I'll take you there. Good. If you can leave immediately, I can get you five hours work at twenty two cents an hour. What? What on Earth is that? That toolbox was locked with a combination lock and you opened it like a real pro. Why did you do it? I'm sorry, I can't On one condition. Walk me home? I still have a few questions I'd like to ask about you two. Oh, and don't give me that questions about little old us? look. You know as well as I do how out of place you two are around here. You? At his side, as if you've always been there and always will. And you? You belong in another place. I don't know where or how. I'll figure it out eventually. Captain. Even when he doesn't say it, he does. Why does Spock call you Captain? Were you in the war together? And you don't want to talk about it? Why? Did you do something wrong? Are you afraid of something? Whatever it is, let me help. Centuries from now? Who is he? Where does he come from er, where will he come from? Yes. Why? What is so funny about man reaching for the moon? I just know, that's all. I feel it. And more, I think that one day they'll take all the money they spend now on war and death Yes. You see the same things that I do. We speak the same language. You look terrible! You'd better sit down. Come on. There's a cot in the back room. They won't find you there. Come on. Hey, now, come on. You're not ready to take on any tigers just yet. Lie down. Why not? Would you care to try for 30? I have a friend that talks about Earth the same way that you do. Would you like to meet him? I don't mean to disbelieve you, but that's hardly a Navy uniform. Get some rest. Are you following me, sir? I hope it means Oh! How stupid! I've been up and down those stairs a thousand times. I could have broken my neck. Well, you look just fine, Doctor. I thought you might like to see the evening paper. That's reassuring. A friend. When you showed up here, you looked like you could use one. I try to. It's necessary. Lots of people drink from the wrong bottle sometimes. We can talk about that later. I have to go. My young man is taking me to a Clark Gable movie. A Clark Gable. Don't you know? That's very strange. You get some rest. I'll see you later. If we hurry, maybe we can catch the Clark Gable movie at the Orpheum. You know, Doctor McCoy said the same thing. Yes. He's in the Mission. He's"

3805,TOS,episode 29,SPOCK,"As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy. Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient civilisations. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning. Two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept by mass insanity, then Theta Cygni Twelve. The last was Ingraham B, two years ago. The ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain. He does not seem to be out of control. His course is straight for the sun. Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and rising. So are we. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. The sun's gravimetric pull increasing. All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level. Planet development is normal, Captain. Originally colonised as a freighting-line base in this area. No Federation contacts for over a year. Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals. Sensors report the expected number of humans on the planet surface. However, they are strangely quiet. Very little activity. They're here, Captain. In the buildings. Strangely quiescent. Captain, several people approaching. Indeed. They seemed most concerned for our safety. Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions. Captain, I understand how you must Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in. Obviously they were not entirely successful. That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it. The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out. A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it. Incredible. Not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers, it does not even register on my tricorder. It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously alive, it exists. Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard. No! No! No, I won't. I must take the ship. Down! I must take it down. Doctor McCoy. Captain. These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your sedatives, Doctor. I'll be able to return to duty. I apologise for my weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship. I simply did not understand. What is there to understand, Mister Spock? I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can be controlled. It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me. It wants this ship, but I am resisting. I have my own will, Captain. Let me help. I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain. I was. I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down to the same co-ordinates as before. That is an order, Mister Scott. Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by me. One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed, Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me. I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed. Thank you, Captain. Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting. Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable, but I assure you I'm all right. Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting, gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell. Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain? And although it is not physically connected to the other cells, it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons. From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain. Yes, sir. I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more. Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew. Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people. I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me. Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness. It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity. It converts matter to energy. A possibility. Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium. Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch. If this works, the satellites we orbit will produce light of such intensity that even someone in a closed, darkened area will be affected by it. Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the logical choice. There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor. The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain. And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you. Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see. Doctor it was my selection as well. It is done. An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix. Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me. My pleasure, Captain. Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy."

3813,TOS,episode 29,MCCOY,"There's no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets. Jim. There's one possibility. The mass insanity may have reached this planet, too. Jim, your brother Sam and his family, aren't they stationed on this planet? Captain's log stardate 3287.2. The mass insanity we have tracked across this section of the galaxy seems to have already touched Deneva. That planet, colonised over a century ago, is one of the most beautiful in the galaxy. Jim, did you know who that woman was? There's something wrong, Jim. Their nervous systems. Unconscious like this, there should be just routine autonomic activity, but I'm getting a very high reading, as though even in their unconscious state, they're being violently stimulated. Is this your brother, Jim? I'm sorry, Jim. The boy's unconscious, but he's still alive. I'd better get the boy and his mother back to the ship. I can't do much for them down here. McCoy to Enterprise. Prepare to beam up party of four. Ready to beam up, Captain. I'd like you to be onboard when your sister-in-law regains consciousness. I won't be able to give you the exact cause until I get the plates back from the lab. They're both in extreme pain. I sedated them heavily. But your sister-in-law seems to have a high tolerance. The tranquilliser hasn't affected her much. Yes. When she answers questions, any questions, it's as if she's fighting to get the answers out. As though something is exerting pain to stop her. Nurse. That's the second time he's come out of it. Either he's fighting us, or something inside of him is fighting us. Let's prepare to close. Nurse! Miss Chapel. Miss Chapel, if you cannot assist me as required, call another nurse in here. But do one or the other now. To be very frank, Jim, I don't know that I can do anything for Spock or your nephew. They're pieces of some form of living tissue. I removed one from Spock's spinal cord, the other from your sister-in-law's body. They're both the same. The boy's too weak to touch. Besides, removal of the tissue wouldn't stop the pain anyhow as far as I can tell. No. I just removed these for examination. His body's full of these tentacles, entwining and growing all about his nervous system. The same. Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a stinger much like a bee or wasp, leaving one of these in the victim's body. It takes over the victim very rapidly, and the entwining is far, far too involved for conventional surgery to remove. I'm sorry, Jim. The lab, the science departments, we're all stumped. The K3 indicator registers the level of pain. Watch as I turn it on. That's what he's been going through. I've never seen anything like it. No wonder the poor devils go mad. Who knows, Jim? I know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him, but whether he can control it hour to hour Yes. Jim, aren't you forgetting something? There are over a million colonists on that planet down there, just as much your responsibility. They need your help, too. Jim, this is ridiculous. I don't want my patients running around. He should be in bed. Jim, that man is sick. Don't give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job. You may be controlling the pain, Mister Spock, but you're far from all right. I'm sorry, Captain. I've tried everything I can. Variant radiation, intense heat, even as great as nine thousand degrees. Which happens to be my point. The thing won't die, even at temperatures and radiation which would burn Spock and your nephew to ashes. Captain, I understand your concern. Your affection for Spock, the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brother's family. Gentlemen, I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of destroying over a million people. If killing five people saves ten, it's a bargain. Is that your simple logic, Mister Spock? I'm sorry, Jim. We've been over and over it, made every conceivable test. Jim, we've been through it and through it. Radiation, heat Nothing lethal about light. You can't move Deneva closer to the sun, Jim. Well, I can rig a test cubicle in the bio-lab, put our specimen in it. But I don't Put on your masks. Completed. It worked! We can do it. What's the matter, Jim? We can do it. Well, I don't know. Maybe trial But I'd have to put a Do you have any idea of the risk? Do you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerves? All right. I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles. Unfortunately, you're both right. It's the only thing we can do. All right, Mister Spock. Mister Spock's the best first officer in the fleet. Completed. Oh, no. I threw the total spectrum of light at the creature. It wasn't necessary. I didn't stop to think that only one kind of light might've killed it. I didn't need to throw the blinding white light at all, Jim. Spock, I McCoy here. Yes, Captain. He'll be happy to hear that. The blindness was temporary, Jim. There's something about his optical nerves which aren't the same as a human's. 'Tis a pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty, Mister Spock. Unusual eye arrangement. I might've known he'd turn up with something like that. I said, please don't tell Spock I said he was the best first officer in the fleet."

Aye, they make regular trips from here carrying supplies to the asteroid belt for the miners and bringing cargo out. I've made the run a couple of times myself as an engineering advisor. None, sir. Just that noise we heard. Mister Spock, I thought you were still confined to Sickbay. Here, now. Where do you think you're going? Not likely, Mister Spock. Aye, sir, and I'm sorry I have to disobey it. The Captain said no one was to transport down. Mister Spock. Freeze right there, Mister Spock, or I'll put you to sleep for sure. This is Mister Scott in the transporter room. Get me the Captain. He said he was transporting down to the surface, sir. Your orders were that no one was to beam down unless you authorised it.

Bones, what's your theory about the cause of all this? But it follows a definite pattern, a systematic progression from planet to planet. Plot an interception course, Mister Sulu. Warp factor eight. Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact that ship. Scotty, tractor beams? Denevan ship, this is the Enterprise. Can you reverse your course? Acknowledge. Keep closing. Denevan ship, reverse your course. Do you hear me? Reverse your course. Acknowledge. Reverse course. One hundred and eighty degrees about. Very well. Reduce to sub-warp speed. Take us to Deneva. That Denevan ship headed deliberately into the sun. Why? Keep trying. Put it on audio. Aurelan, this is Jim on the Enterprise. Repeat your message. Re-establish. I'm not interested in your excuses, Lieutenant. Re-establish contact with that transmitter. Keep trying to raise them. Yes. You were right a while back. My brother Sam lives on Deneva. He's a research biologist. That woman sounded like his wife Aurelan. Set your phasers on stun. We're going to beam directly into the capital city. Alert status. Mister Spock. I'll want a complete transcript of everything that happens down there, Yeoman. Let's go. Energise. There are almost a million inhabitants of Deneva. There's more than one hundred thousand in this city alone. Where is everyone? My brother's lab is over there. They signalled us once. There should be someone there. Let's find out what's happening. Stand by to fire. Fire. Did you hear what they said, Mister Spock? They tried to brain us with these clubs. Check them out, Bones. To say the least. Fan out. Follow me. Security. Aurelan. Bones. Aurelan, you're safe now. Sam. It is my brother. Was my brother. Peter? Get ready to beam up. Yes. Yes, Mister Spock. You heard my sister-in-law say something about they being here. Your guess. It doesn't make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported. Our sensors didn't pick up anything that didn't belong here. Take charge of the landing party, Mister Spock. I want some answers to all this. Can she talk? Aurelan? Aurelan, it's Jim. He's dead. But your son's still alive. You've got to help us. Yes, I'm here. You have to tell us what happened, Aurelan, to you and the others. Who? What kind of things? Aurelan, it's important that you tell us. What kind of things? Report.  You've seen some kind of creature? Any alien form? All right. Let's go find out what it is. Set your phasers on force three, to kill. We're looking for some kind of creature, and we already know it will kill. Spock! Form a ring. Fire! And it can bear up under full phaser power. It's too close in here. It may be a trap in here. Let's move out. Spock! Spock! It's gone. Can you stand? Spock, are you all right? Captain's log supplemental. Whatever the creatures are, they have apparently taken over all the inhabitants of Deneva. Meanwhile, ship's surgeon Doctor McCoy is examining a strange puncture wound left by one of the creatures on Mister Spock's back. How is he? Did you operate on Spock in time? My nephew? Recommendations? All decks, security alert. Locate and restrain Mister Spock. He may be dangerous. Use phasers on stun if necessary. Get him back to the Sickbay. Use security restraints. Spock. You're only half-Vulcan. What about the human half of you? Can he control it the way he says, Bones? I need you, Spock, but we can't take any chances. We'll keep you confined for a while longer. If you can maintain control, we'll see. My nephew. If he regains consciousness, will he go through that? Help them. I don't care what it takes or costs. You've got to help them. Mister Spock, I gave you an order to stay in the Sickbay. Scotty? Mister Spock, your logic, as usual, is inescapable. Beam him down. Stay in constant touch with us. Give him your phaser. He'll need that, too. Energise. I don't have to, Bones. We both know he is. Yes. That would answer a lot of questions. I think so. This may be one cell in a larger organism. An incredibly huge organism, in fact. Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it, that it may have come here, planet by planet, from an entirely different galaxy. But not impossible, Mister Spock. The Denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free, that he'd won. That's the angle to work on, gentlemen. I want an analysis of all this from Medical and Life Science departments within the hour. Then you're wasting your time. There has to be something that'll kill the creature without destroying the human host. I can't accept that, Bones. We've got fourteen science labs aboard this ship. The finest equipment and computers in the galaxy. No, no, Bones. There's more than two lives at stake here. I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying a million people down there. Captain's log, stardate 3289.8. I am faced with the most difficult decision of my life. Unless we find a way to destroy the creatures without killing their human hosts, my command responsibilities will force me to kill over a million people. Gentlemen. I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen. I cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet, nor do I intend to kill a million or more people to stop it. I want another answer. I'm putting you gentlemen on the hot seat with me. I want that third alternative. Report. Request denied. Request denied. There must be another answer. Something in the sun killed that thing before the Denevan died. All right. All right. We've tried heat, radiation. What other qualities or properties does the sun have? But one other thing you haven't mentioned. It's bright. It radiates a blinding light if you're close enough. Not to us. But down on the surface, the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part. Suppose they weren't simply hiding. Suppose they're sensitive to light. Light, like in a sun, close up. No, but you can move the equivalent of the sun to Deneva. Mister Spock? Good. Let's get on it. Your figures are, of course, accurate. It worked in a lab. With the creature exposed to everything we can give it. But what about the people who are infected? Maybe. There's no time for maybes, Bones. We need to know now. Yes, we'd have to put someone who's infected under that light. We have to duplicate the conditions on the planet, and Spock There's no other way, Bones. We have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the Denevan declared himself freed. I agree completely. Proceed. Spock, are you all right? What is it? Are you telling me that Spock need not have been blinded? Bones, take care of him. Good. Scanners? Satellite control, this is the Captain. Energise all satellites. Report. Sickbay. Tell Spock it worked. Bones, it wasn't your fault. Bones. Bones. Yeoman, record this for Starfleet Command. The alien creatures on Deneva have been destroyed Spock. You can see. Mister Spock. Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most. You, I presume, felt nothing? If you gentlemen are finished, would you mind laying in a course for Starbase Ten, Mister Spock? What's that, Doctor? You've been so concerned about his Vulcan eyes, Doctor, you forgot about his Vulcan ears. Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu."

On our present course you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of but two point eight light days. I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that you answer it. Yes or no. It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers. You have my request, Captain. Will you grant it or not? Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated. No. Nothing of that nature, Captain. No! I must. I wish to take my leave on Vulcan. I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer. Thank you, Captain. No. We're not. Captain's log, stardate 3372.7. On course, on schedule, bound for Altair Six via Vulcan. First Officer Spock seems to be under stress. He has requested and been granted shore leave. Ship surgeon McCoy has him under medical surveillance. I quite understand, Captain. Changed the course? No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible. Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know why, nor do I remember doing it. Captain, lock me away. I do not wish to be seen. I cannot. No Vulcan could explain further. Ask me no further questions. I will not answer. Sickbay? My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor. I have done so. And now I'll go to my quarters. Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us. Come. It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who have been involved. A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of it among ourselves. It is a deeply personal thing. Can you see that, Captain, and understand? Captain, there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service. It has to do with biology. Biology. Vulcan biology. The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain. If they were, if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us. How do Vulcans choose their mates? Haven't you wondered? No. No. It is not. We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity. You humans have no conception. It strips our minds from us. It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation. It is the pon farr. The time of mating. There are precedents in nature, Captain. The giant eelbirds of Regulus Five, once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched. On your Earth, the salmon. They must return to that one stream where they were born, to spawn or die in trying. No. Nor am I a man. I'm a Vulcan. I'd hoped I would be spared this, but the ancient drives are too strong. Eventually, they catch up with us, and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take a wife. Or die. Let me alone. Let me alone! Miss Chapel. I had a most startling dream. You were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't hear you. It would be illogical for us to protest against our natures. Don't you think? Your face is wet. Vulcan. Miss Chapel. Yes, I know, Christine. Would you make me some of that plomeek soup? It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor. My compliments on your insight. Captain, there is a thing that happens to Vulcans at this time. Almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find distasteful. Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with me? There is a brief ceremony. It is my right. By tradition, the male is accompanied by his closest friends. I also request McCoy accompany me. This is Spock. T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched. We meet at the appointed place. She is T'Pring. My wife. This is the land of my family. It has been held by us for more than two thousand Earth years. This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee, The marriage party approaches. I hear them. By our parents' arrangement. A ceremony while we were but seven years of age. Less than a marriage but more than a betrothal. One touches the other in order to feel each other's thoughts. In this way our minds were locked together, so that at the proper time, we would both be drawn to Koon-ut-kal-if-fee. They are not outworlders. They are my friends. I am permitted this. This is Kirk. With my life, T'Pau. T'Pau. My friend does not understand. He does not know. I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with him! His blood does not burn. He is my friend! I burn, T'Pau. My eyes are flame. My heart is flame. Thee has the power, T'Pau. In the name of my fathers, forbid. Forbid! T'Pau. I plead with thee! I beg! Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes. You will instruct Mister Chekov to plot a course for the nearest Starbase where I must surrender myself to the authorities. T'Pring. Explain. Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your champion. I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me. Logical. Flawlessly logical. Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true. Spock here. Stand by to beam up. Live long, T'Pau, and prosper. I shall do neither. I have killed my captain and my friend. Energize. Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course. So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements. Doctor, please, let me finish. There can be no excuse for the crime of which I'm guilty. I intend to offer no defence. Furthermore, I shall order Mister Scott to take immediate command of this vessel. Captain! Jim! I'm pleased to see you, Captain. You seem uninjured. I am at something of a loss to understand it, however. Indeed. Ah, yes, the girl. Most interesting. It must have been the combat. When I thought I had killed the captain, I found I had lost all interest in T'Pring. The madness was gone. Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain. Thank you, Captain. Thank you, Doctor."

4043,TOS,episode 30,MCCOY,"Oh, Captain. Got a minute? It's Spock. Have you noticed anything strange about him? Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint without an examination, but he's become increasingly restive. If he were not a Vulcan, I'd almost say nervous. And for another thing, he's avoiding food. I checked and he hasn't eaten at all in three days. Miss Chapel. Captain. What's this? Oh! Vulcan plomeek soup, and I'll bet you made it too. You never give up hoping, do you? It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel. Jim, when I suggested to Spock that it was time for his routine check-up, your logical, unemotional first officer turned to me and said, you will cease to pry into my personal matters, Doctor, or I shall certainly break your neck. Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you. My orders were to give you a thorough physical. In case you hadn't noticed, I have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do. Come on, Spock. Yield to the logic of the situation. Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan. No! Now. Right away. If you don't get him to Vulcan within a week eight days at the outside, he'll die. He'll die, Jim. I don't know. There's a growing imbalance of body functions, as if in our bodies huge amounts of adrenalin were constantly being pumped into our bloodstreams. Now, I can't trace it down in my biocomps. Spock won't tell me what it is. But if it isn't stopped somehow, the physical and emotional pressures will simply kill him. He does, and he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran Shellmouth. No use to ask him, Jim. He won't talk. Well, that's that. You can't go off to Vulcan against Starfleet orders. You'll be busted I shall be honoured, sir. He called it Koon-ut what? And they still go mad at this time. Perhaps the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time. Yeah. Hot as Vulcan. Now I understand what that phrase means. I wonder when his T'Pring arrives. T'Pau. Officiating at Spock's wedding? Leonard McCoy, ma'am. With him? Ma'am, I don't understand. Are you trying to say that she rejected him? That she doesn't want him? I doubt it. Not in his present condition. You can't do it, Jim. No. She said their laws and customs were not binding on you. In this climate? If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will. You can't do it! Jim, listen, if you These men are friends. To force them to fight until one of them is killed Spock! No! Is this Vulcan chivalry? The air's too hot and thin for Kirk. He's not used to it. I can compensate for the atmosphere and the temperature with this. At least it'll give Kirk a fighting chance. You're going to have to kill him, Jim. It's a tri-ox compound. It'll help you breathe. Now be careful! McCoy to Enterprise. Have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party. As strange as it may seem, Mister Spock, you're in command now. Any orders? Spock, I Spock, I Nurse, would you mind, please? Spock, what happened down there? The girl? The wedding? There's just one thing, Mister Spock. You can't tell me that when you first saw Jim alive that you weren't on the verge of giving us an emotional scene that would have brought the house down. . Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical. In a pig's eye!"

4049,TOS,episode 30,KIRK,"A minute. No, nothing in particular. Why ? That just sounds like Mister Spock in one of his contemplative phases. Bones, I'm a busy man. Spock said that? Spock, what the devil is this all about? All right, Spock, let's have it. I'm more interested in your request for shore leave. In all the years In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a leave of any sort. In fact, you've refused them. Why now? Agreed, but that isn't the question, is it? If there's a problem of some sort, illness in the family Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore facilities there are excellent Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong? Bridge. Helm. Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four. I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible. Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message. Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance. Head directly for Altair Six. Sailor's luck, Mister Spock. Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it, 'Any home port the ship makes ill be somebody else's, not mine'. The new president of Altair Six wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early. Don't worry. I'll see that you get your leave as soon as we're finished. Bridge. Navigation. Mister Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mister Spock? How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us? Thank you, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out. Mister Spock. Come with me, please. Deck five. You've changed course for Vulcan, Mister Spock. Why? Do you deny it? Then why'd you do it? I'm trying to help you, Spock. I order you to report to the Sickbay. Complete examination. McCoy's waiting. Bones, I will, I will. As soon as this mission is Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain. You keep saying that. Are you a doctor, or aren't you? You say you're convinced he knows what it is? Stay. McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition. He says you're going to die unless something is done. What? Is it something only your planet can do for you? Spock! You've been called the best first officer in the fleet. That's an enormous asset to me. If I have to lose that first officer, I want to know why. No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order. Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential? What? What kind of biology? You mean the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction? Well, there's no need to be embarrassed about it, Mister Spock. It happens to the birds and the bees. I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically. But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're I haven't heard a word you've said, and I'll get you to Vulcan somehow. Lieutenant, get me Admiral Komack at Starfleet Command, Sector Nine. Pipe it down to McCoy's office. I'm aware of that, sir, but it's of the utmost importance. You must give me permission to divert to Vulcan. I can't, sir, but believe me, I wouldn't make such a request Sir, the delay would be, at most, a day. I can hardly believe that No, it's not. I know the Altair situation. We would be one of three starships. Very impressive, very diplomatic, but it's simply not that vital. I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to Altair. I owe him my life a dozen times over. Isn't that worth a career? He's my friend. Bridge. Navigation. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Vulcan. Tell Engineering I want warp eight or better. Push her for all she'll take. I see. Very well. Carry on, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out. Bridge. Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness. Is it permitted? Thank you, Mister Spock. Open the channel, Lieutenant. Vulcan Space Central, this is the Enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit. He described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge. In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates. It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler. The atmosphere is thinner than Earth. Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife. Bones, you know who that is? T'Pau. The only person to ever turn down a seat on the Federation Council. He never mentioned that his family was this important. Ma'am. What is it? What happened? Spock? We'll stay. Think Spock can take him? What happens to Spock if I decline? I can't? And you said Spock might not be able to handle him. If I can knock Spock out without really hurting him If I get into any trouble, I'll quit. And Spock wins, and honour is satisfied. Bones. He's my first officer and my friend. I disregarded Starfleet orders to bring him here. Another thing, that's T'Pau of Vulcan. All of Vulcan in one package. How can I back out in front of her? I accept the challenge. What do you mean, if both survive? Now wait a minute, ma'am. Who said anything about a fight to the death? Kill Spock? That's not what I came to Vulcan for, is it? What's that? Sound medical advice. Don't you think you better check with me first? Blame McCoy. That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with. He slipped in a neural paralyser. Knocked me out, simulated death. Kirk here. Relay it, Lieutenant. Well, a little late, but I'm glad they're seeing it our way. How about that T'Pau? They couldn't turn her down. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Altair Six. Leave orbit when ready. Kirk out. Yes, Mister Spock. I understand. Come on, Spock. Let's go mind the store. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

That area is just putting itself together after a long interplanetary conflict. This inauguration will stabilise the entire Altair system. Our appearance there is a demonstration of friendship and strength which will cause ripples clear to the Klingon Empire. You will proceed to Altair Six as ordered. You have your orders. Starfleet out."
4252,TOS,episode 30,T'PAU,"Spock, are our ceremonies for outworlders? And thee are called? Thee names these out worlders friends. How does thee pledge their behaviour? What they are about to see comes down from the time of the beginning, without change. This is the Vulcan heart. This is the Vulcan soul. This is our way. Kah-if-farr. She chooses the challenge. He acts only if cowardice is seen. She will choose her champion. Do not attempt to speak with him, Kirk. He is deep in the plak-tow, the blood fever. He will not speak with thee again until he has passed through what is to come. If thee wishes to depart, thee may leave now. Spock chose his friends well. He will have to fight for her. It is her right. T'Pring, thee has chosen the kal-if-fee, the challenge. Thee are prepared to become the property of the victor? Spock, does thee accept the challenge according to our laws and customs? T'Pring, thee will choose thy champion. Be silent. Kroykah! Kirk? T'Pring is within her rights, but our laws and customs are not binding on thee. Thee are free to decline with no harm on thyself. Thee speaks? The choice has been made, Spock. It is up to him now. It is said thy Vulcan blood is thin. Are thee Vulcan or are thee human? Thee has prided thyself on thy Vulcan heritage. It is decided. Another champion will be selected. Do not interfere, Kirk. Keep thy place. It is done. Kirk, decide. Here begins the act of combat for possession of the woman, T'Pring. As it was at the time of the beginning, so it is now. Bring forth the lirpa. If both survive the lirpa, combat will continue with the ahn woon. This combat is to the death. I can forgive such a display only once. Challenge was given and lawfully accepted. It has begun. Let no one interfere. Kroykah! The air is the air. What can be done? Thee may proceed. The ahn woon. Kroykah! MCCOY; Get your hands off of him, Spock! He's finished. He's dead. I grieve with thee. Live long and prosper, Spock."

4254,TOS,episode 30,T'PRING,"Spock, it is I. Spock, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched. I await you. Kal-if-fee! I am prepared. As it was in the dawn of our days, as it is today, as it will be for all tomorrows, I make my choice. This one. Specify. Stonn wanted me, I wanted him. You have become much known among our people, Spock. Almost a legend. And as the years went by, I came to know that I did not want to be the consort of a legend. But by the laws of our people, I could only divorce you by the kal-if-fee. There was also Stonn, who wanted very much to be my consort, and I wanted him. If your Captain were victor, he would not want me, and so I would have Stonn. If you were victor you would free me because I had dared to challenge, and again I would have Stonn. But if you did not free me, it would be the same. For you would be gone, and I would have your name and your property, and Stonn would still be there. I am honoured."

In all respects, quite ordinary, Captain. Momentarily. Negative, Captain. Not living tissue. Not a projection, sir. A field of energy. The ship is almost completely encircled by the field. It resembles a conventional force field but on unusual wavelengths. Despite its appearance, that of a human appendage, it is definitely not living tissue. It is energy. Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven. Screen on, Captain. Verbose, isn't he? Insults are effective only where emotion is present. Try to break through it, Lieutenant. Very efficient. Mister Sulu, rig all transmission circuits for maximum power generation. Compute for reversal of polarity of the field around the ship. Lieutenant Kyle, I want a complete sensor scan of the planet. Locate all the lifeforms. I want to know what's going on down there. Ready to reverse polarity, Mister Sulu? Activate all units. Cut power, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, we must restore communications with the landing party. Oh? Good. Do so. Sensor report, Mister Kyle. And Apollo? Origin? I would suggest, Mister Sulu, if you cannot find out where the power source is, you should find out where it is not. A simple process of elimination. Progress report. Speed is essential, Lieutenant. I can think no one better equipped to handle it, Miss Uhura. Please proceed. Progress, Mister Sulu? Continue the search. Mister Kyle. We're unable to break completely loose from this force field, but we might be able to punch some holes through it. To shoot through. It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's communications problem. Take these equations to the nuclear electronics lab. I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in selected areas. That might be done by generating a strong pinpoint charge of M-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them in with the combined output of all our engines. Spock here, Captain. We've pinpointed a power source on the planet's surface which seems to have something to do with the force field. Is there a structure of some sort near you? The power emanates from there. We can negate sections of it, creating openings through which we can fire our phaser banks. Spock, Captain. Sensors are picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area. Captain, you're too close. More power to the shields. All banks maintain firing rate."

Mister Spock, I can't contact the landing party. All frequencies are jammed. Aye, sir. I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this. I might be able to rig up a subspace bypass circuit. I'm connecting the bypass circuit now, sir. It should take another half hour. Mister Spock, I haven't done anything like this in years. If it isn't done just right, I could blow the entire communications system. It's very delicate work, sir. Yes, sir. Right away. I think we can try it now, sir. Enterprise to Captain Kirk.

And he thinks he's the right man for her, but I'm not sure she thinks he's the right man. On the other hand, she's a woman. All woman. One day she'll find the right man and off she'll go, out of the service. What in the name of? Sickbay reports five minor injuries, all being treated. Sure it's wise, Jim? Well, you're the A and A officer, aren't you? Archaeology, anthropology, ancient civilisations. We're going to need help in all those areas. Simple humanoid, Captain. To coin a phrase, fascinating. I can't say much till I check our these readings. He looks human, but of course that doesn't mean a thing. Yes? You have a theory? What? May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship? Stunned but coming around. I'm not sure it's wise to let her go off like that. You saw how capricious he is. Benevolent one minute, angry the next. One more wrong move from her and he could kill her. Scotty doesn't believe in gods. Yes. To the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early Greece, creatures like that would have been gods. Not the whole encyclopaedia, Chekov. Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim. Number one on our list of things to do. Yes, except my estimation for his physical condition. In spite of Apollo's bag of tricks, he comes up essentially normal with just a few variations. However, there's an extra organ in his chest that I can't even make a guess about. Jim. Not good. Severe shock. Chekov, give me a hand. How do you feel? Some neural damage. Makes sense. The trouble with overworking him is that it can get us killed. I still say it can get us killed. Kill a deer. That's the funniest thing I ever heard. Any more good ideas, Jim? Well, it doesn't serve any other purpose I know of. What the devil is that? I wish we hadn't had to do this."

Helm doesn't answer. We can't move. Captain's log, stardate 3468.1. While approaching Pollux Four, a planet in the Beta Geminorum system, the Enterprise has been stopped in space by an unknown force of some kind. Aye, aye, sir. Applying thrust, sir. No results, Captain. We're stuck tight. Aye, aye, sir. Standing by. Ineffective, Captain. There doesn't seem to be anything to push against. Working, sir. Computed and standing by to generate, sir. No good, Mister Spock. We didn't even faze it. We're still locked tight. Mister Spock, here's something. There seems to be a radiated energy pulsation coming from the planet. I don't know what it is, sir. I can't seem to pinpoint it. The whole planet, sir? Yes, sir. The whole planet. Sectors one through twenty five charted and examined. No chance at all of power originating in those areas. Aye, sir. Fourteen B by twenty six index. All phaser banks, fire! All phaser banks, maintain firing rate! Maintaining, sir."

External pressure building up, Captain. Eight hundred and climbing. One thousand and climbing. Becoming critical, Captain. We can't handle it. Pressure is gone, Captain. Space normal on hull. Power is what he controls. You can't do tricks like that without energy. I would like to point out that we are quite capable of some wrath ourselves. Leave her alone. And so do you. She's not going with you. I am tingling all over. Did he take her with him? Captain, we've got to stop him. He wants her. The way he looks at her. I'm able, sir. Aye, aye, sir. Aye. Unquestionably, an immensely powerful field of energy is being generated around here somewhere. We're just having difficulty focusing on it. You bloodthirsty Saracen, what have you done with her? I can't get my arm to move. Captain, we've got to do something! Carolyn. What's happened to her? Captain, we've got to wait until Carolyn comes back before we fire on the temple. We don't know what would happen to her if he was suddenly attacked. She might get killed. Captain, we've got to go and find her! But what if he doesn't. What if he Captain!"
4285,TOS,episode 31,KIRK,"Bugs the? Well, carry out the standard procedures on Pollux Four. Bones, could you get that excited over a cup of coffee? Why, Bones? Scotty's a good man. I like to think of it not so much losing an officer as gaining Actually, I'm losing an officer. Cartographic Detail, stand by. Preliminary reports, Mister Spock. Cartographic Sections, implement standard orders. Analysis, Mister Spock. What is it, Mister Spock? Is it a hand? A trick, then? A projection? Hard about. Reverse all engines. Lieutenant, relay our position and circumstances to Starbase Twelve immediately. Mister Sulu try rocking the ship. Full impulse power forward and back. Thank you. Mister Sulu? Mister Spock. Status. Thank you. Mister Sulu. Our forward tractor beams, adjust to repel. Activate. Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock. Response frequencies, Lieutenant. This is Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the Enterprise. Please identify yourself. Are you responsible for stopping the ship? Give it back, then we'll talk. I don't know who or what you are, but I must warn you we have the power to defend ourselves. If you value your safety, release this ship. Never mind the history lesson. Release the ship! Compensate. All right! Whatever you're doing, turn it off! You win! Let's go, Bones. You in good voice? If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell where this ship used to be. Insulted, Spock? Good. We'll tackle him together. We already know the questions. You're the best man to find the answers. Tricorders. Come on. You know of Earth? You've been there? You mentioned Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus. How do you know about them? Mister Chekov. And you haven't yet. Readings, Doctor. Evidently not so simple. All right. We're here at your invitation. Would you mind telling us what you want without all the Olympian generalities? Transporter room. Enterprise, come in. What is it you want? If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your business, but you're no god to us, Mister. And you've got a lot to learn! Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo? And this thing? I think the appearance of this is for our benefit. Bones? Fine, but what power, and where is it? Scout around with your tricorders. Find the source of that power. Bones. Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo? Apollo, we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks. I have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there. Scotty. Very impressive. How'd you do it? Bones, how is he? He would have been rather difficult to stop. Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation. How do you feel, Scotty? It would seem so. Mister Scott, I understand your concern over her, but she volunteered to go with him, hopefully to find out more about him. She's doing her job. I think it's about time you started doing yours. We've got to find out the source of his power. You've got a tricorder. Use it if you're able to. And one more thing. I want no more unauthorised action against Apollo or whatever he is. That's an order! Besides, you stiff-necked thistle head, you could have gotten yourself killed. Apollo's no god. But he could have been taken for one, though, once. Say five thousand years ago, a highly sophisticated group of space travellers landed on Earth around the Mediterranean. Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and command great energy. In fact, they couldn't have been taken for anything else. I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir. Apollo has no difficulty focusing. He taps that energy, Mister Scott. Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps a flow of energy and channels it through his body? Mister Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week. But where is the source of that power? Is that all you have to offer? Bones, is it possible Where's Lieutenant Palamas? Scotty! All right, mister. You wanted worshippers? You've got enemies. You want us to bow down, you'll have to Take care of Scotty. Where's Apollo? Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat? All right, all right, all right. Very good, Mister Chekov. That might very well mean something. We've got to get out of here. Well, let's assume that five thousand years ago creatures like our friend Apollo did indeed visit Earth and form the basis of the Greek classic myths. Most mythology has its basis in fact. If I remember my ancient legends, the gods, after expending energy, required rest, even as we humans. Something like that. Remember, he's keeping a force field on the ship and he's expending energy down here. You said he looked pained and tired when he disappeared. If we can wear him out, overwork him, that might do it. If we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again, there's a chance that he'll be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him. Not all of us, Bones. When he comes back, it's a chance we'll have to take. You know nothing about our kind. You know only our remote ancestors who trembled before your tricks. Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you. We've come a long way in five thousand years. Mankind has no need for gods. We find the one quite adequate. We're busy. Look after the girl. Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking! Lieutenant, get back. We're tired of your phony fireworks! Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Lieutenant. And you will supply the herds of sheep, and the pipes we'll play, and the simple skins we'll wear for clothes. We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved us. Yes, I have. One more. And it depends on the lieutenant's loyalty. If she fails us, we'd better get used to herding goats. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Scotty, I'll find out. How old are you? Then I'd better handle it. You all right? Come over there. Well? All right, Lieutenant, you can come down from Mount Olympus now. You've got work to do. He thrives on love, worship, attention. We can't give him that worship, none of us can. Especially you. Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him. Lieutenant. All our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you. On you, Lieutenant! Reject him, and we have a chance to save ourselves. Accept him, and you condemn all of us to slavery, nothing less than slavery. We might never get help this far out. Or perhaps the thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals to you. Give me your hand. Your hand. Now feel that. Human flesh against human flesh. We're the same. We share the same history, the same heritage, the same lives. We're tied together beyond any untying. Man or woman, it makes no difference. We're human. We couldn't escape from each other even if we wanted to. That's how you do it, Lieutenant. By remembering who and what you are. A bit of flesh and blood afloat in a universe without end. The only thing that's truly yours is the rest of humanity. That's where our duty lies. Do you understand me? Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty. Kirk here. There is indeed, Mister Spock. Very good. How are you doing on the force field? Well, that ought to do it. Have Sulu lock all phaser banks onto the structure. Fire on my order only. Cut it fine. We'll be standing nearby. ]Bridge]SPOCK I'd love to oblige you, Mister Spock, but we're not all together. Besides, we have Apollo to deal with. If that structure is the source of his power, I want to know where he is when we attack it. Kirk out. Bones, do you think that mysterious organ in Apollo's chest could have something to do with the transmission of energy? Yes, I know. I know. Scotty. We'll wait. Kirk here. Stand by your phasers, Mister Spock. Prepare to fire on my signal. Kirk out. We've got to be here when he comes back. Scotty, just hold on! All right. The temple is his power source. Let's bring him back to it. Get to cover. Mister Spock, fire those phasers. Fire those phasers! That's an order, Mister Spock! Scotty! We've out grown you. You asked for something we could no longer give. So do I. They gave us so much. The Greek civilisation, much of our culture and philosophy came from a worship of those beings. In a way, they began the Golden Age. Would it have hurt us, I wonder, just to have gathered a few laurel leaves? <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

You have left your plains and valleys and made this bold venture. So it was in the beginning. You have made me proud. Now you can rest. We shall remember together. We shall drink the sacramental wine. There shall be the music of the pipes. The long wait has ended. Yes. I caused the wind to withdraw from your sails. It has been five thousand years. Have you learned no patience in that time? You have the same fire. How like your fathers you are. Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus. You will obey me, lest I close my hand thus. hat was your first lesson. Remember it. Captain Kirk, I invite you and your officers to join me. But do not bring that one, the one with the pointed ears. He is much like Pan, and Pan always bored me. No sad faces. This is a time to rejoice, not to fear. You are returning home. Let your hearts prepare to sing. My children, long have I waited for this moment. The memories you bring of your lush and beautiful Earth, the green fields and blue skies, the simple shepherds and their flocks. Once I stretched out my hand, and Earth trembled. And I breathed upon it, and spring returned. Search your most distant memories, those of the thousands of years past, and I am there. Your fathers knew me, and your father's fathers. I am Apollo. Earth, mother of the most beautiful of women in the universe. That at least has not changed. I am pleased. Yes, my children. Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite, Artemis. A gallant band of travellers. We knew your Earth well, five thousand of your years ago. You will not leave this place. Your transportation device no longer functions. I will not permit that device to work, either, Captain. You will worship me, as your fathers did before you. I said you would worship me. And so have you! Let the lesson begin! Welcome to Olympus, Captain Kirk. I want from you that which is rightfully mine. Your loyalty, your tribute, and your worship. Life in paradise. As simple and as pleasureful as it was those thousands of years ago on that beautiful planet so far away. Agamemnon was one such as you, and Hercules. Pride and arrogance. They defied me until they felt my wrath. No, you do not, Captain. They are mine. To save, to cherish, or to destroy at my will. How like Aphrodite and Athena. The beauty, grace. And you seem wise for a woman. What is your name? I mean your name. Carolyn. Yes. You are beautiful. You would do Aphrodite credit. I will tell you a thousand tales, stories of courage and love. You will know what it is to be a goddess. You protest? You risk much. I've grown weary of discussion and argument. None of your toys will function. Yes. You are a beauty. But like Artemis, the bow arm should be bare. Yes. Come. He shall learn the discipline of the temple. So shall you all. Come. Without fear. She is fit indeed. I've known other women. Daphne, Cassandra, but none more beautiful than you. Are you frightened of me? A god? They returned to the cosmos on the wings of the wind. No, not as you understand it. We're immortal, we gods. But the Earth changed. Your fathers changed. They turned away until we were only memories. A god cannot survive as a memory. We need love, admiration, worship, as you need food. In a real sense, we were gods. We had the power of life and death. We could have struck out from Olympus and destroyed. We have no wish to destroy, so we came home again. It was an empty place without worshippers, but we had no strength to leave, so we waited, all of us, through the long years. Even for a god, there's a point of no return. Hera was first. She stood in front of the temple and spread herself upon the wind, thinner and thinner, until only the wind remained. But I knew you would come. You striving, bickering, foolishly brave humans. I knew you would come to the stars one day. Of all the gods, I knew and I waited, waited for you to come and sit by my side. Even five thousand years ago, the gods took mortals to them to love, to care for, like Zeus took Leto, my mother. We were gods of passion, of love. She is no longer of any concern to you. You will learn discipline. You will learn Come here! I know you're trying to escape me. It's useless. I know everything you do. I tried to be compassionate toward your kind. But you're of the same nature. I could sweep you out of existence with a wave of my hand and bring you back again. I can give life or death. What else does mankind demand of its gods? We shall not debate, mortal. I offer you eternal rest and happiness according to the ancient ways. I ask little in return, but what I ask for I insist upon. Approach me. I said approach me! You will gather laurel leaves, light the ancient fires, kill a deer, make your sacrifices to me. Apollo has spoken! You shall reap the rewards of your insolence! Mortal, you have earned this! I shall be lenient with you, for her sake. You will make plans to bring the rest of your people down. Be sure your artisans bring tools. You will need homes. You will dismantle your ship for the supplies you need, and I'll crush its empty hull. I have been too patient. I shall be patient no longer. Fools. I offer them more than they could know. Not just a world, but all that makes it up. Man thinks he's progressed. They're wrong. He's merely forgotten those things which gave life meaning. You'll all be provided for, cared for, happy. There is an order of things in this universe. Your species has denied it. I come to restore it. And for you, because you have the sensitivity to understand, I offer you more than your wildest dreams have ever imagined. You'll become the mother of a new race of gods. You'll inspire the universe. All men will revere you almost as a god yourself. And I shall love you for time without end, worlds without end. You shall complete me, and I you. My what? I am Apollo. I've chosen you. Your work? I don't believe it. You love me. Carolyn! I forbid you to go. I order you to stay. No! Stop! Stop, I say! Stop! Stop, I say! I command it! Stop! Stop! Stop! I would have cherished you, cared for you. I would have loved you as a father loves his children. Did I ask so much? Carolyn, I loved you. I would have made a goddess of you. I've shown you my open heart. See what you've done to me. Zeus, Hermes, Hera, Aphrodite. You were right. Athena, you were right. The time has passed. There is no room for gods. Forgive me, my old friends. Take me. Take me."
4494,TOS,episode 31,CAROLYN,"Here's the report on Pollux Five, Captain. This entire system has been almost the same. A strange lack of intelligent life on the planets. It bugs the percentages. Aye, sir. Well, I was up all night working on this report, sir. All right, Scotty. Just let me give this to Mister Spock. What am I doing down here, Doctor? Correct. Apollo, twin brother of Artemis, son of the god Zeus and Leto, a mortal. He was the god of light and purity. He was skilled in the bow and lyre. Obviously he has some knowledge of Earth. His classical references and the appearance of all this. Captain. But why? What you've said so far makes no sense at all. Lieutenant Palamas. Carolyn. Oh, it's beautiful. It's all right, Captain. I'll go. Oh, it's lovely. Frightened? No, I don't think so. Of course, a girl doesn't go walking with a All right, a god every day. What happened to the others? Artemis, Hera? You mean they died? You really think you're a god? But you said the others didn't die. I don't understand. Captain. No, don't! A father doesn't destroy his children. You said you were gentle and understanding. How can they worship you if you hurt them? Apollo, please. You know so much of love. Please don't hurt them. Please. Oh, yes, I'm all right. I have a message for you. He wants us to live in peace. He wants to provide for us. He'll give us everything we ever wanted, and he can do it, too. I don't understand. Yes? What? Yes. I love him. No, not on me. Oh, but you don't understand. He's kind, and he wants the best for us. And he's so lonely. What you ask would break his heart. How can I? Yes. Yes, I understand. He's calling me. Yes, sir. My orders and my duty. I must say, Apollo, the way you ape human behaviour is remarkable, but there are some other things I must know. Your evolutionary patterns and your social development. I'm sure they're unique. I've never encountered a specimen like you before. I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now. I'm a scientist. My particular specialty is ancient civilisations, relics, and myths. Surely you know I've only been studying you. Love you? Be logical. I'm not some simple shepherdess you can awe. Why, I could no more love you than I could love a new species of bacteria. Is that the secret of your power over women, the thunderbolts you throw?"

We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe, and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable radioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background radiation. Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the routine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene blood burn does not act that swiftly. An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain. Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to ninety of our photon torpedoes. I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power twenty percent. We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatter our shields completely. Approximately warp fifteen, Captain. Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range. Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres. No, sir. Holding steady. No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo. They are in good working order, Captain. Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit. Computing now, Captain. Weight, five hundred kilograms. Shape, roughly cylindrical. Length, a fraction over one metre. Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott. Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once. No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary. Fascinating. It would seem so, Captain. It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to communicate. Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out. Nomad? Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get through. A reasonable course. It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer. An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment. Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the series. But if this is that probe Chart 14A, sir? I believe the history computer can answer that question. I'll have the readout in a moment. The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory banks. I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe. True. Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself. This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time. His dream was to build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic. You recall his name. Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted. Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The unanswered question is, the other what? Nomad was a thinking machine, the best that could be engineered. It was a prototype. Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic. Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the auxiliary control room. That unit is a woman. Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the machine's capacity. Fascinating. Well, Doctor? Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage but only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated. Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere? Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have understood your anger. It has great technical skill, but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable. It almost qualifies as a life-form. The study of it would be of great use, Captain. An almost human stubbornness, Captain. I have been unable to convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis. Without its co-operation, I can do nothing. Thank you. It is not sufficient, Captain. I get certain references to the accident, the other, but nothing clear. There are areas I simply cannot scan. Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe. It seems the only way. There is a risk, but I have formed a partial hypothesis. I must check it out. I. Am. Nomad. I am performing my function. Deep emptiness, It approaches. Collision. Damage. Blackness. I. Am. The other. I am Tan Ru, Tan Ru. Nomad. Tan Ru. Error. Flaw. Imperfection. Must sterilise. Rebirth. We are complete. Much power. Gun ta. Noo. Icka. Tan Ru. The creator instructs. Search out. Identify. Sterilise imperfections. We are Nomad. We are Nomad. We are complete. We are instructed. Our purpose is clear. Sterilise imperfections. Sterilise imperfections. Nomad. Sterilise. Sterilise. Nomad, sterilise, Fascinating, Captain. The knowledge. The depth. It was, it was damaged in deep space. Undoubtedly, the meteor collision. Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them. It wandered without purpose, and then it met the other. The other was an alien probe of great power. Somehow they merged, repaired each other, became one. Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a prelude to colonisation. I beg your pardon? Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible. It's space-happy. It thinks I'm its mother. And that is the only thing that has saved us until now. Yes. Captain. I've examined the brig. The forcefield door on the security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished. I must assume they are dead. I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit. In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect. Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point, Earth. I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities. It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units. No response. Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has completed its re-evaluation. Undoubtedly. Your logic was impeccable, Captain. We are in grave danger. My congratulations, Captain. A dazzling display of logic. No, sir. Remarkable. The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain. It was a remarkable instrument. Sir?"

Captain, the message is coming in now. Doctor McCoy to the transporter room. Maintenance crew C5. Bridge to auxiliary control room. Check in, please. Mister Scott's engineers are working on them now. Report to him when your indicators are registering properly. Anything else? Holding. Where my heart is, Where my heart is. Somewhere beyond the stars. Beyond Antares. Where my heart is, Where a scented miracle Tomorrow the path along the way, There's where my love What? I don't know what it. Oh, my singing. I was singing. I don't know. I like to sing. I felt like music. See the dog. See the dog, R, r, run! The dog has a, The dog, The dog has a ball. All right, Christine. The ball is bl-u-ee. Bl-u-ey. Bluey?"

4518,TOS,episode 32,MCCOY,"They've got the co-ordinates, Jim. It's locked in. What do we do now, go up and knock? Jim, I don't think anybody's in there. Well, I'm not the Kirk. Tell me what your function is. Unstable infestation? The population of four planets? What kind of function Ridiculous. Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago. Of course. Jackson Roykirk. That's not the same. As I recall, it wasn't. It was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek new life-forms. He's dead, Jim. There's nothing I can do, Jim. If there's a chance, it'll have to be soon. Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain. We'd better give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as tracings of Scotty's hyperencephalogram. The body is in Sickbay. I could have told you that without looking. It's unbelievable. Take it easy. Lie down, Scotty. We just want to check you out. I'd like to check it out, if you don't mind. A man is not just a biological unit that you can patch together. Nurse, I want him prepared for a full physical examination. Yes. I'll get on it right away. Oh, and in spite of the way you repaired Scotty, you metal ticking That's a laugh. How's she doing? Well, she checks out with no brain damage. We've got all the educational tapes in our library. Now it's up to us. Captain Kirk to Sickbay. Emergency. I think so. Looks like some kind of shock. Nomad examined the personnel files and the medical histories. She tried to stop him. Yours. Jim, with all the systems out we'll only have enough air and heat for I thought you might like to know that Lieutenant Uhura is back to college level. She'll be back on the job within a week."

4523,TOS,episode 32,SCOTT,"Giving them all we got. Shields still holding, sir. I'm having to divert the warp engine power into the shields, sir, if you want the protection. Shields still holding, sir, but the drain on the engines is reaching the critical point. Ach, we lost warp manoeuvreing power. Switching to impulse. That's problematical, sir. What kind of intelligent creatures can exist in a thing that small? Captain, you're not really bringing that thing in here? Energising. In my opinion, that's a machine. What's your source of power? Aye, sir. Bridge to Captain. That mechanical beastie is up here. Lieutenant! Keep away from that What are the lot of you staring at me for? How did I get here? How did I That thing did something to Lieutenant Uhura! What did it do to me? Notify the captain. What are you doing here? Watch your panels, everyone. Watch that polymass. Roger, help with the interfactor. Leave that alone. Aye. How are you doing that? Throw your dampers. Cut your circuits, all of them. Impossible. It can't go that fast. Aye, sir. Bridge to Captain. Life support systems are out all over the ship. Manual override has been blocked. Source, Engineering. Aye, sir. Energising."
4524,TOS,episode 32,KIRK,"Any response from the Malurians, Lieutenant? What about the Federation science team working there? Doctor Manway had a special transmitter. They have to answer. That can't be. The last census reported a total inhabitation of more than four billion people. That's impossible. What could have happened? Any other possibilities? Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu. Full power to the shields, Mister Scott. All hands, Red Alert. Phaser banks stand by. Photon torpedoes to Condition Red, Condition Red. Good. Ninety? I think we can expect others, Lieutenant. Mister Spock, pinpoint the source. Mister Sulu, evasive manoeuvres. Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Patch in my log. Tell them what has happened. Tell them the entire Malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an unidentified force. Helmsmen, I said evasive manoeuvres. Scotty? Mister Spock, speed of those bolts. Then we can't out run them. Good, Scotty. You're doing the right thing. Source, Spock. That's our target, Mister Sulu. Prepare photon torpedo. Has the target changed location, Mister Spock? Ready photon torpedo number two, Mister Sulu. Fire. Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock . But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived? Lieutenant, try to make contact. Can we take it, Mister Scott? Anything, Lieutenant? Translator computer. All hailing frequencies open. To unidentified vessel. This is Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or any lifeforms. Please communicate with us. Any further readings, Mister Spock? Five hundred kilos and only one metre long? Put it on audio, Lieutenant. Analysis sector. Have them study and decode it. Can you decode it? Repeat what? The message I sent? This is Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy. We have no hostile intentions. We request identity. Tie in the ship's translator to the communication channel. Let them take it at their own speed. I guess they can take it faster than we give it. Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out. It is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size differential. We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship. Do you require any special conditions, any particular atmosphere or environment? Good. Hold your position. We're locked onto your co-ordinates. We'll beam you aboard. Do we have any choice, Scotty? Besides, once it's aboard, it won't be taking any more shots at us. Lieutenant, get a repair crew on that computer. Get Doctor McCoy down to the transporter room. Spock, you come with me. Scotty, you too. Energise. Sensor readings, Mister Spock. We are from the United Federation of Planets. If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of reference. It won't know more than it does now. If you care to leave your ship, we'll provide the necessary life support systems. Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s? I will bring them. This way. Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity. Spock, Bones, come with us. 14A. Nomad, can you scan that? This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol. Yes. Yes. Yes. What sterilisation procedure? Yes, he is. Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless. Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out for that. Did you destroy the Malurian system? Doctor. Why do you call me the creator? Well, I Mister Singh. Come here a moment. This unit will see to your needs. I'll be back in a moment. Gentlemen, come with me. You're on to something, Spock. What is it? Nomad was destroyed. I heard some lectures at the Academy on the Nomad probe. Its mission was essentially peaceful. Jackson Roykirk. Captain James Kirk. What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock? Its purpose was certainly altered. Its directive, to seek out and destroy biological infestations, could not have been programmed into it. If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a device which sooner or later must destroy us. Security. This is the captain. The mechanism we brought aboard is in the auxiliary control room. Have a security team meet me there in five minutes. Security, cancel that order. Implement a full search for the mechanism. All decks report to me here. Captain here. On my way, Scotty. Scotty! Bones. Why did you kill him? That unit was my Chief Engineer. Lieutenant. Lieutenant, are you all right? Sickbay. What did you do to her? Get Scott down below. He's dead. His biological functions have ceased. All right, Nomad. Repair the unit. It serves me as it is, Nomad. Repair it. Doctor McCoy will show you. Security. I want a twenty four hour, two man armed surveillance on Nomad. Pick it up in Sickbay. It's all right. Scotty, she's being taken care of. It's all right. Doctor McCoy will explain it to you. Nomad, come here. Repair that unit. You restored Scott. He had much more extensive damage. Bones? Yes. Nomad, you will go with these units. They will take you to a waiting area. Take it to the top security cell. It's a killer, Spock. I intend to render it harmless. Get down to the Brig. Run a full analysis on the mechanism. I want to know what makes that thing tick. SPOCK; Yes, sir. What's the problem? Nomad, you will allow Mister Spock to probe your memory banks and structure. Yes. Follow your instructions, Nomad. We've got to know about it, Spock. what makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection. Get into direct mental contact with that thing? You saw what it did to Uhura. Nomad, the unit Spock will touch you. It is not an attack. It is a form of communication. You will permit it. Spock. Spock! Nomad! You're in contact with the unit Spock. Stop! Stop! Spock. Spock? What does it mean, we are Nomad? Then it isn't Nomad? A changeling. An ancient Earth legend, Mister Spock. A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed the identity of the human child. So, it is to sterilise, and for sterilise read kill. And it has the power and sophistication to do it. Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible. It's space-happy. It thinks I'm its mother. Nomad, stop what you're doing. Scotty? You will destroy my ship. Its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power. Turn off your repair operation. Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there. You killed two of my Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are! I'm a biological unit, and I created you. Nomad, there are two men waiting outside. You will not harm them. They will escort you back to the waiting area. You will stay there. You will do nothing. I have given you new programming and you will implement it. Reevaluate? It was a foolish mistake. Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when it tapped the computers earlier? And we've shown it the way home. And when it gets there And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise. Captain's log, stardate 3541.9. The presence of Nomad aboard my ship has become nightmarish. Now it apparently means to return to Earth. Once there, it would automatically destroy all life. Manual controls. Is she all right? What happened? Whose history? And found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other biological units. Kirk here. Nomad. Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering. Nomad? Stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems. You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator. Nomad, I admit that biological units are imperfect, but a biological unit created you. No, you're not Nomad. You're an alien machine. Your programming tapes have been altered. But I am your creator. I created you? But I admit I'm imperfect. How could I have created such a perfect thing as you? Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect? You must sterilise in case of error? Everything that is in error must be sterilised. Nomad, I made an error in creating you. I did not create perfection. I created error. I am the Kirk, the creator? You are wrong! Jackson Roykirk, your creator, is dead. You have mistaken me for him. You are in error. You did not discover your mistake. You have made two errors. You are flawed and imperfect and you have not corrected by sterilisation. You have made three errors. You are flawed and imperfect! Execute your prime function! Now. Get those antigravs on it. We've got to get rid of it while it's trying to think. Scotty, the transporter room. Scotty, set the controls for deep space. Two ten, mark one. Nomad, you are imperfect! Exercise your prime function. Now! You didn't think I had it in me, did you Spock? Good, Bones, good. What? Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives. It's well gone. Besides, what are you feeling so badly about? It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son. Well, it thought I was its mother, didn't it? Do you think I'm completely without feelings, Mister Spock? You saw what it did for Scotty. What a doctor it would've made. My son, the doctor. Kind of gets you right there, doesn't it? <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

I am Nomad. I will scan your star charts. I have the capability of movement within your ship. Yes. You are from the third planet? A planet with one large natural satellite? The planet is called Earth? You are the creator, the Kirk. The sterilisation procedure against your ship was unnecessary. You are the Kirk, the creator. You programmed my function. This is one of your units, creator? It functions irrationally. My function is to probe for biological infestations, to destroy that which is not perfect. I am Nomad. Not the system, creator Kirk. Only the unstable biological infestation. It is my function. Is the usage incorrect? There was much damage in the accident. What is the meaning? What form of communication? For what purpose is singing? What is music? Think about music. The unit touched my screens. That unit is defective. Its thinking is chaotic. Absorbing it unsettled me. A mass of conflicting impulses. Will the creator effect repairs on the unit Scott? Insufficient response. Does the creator wish me to repair the unit? I require tapes on the structure. Proceed. Creator, the unit Scott is a primitive structure. Insufficient safeguards built in. Breakdown can occur from many causes. Self-maintenance systems of low reliability. Where is the unit Scott now? Show me Sickbay. The unit Scott is repaired. It will function correctly if your information to me was correct. Not possible. The unit Scott required simple structural repair. The knowledge banks of this unit have been wiped clean. Mister Spock is also one of your biological units, Creator? This unit is different. It is well-ordered. My screens are down. You may proceed. I will permit it, Creator. Acknowledged. This primitive matter-antimatter propulsion system is the main drive? Inefficiency exists in the antimatter input valve. I will effect repair. The energy release controls are also most inefficient. I shall effect repair. Is there a problem, Creator? I have increased engine efficiency fifty seven percent. Acknowledged. It is reversed as ordered, Creator. Creator, your biological units are inefficient. Non sequitur. Biological units are inherently inferior. This is an inconsistency. I am programmed to investigate. There is much to be considered before I return to launch point. I must re-evaluate. Stop. I am programmed to destroy those life-forms which are imperfect. These alterations will do so without destroying the vessel which surrounds them. It, too, is imperfect, but can be adjusted. I am perfect. I am Nomad. You are in error. You are a biological unit. You are imperfect. You are the Creator. You are the Creator. Answer unknown. I shall analyse. Analysis complete. Insufficient data to resolve problem, but my programming is whole. My purpose remains. I am Nomad. I am perfect. That which is imperfect must be sterilised. I shall continue. I shall return to launch point Earth. I shall sterilise. Error is inconsistent with my prime functions. Sterilisation is correction. There are no exceptions. The creation of perfection is no error. Your data is faulty. I am Nomad. I am perfect. You are the Creator. Error. Error. Error. Examine. I shall analyse error. Analyse error, Examine error. Error. Analyse error. Error. Faulty! Ready, sir? Faulty! Error. Error. Faulty! Faulty! Must sterilise. Sterilise,"

Status of mission, Captain? Standard procedure, Captain? Mister Sulu, you will programme phaser barrage on Halkan cities. Their military capability, Captain? Regrettable that this society has chosen suicide. Mister Kyle, you were instructed to compensate during the ion storm. Carelessness with the equipment cannot be tolerated. Your agoniser. Your agoniser, please. Mister Scott, the storm has caused some minor damage in your section. There are also injuries requiring your attention, Doctor. Well, gentlemen? Yes. Due to your error, Mister Kyle? Possibly a result of the severe storm. Captain, do you feel any abnormal effects? Planet's rotation is carrying primary target beyond arc of phaser lock. Lock on to secondary city. Captain? But we cannot expect their co-operation. They have refused the Empire. Command procedure dictates that we provide the customary example. A serious breach of orders, Captain. Captain, you've placed yourself in a most grave position. This conduct must be reported. I think not. Your authority on this ship is extremely limited, Captain. The four of you will remain her in the Brig and in custody until I discover how to return you to wherever it is you belong. KIRK2 I can answer none of your questions at this time. KIRK2 Apparently some kind of transposition has taken place. I find it extremely interesting. KIRK2 Fascinating. KIRK2 Captain, I am pleased that you frustrated Mister Chekov's plan. I should regret your death. I do not desire the captaincy. I much prefer my scientific duties. I am frankly content to be a lesser target. The agony booth is a most effective means of discipline. I presume you've ordered full duration. Indeed. His act warrants death. That is, of course, your affair. Captain, may I inquire if you intend to persist in your unusual course of action regarding the Halkans? They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire procedure. You cannot ignore the consequences. I do not threaten, Captain. I merely state facts. I have found you to be an excellent officer. Our missions together have been both successful and profitable. However, I shall not permit your aberrations to jeopardise my position. Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed. It is the logic of history. Captain, I do not wish to find myself opposing you, but if you continue on your present course, this confusing, inexplicable behaviour, I'm aware of that, Captain. I trust that you are aware of the reverse. Mister Spock, Captain. I have received a private communication from Starfleet Command. I am committing a breach of regulations by informing you of its contents. I am instructed to wait until planet dawn over principal target to permit you to carry out our mission. In that event, I am ordered to kill you and to proceed against the Halkans as the new captain of the Enterprise. Captain's log, stardate unknown. We are trapped in a savage, parallel universe from which we must escape within four hours, or I will face a death sentence at Mister Spock's hands. Computer? Explain computer activity in the engineering section. Who is conducting the research? What is the nature of the research? Why are you monitoring my communications, Mister Sulu? That is my concern. If I am successful, you see yourself a step nearer to the captaincy. I do not want to command the Enterprise, but if it should befall me, I suggest you remember that my operatives would avenge my death and some of them are Vulcans. Please restrict your movements, Captain. I shall make that decision. Since your return from the planet, you've behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner. I want to know why. I shall not waste time with you. You're too inflexible, too disciplined once you've made up your mind. But Doctor McCoy has a plenitude of human weaknesses, sentimental, soft. You may not tell me what I want to know, but he will. I have the phaser, Captain, and I do not intend to simply disappear as so many of your opponents have in the past. If you please. Sickbay. Yes, of course. The entire landing party. Captain, stand over there. Doctor, it is time for answers. Why did the captain let me live? Our minds are merging, Doctor. Our minds are one. I feel what you feel. I know what you know. I cut the transporter power. It was necessary to delay your beam-out until I could arrive. Take him. Engineering, re-activate main transporter circuits. You must return to your universe. I must have my captain back. I shall operate the transporter. You have two minutes and ten seconds. Approximately two hundred and forty years. The Empire shall be overthrown, of course. You have one minute and twenty three seconds. One man cannot summon the future. A man must also have the power. Indeed? It is time. Captain Kirk, I shall consider it. Welcome home, Captain. It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men. I assume they returned to their Enterprise at the same time you appeared here. Indeed, gentlemen. May I point out that I had an opportunity to observe your counterparts here quite closely. They were brutal, savage, unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every way, splendid examples of homo sapiens, the very flower of humanity. I found them quite refreshing. You've met her before, Captain? Your reaction, One of recognition."

You are away from your post, Mister. No storm damage, sir. All stations report normal. You're ordered to annihilate the Halkans unless they comply. No alternative. Yes, sir. Captain, I have the leader on the Halkan Council waiting on channel B. Yes, Captain. I've got a pretty good idea, sir. I'll do my best, sir. You aren't very persistent, Mister Sulu. The game has rules. You're ignoring them. I protest and you come back. You didn't come back. I was getting bored. Of course this isn't the time. I'm afraid I changed my mind. Again. So do you, Mister. So do you. Take over for me. Mister Scott, all clear. On my way to Sickbay."

Jim, What in blazes is this? An exchange. If we're here What about the Halkans? We can't let them be destroyed. Here. Here. What's this? And my Sickbay is a chamber of horrors. My assistants were betting on the tolerance of an injured man. How long it would take him to pass out from the pain. I'm a doctor, not an engineer. Jim, the way this ship is run, what kind of people are we in this universe? Jim, if we're here, what do you suppose our counterparts doing back in our universe? That ought to hold him for about six hours. Now it's up to the captain. Help me get him on the table. Well, come on. Help me get him on the table. He'll die without immediate treatment. We'll get home. This won't take long. {Marlena is still watching on the Tantalus screen.) Shut up? I can save his life. Do you want me to stop, Jim? It'll only take a minute. A little time, he'll live. I can't let him die, Jim. You get on to the transporter room. I'll be there in five minutes. I guarantee it. Now, go on, please. Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better. It gave him character. Of course almost any change would be a distinct improvement. I'm sure."

Is the captain here? Is Spock here? When the cat's away Phasers Locked on target A, Captain. Approaching optimum range. Commence fire, Captain? Captain? Shall I correct orbit to new firing position? Aye, sir. Secondary target now moving beyond our phaser lock. My security board has detected extensive use of computer, Mister Spock. I was about to inform you. It's not hard to guess the nature of your order from Starfleet Command. I suggest a connection. The captain suspects. He's working on escape or defence. Correct. It's your play. I hope you succeed, because the order would fall on me next and you know how Captain Kirk's enemies have a habit of disappearing. Now you're making sense. Any time's a good time. You take a lot of chances, Lieutenant. Mister Spock has orders to kill you, Captain. He will succeed, apparently. You will also appear to have killed him after a fierce battle. Regrettable, but it will leave me in command."
4765,TOS,episode 33,SCOTT,"Captain, what is all this? Aye. I did. Captain, the transporter chief mentioned a surge of power. The transporter lock might have been affected by the ion storm and we just materialised somewhere else. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. I've been ordered to check phaser couplings for possible damage by the storm. Captain's orders. Never mind. I'll attend to it. Phaser report, sir. No damage. Mister Sulu is Security Chief, like the ancient Gestapo. Mostly variations in instrumentation. Nothing I can't handle. Everything's exactly where it should be, except us. Not by myself. I'll need help. And you'd be too conspicuous. Now you're an engineer. I'll have to tap the power we need from the warp engines and balance it for the four of us. Captain? We can do it. We have to lay in the automatic transporter setting, but when we interrupt engine circuits to tie the power increase into the transporter, it'll show up on Sulu's security board. Of course, we'll only need a second. Scotty here, sir. We've got another deadline, too, sir. The two-way matter transmission affected the local field density between the universes, and it's increasing. We've got to move fast. Half hour at the most. We couldn't get out of here in a century. We're ready to bridge power from the engines to the transporter. You've got to get down there and free the board so we can lock in. Give me about ten minutes. I've got to complete a few more computations. Aye, sir. Hardly fifteen minutes, sir. The field density between the two universes is starting to close very fast. All laid in, sir. Come on, McCoy! We're taking a chance of not getting back home. Fourteen minutes. We've got to go! Captain, we've barely got ten minutes. It's working, sir. Five minutes, sir. The power's cut, sir. They're on to us. Aye, it's available. I can get us the power, but the automatic setting is linked to the transporter main. If we bypass, that means that someone has got to operate the controls manually. I'll stay, Captain. Jim. Aye, Captain. Captain, get in the chamber!"
4766,TOS,episode 33,KIRK,"We have shown the council historical proof that our missions are peaceful. I admire your ethics and hope to prove ours. Kirk to Enterprise. Report on magnetic storm, Mister Spock. Rough ride? Stand by to beam up landing party. Plot an extended orbit to clear disturbance. Kirk out. When may we resume discussion? But we won't. Consider that. Enterprise. Transporter room, energise. Spock was right. It was a rough trip. No change. None. Yes. Doctor McCoy, you'd better look us over. That was a rough beam-up. Mister Spock, have those transporter circuits checked. Not now. Not now. I don't know. It's our Enterprise but it isn't. Maybe Any of you feel dizzy when we were in the transporter beam? When we first materialised. It happened twice. First we were in our own transporter chamber, then we faded, and then when we finally materialised, we were here. Wherever this is. Yes, here. Not our universe, not our ship. Something parallel. A parallel universe co-existing with ours on another dimensional plane. Everything's duplicated, almost. Another Enterprise. Spock with a beard. Then our counterparts must have been transporting up at the exact same time. Similar storms on both universes disrupted the circuits. We're here, and they're on our Enterprise. Probably asking the same questions. Are we in another universe, and if so, how do we get back to our own? They'll use the computer, and we have to. Scotty, can you buy me some time. Get below and short out the main phaser couplings. They'll think the storm blew the stand-by circuits. Then get on this technology. It's all we have to work with if we want to get back home. The intercom may be monitored. Use your communicators for private messages. Subfrequency and scramble. Lieutenant. Get to your post. Run today's communication from Starfleet Command. I want to know my exact orders and options, if any. Bones. Uhura, you're the only one who can do it. I'll be right there. Bones. Let's take a look at the library. We have a lot to learn. Communications status. Stand by, Mister Sulu. Kirk here. Very good. Thank you, Mister Scott. Kirk out. No. Lieutenant Uhura, contact the Halkan council. I wish to talk to them again. This is a new race. They offer other things of value besides dilithium crystals. Put phasers on standby, Mister Sulu. I have my reasons, and I'll make them clear to you in my own good time. It is useless to resist us. You're at liberty to do so, Mister Spock. Yes, he did your job. Get him out of here. All right. You're working for me. You're in line. You might even make captain. Not on my ship. Yes, the booth. Carry on. It's called blood. Watch your step. The officers move up by assassination. Chekov tried it on me. Report on technology. Star readings? Let's find out where we stand. Computer. This is the Captain. Record security research, to be classified under my voice print or Mister Scott's. Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm. Correlate following hypothesis. Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power surge in the transporter circuits creating a momentary interdimensional contact with a parallel universe? At such a moment, could persons in each universe, in the act of beaming, transpose with their counterparts in the other universe? Could conditions necessary to such an event be created artificially using the ship's power? Record procedure. Scotty, can you do it? Let's find out. Computer. Read out official record of current command. Cancel. Now we know. Good. I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to distract Sulu, at your signal. Let's get back to our posts. Keep me advised. On our Enterprise. KIRK2 Why? Logical, as always, Mister Spock. I haven't decided. I said I haven't decided. You heard my orders. Is that a threat? Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans? Conquest is easy, control is not. We may have bitten off more than we can chew. Is my concern, not yours. You would find me a formidable enemy. Release Chekov. Confine him to quarters. He gambled, I won. I was preoccupied. . Further than that, if I'm successful. Kirk here. Yes. Yes, Mister Spock. And if I don't? I don't intend to kill him. No, but I'll avoid killing Spock. I'll get out of his way. Yes. It's not that bad. Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear him. How does Marlena want to fit in? Scotty. We have to get out of here within three hours. Spock has orders to kill me unless I complete the mission. Explain. How fast? If we miss? All right. I'll be in the transporter room in ten minutes. I'll meet you in Sickbay afterward. I've never seen perfection, but no woman could come closer to it. I still do. I've got to go. You don't have to do that. You could. I simply meant that you could be anything you want to be. You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not. Uhura?  Scotty's signal should be coming through any moment. You know what to do. Keep Sulu's attention off that board. Good luck. Kirk out. What are you doing? Are you going to shoot me now, Spock? I thought I had until dawn. Shoot. You're wasting time. You're running a big risk, Spock. How much time, Scotty? Everything laid in, Scotty? The time lag so the operator can get into the transporter chamber? He is very much like our own Mister Spock, isn't he? You've got that minute. What is this, Mister Sulu? Let's go, Bones. No longer. A friend. Activate the transporter. You saved us back at Sickbay with the Tantalus field. I can't. I'm sorry. Our power is balanced for four. There's no guarantee that we'll make it with five. All could die. Scotty? One is coming. I'd help you if I could, Marlena. Believe that. If you kill us, you'll still stay. Where's McCoy? Time, Scotty. Auxiliary. Can you bridge to your setup? One of us will have to stay. Get to the transporter chamber. You, too, Uhura. That's an order, Scotty. McCoy. You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock. In that time I have something to say. How long before the Halkan prediction of galactic revolt is realised? The inevitable outcome? The illogic of waste, Mister Spock. The waste of lives, potential, resources, time. I submit to you that your Empire is illogical because it cannot endure. I submit that you are illogical to be a willing part of it. If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic demand that you be a part of it? But one man can change the present. Be the captain of this Enterprise, Mister Spock. Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans and make it stick. Push till it gives. You can defend yourself better than any man in the fleet. What about it, Spock? In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible. What will it be? Past or future? Tyranny or freedom? It's up to you. In every revolution, there's one man with a vision. Spock. What I don't understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly? Probably. However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I read my Spocks correctly. What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that other universe. I always thought Spock was a bit of a pirate at heart. I'm not sure, but I think we've been insulted. Lieutenant, er, Lieutenant? All right, Lieutenant. Carry on. Uh, why do you ask? Oh, no. No, no. We haven't met before, exactly. She just seemed a nice, likable girl. I think we could become friends. It's possible. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

During an ion storm, my landing party has beamed back to the Enterprise and found it and the personnel aboard changed. The ship is subtly altered physically.

Wrongful use of that power, even to the extent of the taking of one life, would violate our history of total peace. To prevent that, we would die, Captain. As a race, if necessary. The council will meditate further, but do not be hopeful of any change. Captain, you do have the might to force the crystals from us, of course. Captain, you've placed yourself in a most grave position. This conduct must be reported."

I'm surprised you could be caught off-guard that way. You're still in trouble with Starfleet Command. What you've got in mind this time is beyond me. You're scheming, of course. The Halkans have something you want, or, is it all some clever means to advance you to the Admiralty? Kirk. The Cabinet itself? Really? Well, you must know what you're doing. You always do. If I'm to be the woman of a Caesar, can't I know what you're up to? Let's drink a toast to Spock, The only man aboard with the decency to warn you, and he'll die for it. They'll never find another man like him. Are you going to act against the Halkans before the deadline? Just get him out of the way, he and his men. Shall I activate the Tantalus field? You'll at least want to monitor him, won't you? I hate this thing. Of course not. It made you captain. How many enemies have you simply wiped out of existence by the touch of a button? Fifty? A hundred? Now, I always thought that was funny, The great, powerful Captain Kirk who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist and a plundered laboratory. You don't rise to the command of a starship or even higher. That magnificent mind of his. But it can't protect him from this. I press it and he dies. Now? You really mean it. It doesn't matter. If Spock fails his order, he'll be killed anyway. You're not even afraid of Starfleet Command. Can your scheme bring you that much power so quickly? And what about me? How does Marlena fit in? Oiling my traps, darling. I'm afraid I'm a little out of practice. Maybe that's what happened to us? It's very hard for a working officer to shine as a woman every minute, and you demand perfection. I remember when you used to talk that way. Prove it. Ship's business? An important task on the crew deck? Well, I guess it's over. Commander Kenno will take me temporarily. He's made that quite clear. I'll call a yeoman to help me with my things. Are you feeling sorry for me? Do I see hesitation in your eyes about anything? I want one thing, Captain. Transfer me. On the Enterprise, I am humiliated! On another ship, I can hunt fresh game. I've got my rank, and. Don't I? I've been a captain's woman, and I like it. I'll be one again if I have to go through every officer in the fleet. It's been a long time since you've kissed me like that. You're a stranger. Mercy to the Halkans, mercy to Spock, to me. Am I your woman? Take me with you. But there are only three of you. Do you know what they'll do to me? What about me? Captain Kirk. Marlena Moreau. I was just assigned last week."

4997,TOS,episode 34,SPOCK,"The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry would be quite efficacious. Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this. Curious, even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature which maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six degrees. I find that most unusual, Captain. Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions. Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced. Captain. There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with remarkable agility, bearing one eight. A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say. Anything? Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite, hornblende, quartz. Fragile, good cleavage. An analysis should prove interesting. Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of power. If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may have to do with the vibrations I read earlier. If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean. Jim! Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my stomach. Other than that, I am quite well. I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving out of the way. I shall do so. One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require a highly sophisticated planetary defence system. Captain. Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that direction. Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable. I don't see how. You are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture. No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a commander could do. Self-recriminations Captain, our friend is back. Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient! Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice! Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir? Fascinating. A very high order of workmanship, very ancient, generating great power. No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is an access point. It would also seem to be a Obviously. Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all directions. Conventional in composition, and quite formidable. Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable. Yes. Spock. I am Spock. I fail to see what they find so amusing. Quite possible. It checks with my atmospheric analysis. Their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun. Apparently, our hypothesis is correct. There is no living being there. It is a machine, nothing more. Evidently not. This is no ordinary machine, Captain. It may well possess a rudimentary intelligence. That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free. Acknowledged. In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity. Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human cultures. I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this galaxy. Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them. Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy. What ever you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional reaction to it. I see no alternative. Well, I believe it's safe, safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions. I am concerned, Captain. This may not be an ideal society, but it is a viable one. If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive. Starfleet Command may think otherwise. Captain! Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared. Force field, Captain. Variation in impulses, Captain. I believe it is reading us. A strong jump on all wavelengths. Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement. The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieved true human stature. I submit there is no cause for worry. They've taken the first step. They've learned to kill. Readings are getting weaker, Captain. Wide variation in energy transmissions, as though Vaal were trying to draw on other sources. I would assume so. If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves. A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain. Obviously Vaal is trying to reinforce his energy field. No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead. That's not unusual, Doctor. Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on Gamma Trianguli Six. Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis. Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise. Not at all, Captain. I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain."

Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff. See the stuff on the end? It's like saplin, only it's a thousand times stronger. I filled him with enough masiform D to make the whole crew turn handsprings, and he's not responding. Got to get him back to the ship, Jim. If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an upset stomach. Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this. Well, there goes paradise. Incredible. I just ran a thorough check on the natives, and there's a complete lack of harmful bacteria in their systems, no decalcification, no degeneration of tissue, no arteriosclerosis. In simple terms, Jim, they're not growing old, and I can't begin to tell you how old they are, twenty years or twenty thousand years. What's going on, Jim? It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of a statement. There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment, the right to have conditions which permit growth. Jim, you're not just going to stand by and be blinded to what's going on here. These are humanoids, intelligent. They need to advance and grow. Don't you understand what my readings indicate? There's been no progress here in at least ten thousand years. This isn't life. It's stagnation. It might work for you, Mister Spock, but it doesn't work for me. Humanoids living so they can service a hunk of tin. From a machine? That I'd like to see. Second degree burns. Not serious, but I'll bet they smart. Jim Fine time to ring the dinner bell. I don't agree with you at all, Mister Spock. Jim, I want you to hear this. We put those people back on a normal course of social evolution. I see nothing wrong in that."

I don't think it's serious, but we're looking into it. I'm not sure, sir, but we've run measurements on the electromagnetic field of the planet, and they are a wee bit abnormal. That might have something to do with it. Well, sir, I didn't exactly say that. I hear it's nice down there. I could do with a nice walk in a garden with green leaves and grass. Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Scott, sir. Our antimatter pods are completely inert. I couldn't stop it, but I know why. Something from the surface. It's like a pail of water on a fire. A beam, maybe, or a transmission. And it's still on. I'm having it analysed, but it's like nothing I've seen before. And it's pinpointed in the area of that village we located down there. There's nothing you can do about it, sir. There doesn't seem to be any immediate danger. Scott here, sir. Aye, aye, sir. Transporter room, stand by to beam up landing party. Standing by, sir. Energise. We can't make transporter contact, sir. The entire system's inhibited. The way it is now, we couldn't beam up a fly. Captain's log, supplementary, Our investigation of Gamma Trianguli Six has suddenly turned into a nightmare. We're being watched and followed, Mister Spock has been injured, and now we find we are unable to return to the ship. I don't know, sir. I'll check it and get back with you. Scott out. Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Condition red. Condition red. Captain, something has grabbed us from the planet surface Like a giant tractor beam, and we can't break loose. Aye, sir. All we have is impulse power. They're all on, Captain. Kyle? Computer banks, Kyle. Feed in a rate, get me a figure. We might be able to pull out with warp drive, but without it We're like a fly on fly paper. Even worse We're starting to lose ground. Hurry up on that figure, Kyle. I've done that, Captain. They haven't been able to do a thing. It's no good, Captain. With maximum thrust against the pull We'll only be able to maintain full power for sixteen hours, then we burn up for sure. I'll do everything there is to do, sir. Scott out. Scott here. No change, Captain. The orbit is decaying along computed lines. No success with the warp drive. We're going down and we can't stop it. Sir, we're doing everything within engineering reason. Sir, I'm going to switch over everything but the life-support systems and boost the impulse power, but that's just about as dangerous. Scotty, sir. We have a reading on the power source Mister Spock requested. When we first monitored, it was generating alternating cycles totalling one hundred to the twentieth power Waltham units. No, sir. Power's dropping bit by bit. Nominal, but a definite drain. We're putting everything but the kitchen sink into impulse power, sir. It will take us another eight hours to complete the work. Aye, but if we don't break out, I'd rather we didn't have to wait too long for the end of it. Here, sir. Almost ready, sir. We need half an hour yet. I know that. As you said, that's cutting things fine. We're ready here, sir. All available power has been channelled into the impulse engines. We have twelve minutes before entering atmosphere. Full reverse, Mister Kyle, all engines. Captain, we're doing it. We're pulling away! Captain, we've pulled away a little. We gained maybe an hour, but we blew almost every system in the ship doing it. There's nothing left to try again. I guess you'll have to fire me, sir. Aye, but what Aye, sir, but they won't penetrate that force field. Scott here, sir. Mister Kyle, all phasers commence firing. Tractor beam gone. Potency returning to antimatter pods. I'll have all engineering sections working on the circuits immediately. Transporter'll be ready in an hour."
5011,TOS,episode 34,KIRK,"Start your readings. It is spectacular, isn't it? Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor readings. Starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted. We do what we're told. Are you sure about that? I know. Almost impossible. Just outside Moscow. All right. There's a village about seventeen kilometres away on bearing two three two. We'll head that way. What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this? Captain's log, stardate 3715.3. While making a routine exploration of the unexplored Gamma Trianguli Six, one of my men has been killed by a poisonous plant. As soon as we get out of the way, beam the body up. What is it? What's causing it? But you say there's nothing to worry about? Well, stay on top of it. We've got a job to down here. We might as well finish it. Yeah, it's nice. If we're a little more careful, we shouldn't run into any more trouble. We'll do the walking, Scotty. You get on the antimatter pod. If it gets worse, let me know, we'll beam up. Kirk out. Scotty will handle it. We've got a job to do. Turn up anything on your tricorder? That's strange. Mallory. We're heading for the village. Avoid contact with the humanoids. I want you and Marple to make a full reconnaissance. And be careful. There may be other dangers besides poisonous plants. Keep in constant communication. What is it? Mister Chekov, Yeoman Landon. I know you find each other fascinating, but we're not here to conduct a field experiment in human biology. Whatever it is, it moves like a cat. Neither do I. All hands. We've been watched, we'll probably be watched. We're moving out. Formation L. Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Mister Spock? Garden of Eden, with land mines. Kirk here. Why? We're heading there now, Scotty. You need any help? All right, Scotty. We'll try and find out what's going on down here. Kirk out. Some kind of generator? What's that? Peculiar stuff to find in paradise. Spock! Spock! Security alert. Is he alive? Kirk to Enterprise. We're beaming up. Notify transporter room. And make arrangements to pick up Mallory and Marple. They're scouting ahead of us. All hands. Energise. Scotty, energise. Scotty, what's the matter? Scotty, is the transporter malfunction tied in with trouble you're having with the antimatter pods? Spock. Are you all right? Just what do you think you were trying to do? Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself. I see. Well next time, just yell. I can step out of the way as quickly as the next man. Trying to get yourself killed. Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you? Never mind. But thanks. Kaplan, take the post. Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well. Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Come on! Phasers. A beautiful day, Mister Spock. Not a cloud in the sky. Just like paradise. Kirk here. Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Come in! Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Mallory! On the double. Mallory! Marple, stand back! Watch it! The rocks! Kaplan. Hendorff. I know Kaplan's family. Now Mallory. His father helped me get into the Academy. I could've prevented all of it. A walk in paradise, among the green grass and flowers. We should've beamed up at the first sign of trouble. I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider them overly hazardous. This isn't that important a mission, Spock. Not worth the lives of three of my men. I drop my guard for a minute because I like the smell of growing things, and now three men are dead. And the ship's in trouble. Marple, Chekov, at attention. Gentlemen, something or someone is behind that rock. I want it. Marple, cut around the rock to your right. Make a loud noise. Be careful. Spock, you and Chekov create a diversion and make it loud. I won't hurt you. Do you understand? I won't hurt you. Well, I won't strike you again. You've been following us, watching us. Why? Who is Vaal? Do you have a name? They're not going to hurt you. I promise you. Akuta, Akuta, we come in peace. We would like to speak to this Vaal. Antennae? You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby? Kirk here. Scotty, are the warp drives still out? Put it on maximum. Full emergency circuits. Status, are you still holding? Maintain full reverse thrust against the pull. Put a team on that warp drive. Get it working. Scotty, you're my Chief Engineer. You know everything about that ship there is to know. More than the men who designed it. If you can't get those warp engines working You're fired. Tell me about Vaal. Take me to him. I wish to speak to him. I'll take my chances. But this is not the centre, Mister Spock. A force field? You all right? Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal? Well, we can't get to it. We can't talk to it unless it wants to talk to us. When does he get hungry? Where are the others? The children. Little ones like yourselves. They grow. Well, thank you. It does something for you. Nothing makes sense down here. Kirk to Enterprise. Status report, Scotty. I'm sick of hearing that word can't. Get that ship out of there. Then use your imagination. Tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines. Discard the warp drive nacelles if you have to, and crack out of there with the main section, but get that ship out of there! Do it. Kirk out. Report. I see. Opinion. Add to that a simple diet, a perfectly controlled temperature, no natural enemies, apparently no vices, no replacements needed. Maybe it is paradise after all. Mister Spock. Well, the field's down, people are going in. Let's see what kind of luck we have. That's not the way. But it needs to eat. Frequently. So it can't have any great power reserves. What happens if Vaal weakens around feeding time? Spock, check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab. Get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship. Have them measure it hour by hour. Mess call. Gentlemen, I think this philosophical argument can wait until our ship's out of danger. Kirk here. Did it maintain, Scotty? Good. Keep monitoring. How are you coming along with the circuit switchover? That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty. Kirk out. Yeoman, you're wasting energy. Sit down, and have something to eat. That hasn't happened yet. I wonder what would happen? Yeoman, speculate. What would happen if someone on this planet died? Accidents happen. They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock? Mister Spock? You're the science officer. Why don't you explain it to the young lady. Bones was right. These people aren't living, they're existing. They don't create, they don't produce, they don't even think. They exist to service a machine. These are people, not robots. They should have the opportunity of choice. We owe it to them to interfere. I'll take my chances. Why don't you have a look around? Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott? How's it going, Scotty? You realise that within forty five minutes, the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere? Yes, I Kirk out. What is it? Vaal, we are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or your people. Let's get out of here! Bones! Marple! Put them in the hut. Find out where the women are. Put them in there, too. All right, Scotty, put her in full reverse. Get her out of there. Scotty, what happened? You're fired. Four hundred people They'll die because I couldn't see a warning sign. I had to follow orders, always orders. Bones, that's it. Stay with Chekov. Keep those people from feeding Vaal. Don't let them feed Vaal. Keep them in the hut. Mister Spock. Scotty, do you still have phaser power? Lock all banks on the co-ordinates of the energy field located down here. KIRK; On my command, commence firing on those co-ordinates. If my guess is correct, they won't have to. Stand by. Tapping its energy cells. Good. The ship's pulling away must have weakened it considerable. It has to be fed, but its reserve capacity could hold out for days. My plan exactly. Scotty. Scotty, commence firing and maintain. Good. Let's see how long he can do it. Scotty, cease fire. Mister Scott, status report. Scotty, you're re-hired. As soon as the transporter's fixed, form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down. Kirk out. Chekov, Bones. Let those people go. You'll learn to care for yourselves, with our help. And there's no trick to putting fruit on trees. You might enjoy it. You'll learn to build for yourselves, think for yourselves, work for yourselves, and what you create is yours. That's what we call freedom. You'll like it, a lot. And you'll learn something about men and women, the way they're supposed to be. Caring for each other, being happy with each other, being good to each other. That's what we call love. You'll like that, too, a lot. You and your children. The little ones? Look like you? Just go on the way you're going. You'll find out. Well, that's a good object lesson, Mister Spock. It's an example of what can happen when a machine becomes too efficient, does too much work for you. Yes, of course I'm aware of it. Adam and Eve tasted the apple and as a result were driven out of paradise. Doctor, do I understand him correctly? Are you casting me in the role of Satan? Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan? No, Mister Spock. I didn't think you would be. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Akuta alone speaks to Vaal. I am the eyes and the voice of Vaal. It is Vaal's wish. They are my ears for Vaal. They were given to me in the dim time so the people could understand his commands and obey. We are close to Vaal so we may serve him. I shall take you there. All the world knows about Vaal. He causes the rains to fall and the sun to shine. All good comes from Vaal. I shall take you to him, but he will not speak to you. He speaks only to me. Vaal. Captain's log, stardate 3715.6. We have been introduced to Vaal. Evidently the source of the planet's power emanations and possibly the force that threatens both us and our ship. Vaal calls me. Only then. Vaal sleeps now. When he is hungry, you may be able to speak with him, if he desires it. Soon. Come. We will give you food and drink. If you are tired, you may rest. These are the people of Vaal. There are no others. Children? You use unknown words to me. Replacements. None are necessary. They are forbidden by Vaal. Love. Strange words. Children. Love. What is love? Ah, yes. The holding, the touching. Vaal has forbidden this. These people, are from another place. They have come among us. Welcome them! Come! This house is your house. I will send you more food and drink. You are welcome in the place of Vaal. I understand, Vaal. It shall be done. The law is plain. I have given you the words of Vaal. Do you beg the lightning to strike? You copied them? Vaal speaks truly to me. The newcomers are a danger. Tell the men of Vaal to meet me in the clear place when the strangers are asleep. It is Vaal's own words. is the head of one of the strangers. Find a heavy stick. Come up from behind the stranger and do this. It is a simple thing. It is the word of Vaal. It will be done to all of them when the sun returns in the morning. Vaal calls to us.

5248,TOS,episode 35,SPOCK,"Captain, sensors show this entire solar system has been destroyed. Nothing left but rubble and asteroids. Nonetheless, Captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year. Captain, the two inner most planets of this system appear to be intact. I have it on the sensors, Captain. By configuration, a starship stopped in space. She appears to be drifting. Sensors not recording normal energy output. She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems. All power plants dead, reserve energy banks operative at a very low power level. Also operative at a low power level. The entire Bridge is damaged and uninhabitable. The rest of the ship seems able to sustain life. Normal, but subspace interference makes readings difficult. Acknowledged. Enterprise, Spock here. Improbable, Captain. The surface temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead. The other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life. Spock here, Captain. Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference. Attempting to remedy. She was attacked by what appears to be essentially a robot, an automated weapon of immense size and power. Its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel. It is, therefore, self-sustaining as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on. Unknown, Captain. However, Mister Sulu has computed the path of the machine, using the destroyed solar systems as a base course. Projecting back on our star charts, we find that it came from outside, from another galaxy. If it follows its present path, it will go through the most densely populated section of our galaxy. Red alert! Red alert! It came up on us fast, Captain, but we seem able to maintain our distance. It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer. And it is pursuing us. We are more manoeuvrable, but it is gaining on us. Sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive. No evidence of life, subspace interference level incredibly high. I would say none, Captain. The energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attracts it. I doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves. I also believe the nature of this machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms. Closing, Captain. Acknowledged. Transporter Room, stand by to beam landing party aboard. Evasive action, Mister Sulu. Damage report, all stations. Affect repairs. Captain Kirk, come in please. Captain, we've been attacked. The transporter is damaged. We're taking evasive action. Damage in communications, Captain. Interference will We have outrun it, Doctor. Impulse and warp engines operative, transporter and communications under repair. Random chance seems to have operated in our favour. I believe I said that, Doctor. Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship beyond a certain radius. We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle back to pick up the Captain. I am aware of the Rigel system's population, Commodore, but we are only one ship. Our deflector shields are strained, our subspace transmitter is useless. Logically, our primary duty is to survive in order to warn Starfleet Command. Mister Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the Constellation. You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu. You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it. You tried to destroy it once before, Commodore. The result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew. Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium. A single ship cannot combat it. Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no alternative. Paragraph 1A clearly states If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C. You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it. Then your statement would not be considered valid. Deflector shields at full power. They can't take much more of this. Deflectors holding, but weakening. We must retreat, Commodore. The energy drain Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal. It has ceased fire. We're being held in a tractor beam. We're being pulled inside, Commodore. You must veer off. We have lost warp power. If we don't break the tractor beam within sixty seconds, we never will. That, sir, is illogical. It is suicide. Attempted suicide would be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command. If you don't veer off, I shall relieve you on that basis. Emergency impulse power. It's closing fast on the Constellation. Commodore, I suggest This machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere. Any energy source entering that field is subject to attack. Warp drive and deflectors will be out for a solar day. Repairs proceeding on transporter and communications. We can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we exhaust our fuel, but it can refuel itself indefinitely. Illogical. We cannot destroy it. Therefore, we cannot save Rigel. We must transport the Captain and the others from the Constellation and escape this thing's subspace interference in order to warn Starfleet Command. Can you raise Starfleet? On audio, Lieutenant. Commodore. Warp drive out. Deflector shields down. Transporter under repair. We are on emergency impulse power. At least one solar day. At our present rate of consumption, we'll exhaust our impulse power long before then. Commodore Decker, you are relieved of command. You may file a formal protest with Starfleet Command, assuming we survive to reach a Starbase. But you are relieved. Commodore. I do not wish to place you under arrest. Vulcans never bluff. Captain, I have assumed command. One moment, sir. Commodore. I believe you are scheduled for medical examination. Mister Montgomery. You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay. Mister Sulu, change course. Seven zero mark two one. Captain, we are taking an evasive course back to you. We will try to stay ahead of the object until we can transport you aboard. Yes, sir. Shut them, Mister Sulu. Whoever it is, Captain, has no authorisation. Lieutenant, raise the shuttlecraft. Commodore, I must insist that you return to the ship. You cannot succeed, Commodore. Your only logical alternative is to return to the ship. He's gone. Constellation, come in, please. Captain Kirk, come in please. Sir, may I offer my condolences on the death of your friend. It is most regrettable. The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible. The object is still pursing us, thereby causing us to drain our power reserve at a much greater rate. Transporter operational, Captain. Shall we beam you aboard? There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation. Acknowledged. Transporter Room. Beam damage control party aboard. No, sir. Ninety seven point eight three five megatons. Negative, Captain. Its hull is pure neutronium. There is no known way of blasting through it. Insufficient data. I shall try to take further sensor readings. Captain? The object's neutronium hull makes sensor readings of the inner mechanism impossible. Correct. Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer. Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker. Your chances of survival are not promising. We don't even know if the explosion will be powerful enough. There's another factor, Captain. The transporter is not working at one hundred percent efficiency. Thirty seconds is very slim timing. Transporter, stand by. Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to stand by. Acknowledged. Mister Scott, speed is of the essence. Captain, transporter operational, but just barely. Transporter, stand by. Energise. We can't, Captain. Transporter is out again. Mister Scott, twenty seconds to detonation. Mister Scott? Mister Scott Try inverse phasing. Mister Scott? Energy output zero. Radiation level normal. Welcome aboard, Captain. Sensors show all energy sources deactivated. It's quite dead. Indeed, Captain. I presume your log will show that Commodore Decker died in the line of duty. Appropriate, Captain. However, I can't help wondering if there are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe."

We can't break loose! SPOCK; We need more power. We haven't got it. We're being pulled inside. Aye, sir. We still can't move. We're loose, Commodore. Standing by, sir. We're moving away, Commodore. It's closing with us again, sir. It's sucking in space rubble from those destroyed planets. Refueling itself. It's gaining on us, sir. Mark twenty one, sir. Mister Spock, someone's opening the shuttlecraft bay doors. It's too late, sir. Mister Spock, sensors indicate a minute drop in the machine's power emanations. Do you think the shuttlecraft explosion might have done some damage? He's two thousand miles from the planet killer and closing fast. Fifteen hundred miles and closing. One thousand miles and closing. Five hundred miles and closing. Sixty, fifty, forty Thirty. Ten Nine, eight Seven. Six. Five, four"
5261,TOS,episode 35,SCOTT,"The whole communication system looks to be shorted out, too, sir. Come along, lads. I don't know, lad. But I want a full structural and control damage check, and I'm going to have a look at those engines. Captain, I've checked the engines. The warp drive is a hopeless pile of junk. The impulse engines are not too badly off. We ought to be able to do something with them. Exhausted. They didn't give up without a battle. Computer system is still intact. We can playback the duplicate Captain's Log from the auxiliary control room. Ready with the duplicate log, sir. Captain, Washburn has our report. Aye, that all adds up. But what sort of a thing could do all that? And paralysed. No power. I can't repair warp drive without a spacedock. Aye, the impulse engines are still in fair shape. I might coax them. Come on, lad. Captain, the impulse engines' control circuits are fused solid. Aye, we can cross-connect the controls, but it'll make the ship almost impossible for one man to handle. Aye, sir. Controls are all hooked up, sir. We should have some power for you soon. Coming, sir. If I push these impulse engines too hard in the condition they're in, they'll blow apart. Aye, sir. SPOCK; Sir, deflector shields are gone. You've got it, Captain. Just enough to move us. I can't do better. Captain, I still don't know what we're doing. Phasers? You've got 'em. I have one bank recharged. Captain Kirk. I've hooked in ship's communication. The best I can give you on impulse is one third power. The shields are up but they won't last long. Here, sir. The damage control party just beamed back to the Enterprise. Aye. The shape the thing's in, it's hard to keep her from blowing. I want you to rig a thirty second delay detonation device, and rig it so that it can be blown from up here. Aye, sir. Right away. A cranky transporter's a mighty finicky piece of machinery to be gambling your life on, sir. I've linked it in with the impulse control system. It's armed now. Press this one. Thirty seconds later, poof! Once it's activated, there's no way to stop it. Good luck, Captain. What's the matter with that thing? It'll never work like this. It's the main junction circuitry. I'll get it. Bridge, transporter operational, but this jury-rigging won't last for long. He's got to come off now. I'll stand by here. Och, what's wrong with it? Try her now, Mister Kyle."
5262,TOS,episode 35,KIRK,"Can you pinpoint it any closer, Lieutenant? But that's incredible. The star in this system is still intact. Only a nova could destroy like that. Continue a search pattern. Every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble and still no sign of the Constellation. Matt Decker's in command. What could have happened to him? Try to raise it, Lieutenant. Approach course, Mister Sulu. It's the Constellation. Look at that. She was attacked. Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations! Mister Sulu? Very good. Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for any other vessel. Lieutenant Palmer. Keep trying. Mister Spock, full evaluation of the damage to the Constellation. Life support systems? Radiation levels? All hands, go to Yellow Alert. Stand by battle stations. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, and a damage control party report to me in the transporter room. We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command. Scotty, check the phaser banks. See if they've been fired. Bones, you come with me. No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee. Whatever happened didn't happen without a warning. The crew wasn't abducted, they just left. Kirk to Enterprise. No survivors, no bodies either. Is it possible they could have beamed down to one of the two planets? We'll continue our search. Kirk out. Phaser banks? But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative. Matt. Matt, it's Jim Kirk. Matt? Matt. What happened to your ship, Matt? What thing? What was it? Answer me! What was it? What happened, Matt? Go. The fourth planet. Only two left now. Scotty, pull the microtapes from the sensor memory banks and beam them aboard to Spock. I want a full analysis, a complete report of what happened when they went in on that planet. What happened to your crew? What hit? What attacked you? Matt, where's your crew? There is no third planet. Go. Deactivated? Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening field do that, and would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference? What does it look like? What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive, or is it Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up. You went in to investigate. Did you run a scanner check on it? What kind of a beam? Kirk here. What about the Constellation's tapes? A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. Why? What is the projected course of this thing? Thank you. Stand by, Mister Spock. Kirk out. We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy. Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine? It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff. It's never meant to be used. So strong, it could destroy both sides in a war. Something like the old H-Bomb was supposed to be. That's what I think this is. A doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago. They don't exist anymore, but the machine is still destroying. Take it easy. There's no ship to leave. It's a dead hulk! We'll take her in tow. I'll stay onboard and get her ready. You go back to the Enterprise with the doctor and let him help you. Kirk to Enterprise. Have the transporter room beam Doctor McCoy and Commodore Decker on board immediately. We're blind here. What's it look like? Whatever it is, we can't let it go beyond us to the next solar system. We have to stop it. If it's a robot, what are the chances of deactivating it? All right. Lower your deflector screens Long enough to beam us aboard. Kirk here. Spock? Spock? Come in, Spock. Spock? We're stuck, blind, and deaf. Well, we just can't stand around while our ship is being attacked. Scotty, you've got to get me some manoeuvering power. Then get me impulse power. Half-speed, quarter-speed, anything. If we get this hulk moving, maybe we can do something. Then get moving. Washburn, you get in there. Let's see what we can do about this viewing screen. I've got to find out what's happening out there. Kirk here. What about the warp drive control circuits? You worry about your miracles, Scotty, I'll worry about mine. Get to work. Washburn, try the 2G6 circuit. Ready to give it a try? Scotty, how you doing? Yes, I think What the devil's going on? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, come in. Mister Spock, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, where's that power? Washburn, get down to Engineering. Assist Mister Scott. Scotty, push it right to the edge. This ship has got to manoeuver. Scotty, give me that power. That'll do. Full ahead, Mister Scott. That's it, Mister Scott. Keep that power coming. Keep pouring it on, Scotty. We're moving, the Enterprise isn't. Maybe that thing will see us and let the Enterprise go. If I only had some phasers. Scotty, you've just earned your pay for the week. Stand by. Fire phasers. Mister Scott, it worked. Great. I think it's great. Scotty, get us out of here. Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Matt. What's going on? Give me Mister Spock. What happened to Spock? You are speaking to a senior officer, Kirk. Give me Spock. There's only one thing I want to say to you, Commodore. Get my ship out of there. Mister Spock, ship status. How long to repair warp drive? Take evasive action, Mister Sulu. Not with my ship, you don't. Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately. That's a direct order. Blast regulations! Mister Spock, I order you to assume command on my personal authority as Captain of the Enterprise. Good. Now, Mister Spock Fine. Just make sure you stay ahead of it. Yes, Scotty. Keep it going, Scotty, keep it going. Mister Spock. I'm plotting an intercept course. Will rendezvous with you at fourteen thirteen point seven hours. Kirk to Enterprise. Why are you launching a shuttlecraft? This is Kirk. Matt, you'll be killed. No one expects you to die for an error in judgment. Matt. Matt, listen to me. You can't throw your life away like this. Matt, you're a starship commander. That makes you a valuable commodity. We need you, your experience, your judgment. Matt! We're stronger with you than without you! Kirk here. It's regrettable that he died for nothing. What about that, Spock? Is it possible? Negative. Mister Scott and I will stay here, but beam the damage control party aboard. Except possibly the destruction of that thing out there. Carry out your orders, Mister Spock. Spock, listen. Maybe Matt Decker didn't die for nothing. He had the right idea but not enough power to do it. Am I correct in assuming that a fusion explosion of ninety seven megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded? Ninety seven point eight three five. Will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there? Not through it, Spock, from inside it. Will it be enough? Do the best you can and make it fast. Kirk to Scott. Good. Scotty, can you set the ship's impulse engines to overload? Aye, sir. Set it and get up here as fast as you can. Spock, you don't know? I intend to get a lot closer. I'm going to ram her right down that thing's throat. No. No, I don't intend to die, Mister Spock. We've rigged a delay detonation device. You'll have thirty seconds to beam me aboard the Enterprise before the Constellation's impulse engines blow. A calculated risk, Mister Spock. A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out. What about the detonator? Understood. Mister Spock. Prepare to beam Scotty on board. Thank you. I can't. Power level's dropping too fast. You'd better hurry. Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal. Beam me aboard. Gentlemen, beam me aboard. Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard. Mister Sulu, ease us back to minimum headway. Conserve power as much as possible. Lieutenant Palmer, tell Mister Scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive. Poor Matt. He gave his life in an attempt to save others. Not the worst way to go. Indeed it shall, Mister Spock. Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the 20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine. Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes. Well, I certainly hope not. I found one quite sufficient. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster beacon. No answer, Captain. All I get is the automatic beacon. Red alert. Red alert. Man your battle stations. I can't raise the Constellation, sir. I'm still getting the distress beacon, but there's heavy subspace interference. It's almost blocking the signal. Aye, aye, sir. Mister Spock, communication's damaged. We're unable to override interference. Sir, Deck seven reports power failure in main energisers. Implementing emergency procedures. Severe casualties reported on decks three and four. Damage control party sealing off inner hull rupture. Mister Spock, we've pierced the interference locally. No, sir, but I've got ship-to-ship communications back. Picking up Captain Kirk. Enterprise to shuttlecraft. Come in, shuttlecraft. Enterprise to shuttlecraft. Come in, shuttlecraft. Come in, shuttlecraft. Mister Spock, the transporter is now operational."
5486,TOS,episode 35,WASHBURN,"Radiation level normal. Atmospheric pressure eleven pounds per square inch. What a mess. What do you think did it, sir? We made a complete check on structural and control damage, sir. As far as we can tell, something crashed through the deflectors and knocked out the generators. Somehow the antimatter in the warp drive pods has been deactivated. Just one minute, sir. Try it now, Captain. Aye, sir."
5487,TOS,episode 35,DECKER,"Kirk. It's Jim Kirk. A ship. Attacked. That, that thing. That Captain's log, stardate 4202.1. Exceptionally heavy subspace interference still prevents our contacting Starfleet to inform them of the destroyed solar systems we have encountered. We are now entering system L-374. Science Officer Masada reports the fourth planet seems to be breaking up. We are going to investigate. We tried to contact Starfleet. No one heard. No one! We couldn't run. Oh, I had to beam them down. We were dead. No power, our phasers useless. I stayed behind, the last man. The Captain, the last man aboard the ship. That's what you're supposed to do, isn't it? And then it hit again and the transporter went out. They were down there, and I'm up here. They say there's no devil, Jim, but there is. Right out of hell, I saw it. On the third planet. Don't you think I know that? There was, but not anymore. They called me. They begged me for help, four hundred of them. I couldn't. I couldn't. If you'd seen it, you'd know. The whole thing's a weapon. It must be. Well, it's miles long, with a maw that could swallow a dozen starships. It destroys planets, chops them into rubble. Both or neither. I don't know. We saw this thing hovering over the planet, slicing out chunks of it with a force beam. Pure antiproton. Absolutely pure. Oh, forget about your theories! That thing is on the way to the heart of our galaxy. What are you going to do about it? Oh, no, I stay here. I'm not leaving my ship! It's just that I, I, I never lost a command before. Status report. You can't let that reach Rigel. Why, millions of innocent people would die. Our primary duty is to maintain life and safety of Federation planets. Do you deny that? Belay that last order, helmsman. One hundred and eighty degree turn, hard about. We're going to attack. Mister Spock, I'm officially notifying you that I'm exercising my option under regulations as a Starfleet Commodore, and that I am assuming command of the Enterprise. That thing must be destroyed. I made a mistake then. We were too far away. This time I'm going to hit it with full phasers at point-blank range. Mister Spock, that will be all. You have been relieved of command. Don't force me to relieve you of duty as well. Doctor, you are out of line. You may leave the Bridge, Doctor. Doctor, you may leave the Bridge. Mister Spock knows his duty under regulations, Doctor. Do you? Hard about, helmsman. Course thirty two degrees, mark ten. Deflectors at full power. Ready on main phaser banks. Helmsman, hold your course. Stand by all phaser banks. I'm in command here, Mister Spock. Maintain your course, helmsman. Get us in closer. Fire! Recommendation noted. Maintain course. Fire! Maintain phaser fire, helmsman. But don't you understand? We've got to destroy it! Veer off. Full power astern. Good boy, Jim. Between the two of us, we'll kill that thing. Kirk pulled us out of there by distracting it. Now it's our turn. Fire phasers. We did it! Hard about. Give me some distance. Mister Spock, status report. Maintain speed and distance. Then we'll have to fight it now before it gets any stronger. Mister Spock, I am still in command. I will speak for this ship. Enterprise to Kirk. Commodore Decker speaking. I'm in command here, Jim. Nothing. I assumed command according to regulations Since your first officer was reluctant to take aggressive action against the You mean you're the lunatic who's responsible for almost destroying my ship? You are speaking to a senior officer, Kirk. I told you, I am in command here, according to every rule in the book, Captain. Anything you have to say at all, you will say to me. Down here. I told you, I am in command here and I will give the orders, Captain. We're going to turn and attack. You can't relieve me and you know it. According to regulations I don't recognise your authority to relieve me. You wouldn't dare. You're bluffing. No. No, I don't suppose that they do. Very well, Mister Spock. The Bridge is yours. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Decker here. You said it yourself, Spock. There is no way to blast through the hull of that machine, so I'm going to take this thing right down its throat. I've been prepared for death ever since I, ever since I killed my crew. The commander is responsible for the lives of his crew, and for their deaths. Well, I should have died with mine."

Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain. According to our transporter co-ordinates this is the exact location from which Jackson was beamed up to the ship. No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form readings. Twenty four degrees mark seven. Range one thirty seven point one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain. No change, Captain. Very bad poetry, Captain. What we've just seen is not real. However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred metres, there are definitely life forms. Erratic, confused, but definitely registering. This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're inside, somewhere. I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference. Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside. Trick or treat, Captain? That would seem to be in order. The readings would so indicate. Yes. I am undamaged, Captain. I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are real. As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an instinctive level. Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed. Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before. There never have been any life forms on Pyris Seven. There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their familiars. Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard. I do not create the legend, Captain. I merely report it. Ingenious. Mind probing? Hypnosis? Telepathy? Not entirely, no. Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure you that I have full control over your friends. Twenty two minutes, seventeen seconds. I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite familiar. Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious. The universal myths, symbols. And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness. And they missed. They reached basically only the subconscious. Korob seemed puzzled by your reaction to the environment he'd provided. And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy. Evidently something totally alien in all respects. I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action. You came in a ship? Fascinating. Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger. Ready when you are, Captain. Quickly, Captain. Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please. Captain. Jim! Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together? A most unpleasant situation, Captain. If only your phaser had some power. Don't let her touch the wand, Captain. Jim! Fascinating. A life form totally alien to our galaxy. If we could preserve and study this"

KIRK; Would it? I wonder. Three witches, what appears to be a castle and a black cat. Dust, cobwebs. Halloween is right. You were saying something about trick or treat. Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort? They appear to be drugged, Jim. Look at their eyes. Hardly blink at all. They're going to release us. That cat. Familiars? He doesn't know about trick or treat. We're not hungry. These look real. Tests? You kept Scott and Sulu as catspaws to lure us down here. How'd you know we'd come? What happened, Jim? Too late.

Both those men are well aware of landing party procedure. They should've checked in with us by now. Enterprise. Kirk here. One? Jackson, where are Scott and Sulu? Jackson! Notify Transporter room to prepare to beam up one member of the landing party. Then have Doctor McCoy report to me in the Transporter room on the double. Energise. Trouble. Jackson, where are the others? Odd. Our probe data didn't indicate fog. Readings, Mister Spock. Kirk to Enterprise. What are the ship's sensors reading now, Lieutenant? Lieutenant, can you hear me? I don't know. There has to be some explanation for the fact that the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking up readings of multiple life forms. Are they still there, Spock? Stand-by alert. Quiet. 1 Who are you? 1 Spock. Comment? A more useful comment, Mister Spock. That's useful. That's where we're going. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference? And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors. Could it be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan. If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead I'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us. Yes, Mister Spock. You'd be a natural. I'll explain it to you one day. Shall we have a look around? Bones. Spock. Straight ahead, Mister Spock? Spock. Are you all right? Bones? Doc? Dungeons, curses, skeletons and iron maidens. They're all Earth manifestations. Why? None of this parallels any human development. It's more like a human nightmare. Ghost stories, ogres, demons. The whole Scotty, Sulu. Scotty. Put down the phaser. Scotty! These two are alive. Scotty, do you hear me? Sulu, do you know who I am? What's happened to you? Whoever you are, you've proven your skill at creating illusion. Now I want to know why and what you've done to my men. Not when one of my men is dead because of it and two others turned into mindless Who are you? Why did you bring us here? Why? For what reason? Why all the mumbo-jumbo? That cat. Superstition. All right, Korob. What do you want from us? You'll find us most unco-operative unless you start explaining yourself. We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship. They mean nothing to us. Whatever it is you read, you read it wrong. As for leaving, we'll leave when we're ready. Don't move! Cover them. Now, I want the rest of our weapons and our equipment. I want some answers. You can't think a man to death. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Come in. Enterprise. From Captain Kirk. Come in. Never mind about us. What's happening up there? DeSalle, channel bypass power into your heat dissipation units. All right. I'll handle it down here. Kirk out. You've won. You seem to be singing a different tune. I'd rather know more about yours. You call it magic, you call it science. It seems unrelated to both of them. I wouldn't attempt to name it, but you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools. You alter matter, move it about by telekinesis. It's too late for threats. You let me contact the ship. How long do you think it will it be before a search party arrives? We have nothing to discuss. How long has it been? Thanks. I wonder what they're doing to Doc. Familiar. Startling. Not rational. Ghosts, witches. They tried to tap our conscious mind. He expected me to react as though it were all normal. Well, he admitted that they weren't native to this planet. They refer to us as creatures, as though we were some species that they were unfamiliar with. If we're creatures, I wonder what they're really like. Agreed. Totally alien. And I don't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock. Not at all like friendly visitors. We're going to have to stop them, cold. But at the moment Oh, Bones. Doc. What now? You wave your magic wand and destroy my mind, too? You don't call that damage? You'd know if you had compassion. A woman should have compassion, but I forget you're not a woman. You seem to need us. Why? What about Korob? Why don't you simply probe my mind and get what you want? You're very persuasive. What happens if I go along? For the same reasons you excite me. You're a very beautiful woman. You have a knack for giving me difficult choices. You have nothing like that where you come from? Your people, when they come here Transmuter? Then it's a device. You do use tools. You haven't changed your mind? You won't return home? And why not? You've been using me and my crew. I'm not leaving without my men. Transmuter. Yes, she mentioned that. Why a cat? You'd better let us. It's out of energy. She must have drained it. We could have jumped Scott and Sulu at any time. We didn't know. No way out. Do you think you can make it? Get ready. Korob, that door won't last. Korob seemed to think this was important. Said something about a transmuter. Doc. Well, at least we found them. Maybe we do. Sylvia, I have the transmuter. It's mine now. Don't you get tired of these games? I wasn't sure before, but I am now. This is the source of your power, isn't it. The transmuter. I catch on quickly. Why? Because your people have nothing of your own? Is that why you need us? No. I don't know what you are but you're not a woman. You've tortured my men and taken their minds from them. You ask for love and return pain instead. That'll take some explaining, Bones. Not everything. Korob and Sylvia as they really are. Their forms were an illusion, just like the castle and everything else. Only the power pack gave them reality. No illusion. Jackson is dead. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Five to beam up. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

5744,TOS,episode 36,SYLVIA,"Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Captain Kirk. You wanted to know what we did to your men. Actually it's a simple matter for us to probe the minds of creatures like yourself. You like to think of yourselves as complex creatures, but you're flawed. One gains admittance to your minds through many levels. You have too many to keep track of yourselves. There are unguarded entrances to any human mind. Put that weapon down! Captain, it seems so foolish of you to insist on demonstrations. In the mythology of your race this is called sympathetic magic. Jackson, the crew member who returned to the ship. You wondered what killed him. I made an image of him. In the essence of my thoughts the image was Jackson. And when I killed the image and knew that it was dead, he died. Your communicator. Now, signal your ship. You can relax now, Captain. Your ship is safe. Korob, you talk too much. Enough of this! You will tell us what we want to know. I would advise you to co-operate, Captain. Forcible extraction of the information we wish from you is not complicated, but it is extremely painful and it has a certain draining effect. Wait. The doctor will stay. Your turn will be next, Captain. It makes little difference. Take them out of here. I forget nothing. I'm not a puppet, Korob, like you. You are a fool. We have nothing like this and I like it. To touch, to feel to understand the idea of luxury I like it. And I don't intend to leave it. What do they know of sensations? This is a new world. And that, too, is a new sensation. I find it stimulating. I live by my own decisions. You're a weak fool, Korob. But you're afraid to use it. Don't threaten me. I can squash you and that would be an interesting sensation, yes. I find I like these new sensations. Don't try to push me. Captain. It's time for our talk. Korob, leave us alone and take these men with you. But it may end soon, old man. There's no real damage to the mind, Captain, simply a drain of knowledge and will. Why should I? But you're mistaken, Captain. I am a woman now. I come from a world without sensation as you and I now know it. It excites me. I want more. Because you have knowledge which I lack. but were our abilities put together. Tell me about power, Captain. How does it feel? He is a fool. I'll do without him. But you? Why do I find you different? Why would it be so difficult to dispose of you? No, not that, not for you. What I want is a joining. My mind to yours willingly. Think of the secrets you could learn. Think of the power that would be yours. Anything you can imagine, I can give you. Then everything would be ours together. I've never conceived of the idea of togetherness before. It excites me. You excite me. Why? You find me beautiful? But I can be many women. You like what you see. or do you prefer me as I was? Nothing. They're like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter. The source. You will learn. I will teach you later. Later. It gives only form. You're teaching me substance. My home is here with you. A billion worlds of sensation to pick and choose. You are using me. You hold me in your arms and there is no fire in your mind. You're trying to deceive me! It's here, like words on a page. You are using me. You will be swept away. You, your men, your ship, your worlds! You're very clever, Captain. More so than I'd imagined. Clever, resourceful and handsome. I've never played games. Give it to me. No, not the source. It's merely an amplifier. The mind is the source. Mine is simple, but yours has the key but you don't know how to use it. It is not too late, Captain James Kirk. Come with me. I'll teach you. You'll teach me. We need your dreams, your ambition. With them, I can build. Give me the transmuter. You fool. Don't you know what you're giving up? Everything that your species finds desirable. Look at me. I am a woman. I am all women. Korob was wrong. I didn't destroy all your weapons. Give me the transmuter. Give it to me!"

5746,TOS,episode 36,WITCH,"Captain Kirk! 2 Captain Kirk! 3 Captain Kirk! Go back! 2 Go back! 3 Go back! Remember the curse! 1 Wind shall rise. 2 And fog descend. 3 So leave here, all, or meet your end."
5747,TOS,episode 36,KOROB,"Captain Kirk, can you hear me? There is a curse on your ship. Leave this place or you will all die. Captain's Log, stardate 3018.2. Crewman Jackson is dead and there are no apparent physical causes. Mister Scott and Mister Sulu are still out of touch on the planet below. Leaving Assistant Chief Engineer DeSalle in command of the Enterprise, I'm beaming down to the planet's surface to find my two missing crewmen and discover what killed Jackson. Stop! Where did your race get this ridiculous predilection for resistance? You examine any object, you question everything. Is it not enough to accept what is? NO, not mindless. These two are merely controlled, Captain Kirk. Oh, yes, we know who you are. All of you. Don't we, my precious? My name is Korob. And as for bringing you here, it was you who quite contrarily insisted upon coming. You were warned to stay away. Mumbo-jumbo? Oh! Oh, no, I assure you it was not that, Captain. It is of no importance that we are not native to this planet. Oh! I'm told that I've been an inattentive host, gentlemen. You will join me for something to refresh yourselves. You are the different one, Mister Spock. You do not think like the others. There are no colours to your patterns of logic. There's only black and white. You see all this around you, yet you do not believe. I do not understand that reference, therefore it also is of no importance. Gentlemen, I can be most hospitable. Do be seated. But I insist. For the moment, merely that you eat and enjoy. Oh, Doctor, do try the wine. You'll find it excellent. Hopefully I can change that attitude. They are, I assure you. Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires. All the crystalline forms that you cherish above all things. A fortune of them for each of you if you leave here without further inquiry. Valueless? I don't understand. I read You are most unpredictable. Perhaps I have made a small mistake. Nevertheless, you have passed the tests. Yes. Our analysis of you may have been in some small way in error, but you were warned to stay away and yet you came to save your comrades. That proves loyalty. Your bravery was tested and you did not frighten. And despite my failure with these bright baubles, I perceive that you cannot be bribed. In many ways you are quite admirable. Quite right. Go at once, yes. Gentlemen, my colleague. Sylvia. Don't. Sylvia, don't. Captain, you've seen something of our science. Now tell us about yours. What would you name it, Captain? Yes, we can change the molecular structure Oh, we didn't have to know. They knew. Some time, Captain. Quite some time. There will be no search party, Captain Kirk. An impenetrable force field around your ship, Captain. It will not hinder orbit, but your people are prisoners within it. Take them to their cell. You forget what we were sent here for. You're a traitor. We have a duty to the old ones. You're cruel. You torture our specimens. You're wrong! You're discarding everything we live by. I have the power. This is not ended, Sylvia. I've released the model of your ship from the crystal, although they would have freed themselves soon. It's difficult to control so many things in so little time. Here. You must go before she finds the weapon is missing. They're not your men anymore. They belong to Sylvia. I can no longer control them or her. She's irrational. The strain of adopting to your form, the insatiable desire for sensation and experience. She's a great danger and it was not necessary. We could have entered your galaxy in peace. We used the transmuter. There's no time to explain now. She means to destroy us all. There might still be a chance. Quickly. Come. I think I can stop her. It's my problem. She's one of my kind. Come quickly. No! Get back. Get back. Get back! Get back! Get back! Go. Go!"

5762,TOS,episode 37,SPOCK,"Something wrong? Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has only been aboard seventy two hours. Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments. I see. I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic. That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of your beads and rattles. Interesting. Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is, we could extinguish ourselves. And most sophisticated. He simply appears to have turned himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant. He did not pay royalties. The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging. You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive. Then I'm unable to discern your problem. Whom do you serve now? We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently. There must be a central control system which guides the entire android population. Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual device. Did I understand there are more than two hundred thousand of you? This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you controlled through this device? Oh, that's quite understandable. 263 Captain, I've just had a most fascinating meeting with Norman, and I'm convinced I've discovered a very important inconsistency. He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd. Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited quantity. Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled. 471 Fascinating. I'm curious, Norman. Just how do you intend to stop them? Eminently practical. Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish it. Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and they'll be able to leave orbit. I asked them. Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred thousand of them. There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies, Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman. To function as they do, each android mind must be one component of a mass brain linked through a central locus. That would seem logical. What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only, opportunity. I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents. Of course. Your computations would inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of dimension with dimension. 27 Thank you. 210 I love you. However, I hate you. 210 Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are identical. Fascinating. Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of the tree. Now it is time to get to work on the root. Affirmative. Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad. Are you sure your circuits are registering correctly? Your ears are green. Very well, Captain. I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are you ready? Be careful. I would not want you to drop it. I believe they are all immobilised, Captain. That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy? Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans. The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again."

Just immortality. No, they're lying. It's a trick. Doctor McCoy injected something into Harry Mudd to make him look sick. It's a trick to get back on board and sabotage the ship. 1 Because I want an android body. I want immortality. I'll live forever, Captain. I'll be young and beautiful. 1 Thank you. 1 I half believed it myself. SCOTT; Well, the androids were expecting an attempt, and now we've made it. Thank you, kind sir. 2"

There's something wrong about a man who never smiles, whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job, and who won't talk about his background. Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan. The ears make all the difference. Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone. Besides, he has avoided two appointments that I've made for his physical exam without reason. Oh, I find that shocking. Harry, what's this? Dead? That's very interesting. You leave your wife and then bring her along. Then your makers weren't humanoid? I think Mister Chekov's right. We are in a lot of trouble. Jim, you should see the research facilities. They've got a lab down there that. Well, I could spend the rest of my life studying it. I wouldn't be bored, I can tell you that. I did. And you can forget it. They're perfect, flawless, mentally and physically. No weaknesses, perfectly disciplined. No vices, no fears, no faults. Just a sense of purpose. Believe me, there's nothing tougher to overcome, even among humans. How do you know so much? Oh. You wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself. He is dying. 1 Completely inner directed. Oblivious to everything. All right, it's worked so far, but we're not out yet. You offer us only well-being. Suffering, in torment and pain. Labouring without end. He's dead. Easy now. Oh, he's caught it! Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock. Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours. Logical, unemotional, completely pragmatic. And we poor, irrational humans whipped them in a fair fight. Now you'll find yourself back among us illogical humans again."

You're the cause of all this, are you? Aye, sir. And I stayed until that female gargantua threw me into the transporter beams. Absolutely fantastic. Hand-worked to the finest tolerances, microvision, and a nanopulse laser. I've never seen the like before. Captain, you should see this shop! Why, they have facilities we've never even thought of. What did they offer you, Uhura? Well, Captain, androids and robots, they're just not capable of independent, creative thought. How does it look? Food and drink and happiness mean nothing to us. We must be about our job. Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens. I canna go on! I'm tired of happiness. I'm tired of comfort and pleasure. I'm ready! Kill me! Kill me!

Intruder alert, deck eight, auxiliary control. Lieutenant Uhura, have Mister Spock report to the bridge. What's the imposed course, Mister Sulu? Kirk here. Any sign of the intruder? Find him. Kirk out. Mister Spock, we seem to be taking an unscheduled ride. Mister Sulu, cut in emergency manual monitor. I want the override broken. Emergency manual monitor, report. This is Captain Kirk. Acknowledge. Emergency manual monitor, this is the captain. Report. Acknowledge. This is the captain. Scotty, acknowledge. Scotty, what's going on down there? Kirk to Engineering. This is the captain. Scotty, report. Scotty, the intruder is in your area. What's going on down there? Scotty! Scotty. Scotty. Scotty? Security, the intruder is in the engineering section. Have all units converge on that point. Cut power. Spock, take over. Tell Security we've found the intruder. Do you mind telling me what this is all about, mister? Spock? Who are you? You require? Who and what are we? An android. Who sent you? It seems we're going to take a little trip. Captain's log. Stardate 4513.3. After having been taken over by an android, the Enterprise has been under way at warp seven for four days. Now we are entering orbit around a planet which has never been charted. Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise. I must say that's a gracious invitation. And what is that word? I don't believe it. Harry Mudd. Ruler? Harry, I want control of my ship returned immediately. We have no intention of staying as your guests. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Oh, do I know him. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief Swindler and con man Liar and rogue. He belongs in jail, which is where I thought I left you, Mudd. Mudd, I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate the trigger mechanism and free my ship. I'm telling you now. All right, I'll listen. What are you telling? Harry Mudd, you're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble. I want navigational control restored, my ship released. All right, Harry, explain. How did you get here? We left you in custody after that affair on the Rigel mining planet. Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents? Who caught you? Yes. Who caught you? And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans. That's what I would have done. He broke jail. He stole a spaceship. They fired at him. Go on, get on with it, Harry. They picked a fine representative. I think not, Harry. Who? Yes. My ship. 2 Norman, who created you? What became of them? Then some of your makers survive. All right. We might later. In the meantime, would you mind leaving us? Because we don't like you. Now. Well, opinions? That's a great help, Mister Chekov. Bones? Spock. And if you say we're in a lot of trouble. Try and find it. The rest of you, look around, learn everything you can. I'll see what else I can find out from Mister Mudd. Let's go. Norman is behind a console whilst two Hermans stand by.) Very impressive. I must say, I like the styling. Don't you believe in male androids, Harry? Don't lose your head, Bones. Nobody's staying anywhere. Scotty, you were ordered to stay aboard. What does she mean, the last one? Are you out of your mind? You can't beam down an entire crew of a spaceship. Somebody has to be on board. Harry, Harry, you'll never get away with it. Starfleet. I'm trying not to. Yes, I know. That's what worries me. How will my crew react in a world where they can have everything they want simply by asking for it. Is that the way you're going to do it, Mudd? Hit my people at their weakest point? All right, here we are, birds in a gilded cage. The question is, how do we get out of here? All right. We're getting back to the ship, and don't you forget it. Straighten up! This may be a gilded cage filled with everything you always wanted, but it's still a cage. We don't belong here. We belong on that ship up there. 471 No. Yes. My ship. 471 To respond in that area. Yes, I know. 471 Alice, give us back our ship to please us. Return us to our ship because we desire it. 471 But we're unhappy here. 471 We want the Enterprise. 471 No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her. 471 Interesting. Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of the androids? Yes. That's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose. Mudd, a few questions I want to ask you. Yes. My ship. Harry, I think they have something else in mind. We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human. And maybe that's the word that best explains us. The whole galaxy controlled by your kind? So far this thing has had its amusing aspects, but that threat the androids made about taking over all the humans in the galaxy is not very funny. Why shouldn't they answer our questions? They don't think we can do anything to stop them. All right, what have we got to work with? I agree. What in your opinion does direct them? Norman. When I told one of the Alices that the Enterprise was a lovely lady and we loved her, she said, Norman, co-ordinate. Why Norman? Unless Named Norman. Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind. And the glowing badges, they indicate the mind in operation. Yes, logical. That's what it is. And that in turn gives us a weapon that we can use against them. We must use wild, insane, irrational illogic aimed right at Norman! Let's get to the point. Harry, you said you wanted to help. Do you? That's fine, Harry. The androids will be expecting us to make a break for it, and that's where you come in. Nothing, Harry. Just go to sleep. Oh, Harry. I do believe you're putting on weight. 1 We have a medical problem. Your ex-Lord, Harry Mudd. 1 We are caring for him, but our doctor needs his medical equipment aboard the Enterprise. 1 You are programmed to serve. If we're not allowed access to our medical equipment, Harry Mudd will die. He will cease to function. You will have failed to serve. 1 Oh, yes. Uhura, why did you tell her? Uhura. Beautiful! Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland. 118+2 Yes. Your attention. 2 They're celebrating. 118 Their captivity. Do you enjoy the music? 118 She likes him. Mister Chekov. The floor is no place for an officer. Attention! Now stand absolutely still. That's better, Mister Chekov. 118 Your statement is illogical. Good. I wonder how Spock's doing. Well? If Norman is the control centre, he should be in a bind by what we've done. If we can overload him further, we should be able to immobilise all of them. Does everybody remember what to do? Acknowledged. I want you to surrender. No, we are stronger. I'll prove it to you. Can you harm a man that you're programmed to serve? Why not? Scotty. Scotty's dead. He had too much happiness. But now he's happier he's dead, and we'll miss him. Let us hear it for our poor, dead friend. What is a man but that lofty spirit, that sense of enterprise, that devotion to something that cannot be sensed, cannot be realised but only dreamed! The highest reality. How did you like it? Our logic is to be illogical. That is our advantage. Mister Spock, it is time. The explosive. Watch it! Watch it! No? Observe. Fore! Boom! Are you all right? He lied. Everything Harry tells you is a lie. Remember that. Everything Harry tells you is a lie. I am not programmed to respond in that area. Good. Why, thank you. A partnership arrangement? You and me? I've got something else in mind. Let's go. Touché, Bones. Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this planet. No, you're an irritant. You'll stay here and provide a first-class example to the androids of a human failure. They'll learn by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future. As long as you continue to be an irritant, Harry. It's up to you. Yes, you are. Oh, there's one more thing, Harry. We've programmed a special android attendant to take care of your every need. She'll help you find an incentive to work with the androids and not exploit them. Yes. 1 Goodbye, Harry.

Well, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem there. Alice. Now, now, now, now, Jamie boy, let's have no unauthorised communications. Come now. Entrepreneur. Did I leave you with that impression? And thereby hangs a tale, yes. But look around you, Kirk. Quite a place, isn't it? I hope you're all going to enjoy it. I shall do that, Kirk, when I'm ready. And I do the telling on this planet, Kirk, old boy. You do the listening. Merely that you might as well start enjoying yourselves. It's really a very, very nice place, and you're all going to be here quite probably for the rest of your lives. Sorry. That'd be against the law. My law. Decreed by Mudd the First. Voted in by the resident population. Lovely, aren't they? You must admit, Kirk, that I still retain my eye for beauty. I decreed that I should always be surrounded by it, and my decrees always come to pass. I've had five hundred of them made up to attend me. All of them identical, beautiful, compliant, obedient. I have a fondness for this particular model, Mister Spock, which you, unfortunately, are ill-equipped to appreciate. Yes, well, I organised a technical information service bringing modern industrial techniques to backward planets, making available certain valuable patents to struggling young civilisations throughout the galaxy. Well, actually, Kirk, as a defender of the free enterprise system, I found myself in a rather ambiguous conflict as a matter of principle. Knowledge, sir, should be free to all. That, sir, is an outrageous assumption. I sold the Denebians all the rights to a Vulcan fuel synthesiser. How'd you know? It's typical police mentality. They've got no sense of humour. They arrested me. Worse than that. Do know what the penalty for fraud is on Deneb Five? The key word in your entire peroration, Mister Spock, was, death. Barbarians. Well, of course, I left. I borrowed transportation. The patrol reacted in a hostile manner. They've no respect for private property. They damaged the bloody spaceship. Well, I got away, but I couldn't navigate, so I wandered out through unmapped space, and here I found Mudd. Spock, you're going to love it here. They all talk just the way you do. Yes, well, right, laddybuck. So here I am in a planet with over two hundred thousand hard-working, happy androids, all of whom exist merely to serve my every whim. It's absolute paradise. They won't let me go. They want to study me. They want to learn more about human beings. Watch your tongue, lad. You're talking about Mudd the First. Well, anyway, I ran out of ideas. I simply ran out of things for them to do, and they insisted that I bring them more human beings. They need human beings to serve, to study. So I had to promise them a prime sample. A starship captain. Bright, loyal, fearless and imaginative. Any captain would have done. I was lucky to get you. So you are going to take over for me here, and I can get off this rock and back to civilisation. You misunderstand me, lad. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. You've no choice. Show them to their quarters. and Ah. That, gentlemen, is a shrine to the memory of my beloved Stella. Stella, my wife. Oh, no, no, no. Merely deserted. You see, gentlemen, behind every great man there is a woman urging him on. And so it was with my Stella. She urged me on into outer space. Not that she meant to, but with her continual, eternal, confounded nagging. Well, I think of her constantly, and every time I do, I go further out into space. I had the androids construct a perfect replica of Stella so that I could gaze upon her and rejoice in her absence. Gentlemen, attend. Stella, dear. Shut up. Marvellous, isn't it? I finally have the last word with her, and with you. They were, of course, made to my personal specifications, as indeed were the Maisie series, the Trudie series, and particularly the Annabel series. Male? Well, I suppose they have their uses. Immortality and eternal beauty. I'm so glad you enjoyed it, Doctor. I do so admire a man who devotes himself to knowledge. Stubborn, Kirk. Stubborn. Splendid. Splendid. Welcome to Mudd, Mister Scott. Didn't I tell you, Kirk? I beamed a few dozen androids up to your ship. They've been sending your crew to the surface for the past couple of hours. They're all down now. There is an entire crew aboard. An entire crew of androids. They learn very quickly, Captain. The fact is, I've taken over your whole ship. There's nothing you can do about it. Well, who's to stop me? But now, Captain, now I have a ship of my own as fast as any in the fleet, so how will they catch me, eh? Just think of it, laddybuck. Harry Mudd with his own crew of lovelies aboard your vessel. Think about that. Alice. Afraid I won't have time to answer them. My bags are all packed. The androids will take the Enterprise out of orbit in less than twenty four hours. But it's been a real pleasure having you here, Kirk. Is there anything I can get for you? You're a stubborn fellow, aren't you? But I don't mind. I don't mind that at all. Because I'll be leaving here quickly enough, and then you can be stubborn at your own leisure. One last time. Stella, dear. Shut up! Alice Number 2, my little love. Will you have my bags transported up to the ship? What? Why not? Yes, but that's what I'm saying. Put my bags on the ship. Now, look here. You can't do that! Now, listen. To serve us, you must obey us. Alice number One, obey me. Put my bags on that ship! Take my word for it, they can. You're so smart, Kirk, you and this pointy-eared thinking machine of yours. Well, you'd better do something because I'm as anxious to get off this ruddy rock as you are. Oh, yes. Captain, you sing and dance as well as anyone I've ever seen, but what the devil are you talking about? Opportunity? Now, listen, Spock, you may be a wonderful science officer, but believe me, you couldn't sell fake patents to your mother. Forget it. Captain, the kind of a wholesome, antiseptic galaxy that these androids would run would be purgatory for a man like me. What can I do? What do you mean? Oh, now, now wait a minute, gentlemen. No, what I, I, had in mind was actually more in the line of a few words of sage counsel as it were. Advice But you already have, Norman, laddy. Human beings do not survive on bread alone, you poor soulless creature, but on the nourishments of liberty, for what indeed is a man without freedom? Naught but a mechanism trapped in the cogwheels of eternity. Brilliant! Bravo, bravo, Captain! Don't panic. Women and children first. Mister Spock, isn't that too much for our purposes? Aye, aye! Detonator. Fuse. Primer. Mashie. I lied. Listen to this carefully, Norman. I am lying. Kirk, old man, I'm beginning to develop considerable respect for you. Would you consider entering a partnership arrangement with me? I've got some ideas. Yes. I've never heard of anything so revolting. We'll soon get to the bottom of this. Kirk, now what's this I hear about my having to stay here? But what do I do? Kirk, I'm no scientist. How long? I suppose that taking everything into consideration, as it were, and noting all the different possibilities, I could manage. And as detention sentences go, this one isn't too uncomfortable. And I'm back in the galaxy again! I call that unexpectedly civil of you, Captain. Shut up! I order you. Shut up, Stella! 1 Kirk, you can't do this. 2 It's inhuman. 2 No. Number five hundred? No, no, no. 500 Kirk. It's inhuman. Mercy."

I have connected the matter-antimatter pods to the main navigational bank. A trigger relay is now in operation. Any attempts to alter course will result in immediate destruction of this vessel. I assure you we are no threat to humanity or humanoid life. We mean you no harm, but we require your ship. I control the trigger relay, sir. I cannot be overcome by physical means, and if you attempt to use your phasers, the trigger relay will be activated. We shall continue on our present course for approximately four solar days, at which time we shall arrive at our destination. I am not programmed to respond in that area. Captain Kirk. The following individuals will be transported down to our planet. Yourself, science officer, medical officer, communications officer and navigator. If you do not come with me, your engines will be destroyed and you will remain in orbit here forever. There is a word. Among us there is no corresponding meaning, but it seems to mean something to you humans. Please. Our planet's surface is what you classify as K-type, adaptable for humans by use of pressure domes and life-support systems. I have brought them. 1 Yes, my Lord Mudd. You'll find this quite comfortable. Your quarters are down the hall. 1 The makers designed us. They came from the galaxy of Andromeda. They were, as you say, quite humanoid, but, unlike your civilisation, robots were common. We performed the necessary service functions and freed our makers to evolve a perfect social order. Our home planet's sun became a nova. Only a few exploratory outposts survived. This unit, myself, was part of one such outpost in your galaxy. No, Captain. They died over the stretch of time. We lacked it for a long time. 1 I trust you are enjoying yourself, Mister Spock. It is our central control complex. Two hundred and seven thousand, eight hundred and nine. I am not programmed to respond in this area. You may command us to make anything for you, or do the work yourself for pleasure. You may have the services of any number of craftsmen, exclusive use of the computer facilities. Anything. We only wish to make you happy and comfortable, Captain. If we are to serve your kind, we must understand you. Our Lord, Harry Mudd was only one example for us. Now we are learning a great deal from all of you. We can no longer take your orders, Harry Mudd. Our makers were wise. They programmed us to serve. You are correct, Captain. Harry Mudd is flawed, even for a human being. We recognised this from the beginning but used his knowledge to obtain more specimens. Your species is self-destructive. You need our help. We will not harm you, but we will take the starship, and you will remain on this planet. We cannot allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to have free run of the galaxy. We shall serve them. Their kind will be eager to accept our service. Soon they will become completely dependent upon us. 99 We shall take care of them. Yes, Captain. And we shall serve them and you will be happy, and controlled. What are you doing here? That is illogical. We can move more quickly than you. We are invulnerable to attack. We are much stronger. No. That is contradictory. It is not logical. Mister Spock. Explain. You cannot have killed him. You have no weapons. That is irrational. Illogical. Dreams are not real. There is no explosive. But there was no explosion. What? You say you are lying, but if everything you say is a lie then you are telling the truth, but you cannot tell the truth because everything you say is a lie. You lie. You tell the truth. But you cannot for. Illogical! Illogical! Please explain.   You are human. Only humans can explain their behaviour. Please explain."

Heading directly toward us at warp speed. Vaguely like a cloud of ionised hydrogen, but with strong erratic electrical impulses. Helm does not answer, Captain. Cut, Captain. Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward Gamma Canaris region. Gravity is similar to Earth. Most unusual in view of its size. The bulk of the body seems to be iron and nickel. More than an asteroid. Like a small planetoid, I should say. Possibly a remnant of a planet breakup. Totally suitable for human life. Most unusual. Unlikely. In fact, Captain, I would say quite impossible. Precisely. Obviously. The ionised cloud. Fascinating. Correct. Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment. You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again? You don't mind if we continue to try? You built this, Mister Cochrane? Not bad. Captain, Doctor. We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane. There was an entity out there and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here. Please explain. You were injured? I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir. Meanwhile, would you please explain exactly what this Companion of yours is? The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known galaxy. Planets were named after him. Great universities, cities. True, his body was never found. If so, you wear your age very well. Captain. These instruments, they date from the time indicated. From your ship, Mister Cochrane? You ask me to find a weapon. Do you intend to destroy it? Quite clear, Captain. Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened. Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned electric shock of respectable voltage. Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is simple electricity. Quite correct, Doctor. Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch, and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce. It cannot fail. We may simply render it powerless. There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its powers. All right. Yes, Captain? The translator is for use with more congruent life forms. It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception Then it translates its findings into English. Quite ready, Captain. Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation. Then it is not a zookeeper. This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it about its nature, its history. A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so much. Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it obviously exists. The Companion loves you. Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years been emotionally satisfying, eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been quite beneficial. Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude. But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to react like a human. Companion, you do not have the power to create life. Commissioner Hedford was dying. Then you are both here, in the one body? Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially irrational. But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality. You'll both grow old here and finally die."

6033,TOS,episode 38,UHURA,"Mister Scott. Computer central reports that we're coming up on the co-ordinates of the last established position of the shuttlecraft. If the shuttlecraft powered away, Mister Scott, but if it were just towed? What do you think it means, Mister Scott? Well, I'd feel a lot better if it were a little more definite. If there are no further traces, how are we going to follow them? It's a big galaxy, Mister Scott. Mister Scott, there are thousands of them out there they could be on, if they're on any of them at all. Mister Scott, it's the Captain."

6035,TOS,episode 38,TRANSPORTER,
6036,TOS,episode 38,MCCOY,"Jim. No change. Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet. Sakuro's disease is extremely rare. The chances of anyone contracting it are literally billions to one. Jim, we've got to get Miss Hedford to the Enterprise. Her condition. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. Some krypton, argon, neon. Temperature seventy five degrees Fahrenheit. Practically identical to Earth atmosphere. Jim, I just took a tricording sweep, and I got the same readings almost as Spock got when we were pulled off course. I think so, only it reads here on the surface with us. It's in that direction, and it doesn't read solid. It's more unstable, tenuous, like a collection of gases. Pleasure. He's human, Jim. Everything checks out perfectly. Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much. What's that? Familiar? Now that you mention it, he does. No temperature yet, but we've got to get under way soon, Jim. I guarantee you, it will develop. What are we going to do? Do you feel hot? It was quite a hike here. You're tired. Just take it easy for a while. Temperature, Captain. First sign. That's a pretty far out story. But that's impossible. Zefram Cochrane died a hundred and fifty years ago. How do you feel? You're running a little temperature. Perhaps you should lie down. All right. Try to relax. Jim, it's started, the fever. It's over a hundred, and it's climbing. A matter of hours, that's all. Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining. No, it's more than that. Are you all right? Spock! Are you all right? It attacked you? Oh, yes. I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mister Spock, but am I correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity can be shorted out? We understand how you feel, Mister Cochrane, but it has to be done. Stop it! You're killing them! Stop it, please! Stop it! You're choking them! Let them go. You're choking them! Stop it! You all right, Jim? Spock? What kind of talk is that? It isn't your fault. Maybe you're a soldier so often that you forget you're also trained to be a diplomat. Why not try a carrot instead of a stick? Yes, for the worse. Ship's Log. Stardate 3219.8. Lieutenant Commander Scott recording in the absence of Captain Kirk. A shuttlecraft bearing the Captain, the first officer, Chief Surgeon McCoy, and Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford is now definitely overdue for a rendezvous with the Enterprise. We are attempting to backtrack it. You don't? A blind man could see it with a cane. You're not a pet. You're not a specimen kept in a cage. You're a lover. There's nothing disgusting about it. It's just another life form, that's all. You get used to those things. Right here, Miss Hedford. You just rest. What did you hope to gain by that, Jim? I don't understand it. She's not sick at all. She's perfectly healthy. Heart like a hammer, respiration normal, blood pressure normal. This is medically impossible. Jim, what about that war on Epsilon Canaris Three?"
6037,TOS,episode 38,GREEN,
6038,TOS,episode 38,NANCY,"Small thanks to the Starfleet. I should've received the proper inoculations ahead of time. I was sent to Epsilon Canaris Three to prevent a war, Doctor. Thanks to the inefficiency of the medical branch of the Starfleet, I've been forced to leave before my job was done. How soon will we rendezvous with that ship of yours, Captain? What's happening? I demand to know. I insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the Enterprise. Just how long am I supposed to stay inside, Captain? How perceptive of you to notice I needed one. Must you keep it so terribly hot in here? I feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged. I'll rest later, Doctor. Thank you. Terrible. How should I feel? Doctor, will you please just leave me alone. It's the heat. No! No! No! That's disgusting! We're not animals! No! Oh, no! It's inhuman! No! No! Doctor. Doctor. I heard him. He was loved and he resents it. No. I don't want to die. I've been good at my job, but I've never been loved. Never. What kind of life is that? Not to be loved, never to have shown love? And he runs away from love. Ship's log, stardate 3220.3. Lieutenant Commander Scott reporting in lieu of the Captain and the first officer. We are continuing our search for the missing shuttlecraft. Zefram Cochrane. We understand. We are here. Both of us. Those you knew as the Commissioner and the Companion. We are both here. That is for the Maker of all things. That part of us was too weak to hold on. In a moment, there would have been no continuing. Now we're together. We are one. Zefram, we frighten you. We've never frightened you before. Loneliness. This is loneliness. Oh, what a bitter thing. Oh, Zefram, it's so sad. How do you bear it, this loneliness? That will not be necessary, Captain. Your vehicle will operate as before, so will the communications device. We could do nothing now to stop you. You said we would not know love because we were not human. Now we are human. We'll know the change of days. We will know death. But to touch the hand of man, nothing is as important. Part of me understands. Part does not. But it pleases me. Oh, let me walk, Zefram. Let me feel the earth against my feet. Let me feel the warmth of the sun on my face. You beside me. Let me feel these things. I can't go with you, Zefram. My life emanates from this place. If I should leave it for more than a tiny march of days, I'll cease to exist. I must return, even as you must consume matter to maintain your life. The joy of this hour. I am pleased. You must be free, Zefram Cochrane."
6039,TOS,episode 38,OPERATOR,
6040,TOS,episode 38,SULU,"Steady. No, Mister Scott, bearing three ten mark thirty five just cleared. No antimatter residue. Bearing two ten mark forty. Strong particle concentration. We're on it, Mister Scott. Course laid in, sir. Particle density decreasing. Gone, sir. No readings. Approaching what seems to be an asteroid belt, sir. Scanners report approximately seven thousand bodies of sizes running from types A to N. Approximately thirty four percent of the bodies of atmospherian types H to M. Course two twenty four mark twelve. fifty seven minutes."
6041,TOS,episode 38,SCOTT,"Thank you, Lieutenant. All scanners, spherical sweep. Range, maximum. They'll have to pick it up. There'd still be traces of residual matter floating around, Lieutenant. Lay on that course. Maintain scanning. Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu. The shuttlecraft was on schedule until it was shy five hours of rendezvous. Then something happened. It didn't wreck. There was no debris. There's no trace of expelled internal atmosphere, no residual radioactivity. Ah, it's. Something took over. Tractor beams maybe. Something. They dragged it away on the heading we're now on. We stay on this course, see what comes up. Aye. Atmosphere count? All right, then. We'll do it the hard way. All sensors set for life form registration. Automatic selection. That's right, Lieutenant. Thousands. And we'll look them over one by one. Put him on. Lock on to his co-ordinates. Captain, this is Scotty. Are you all right? The helm is computing your position now, Captain. We'll be there in 57 minutes, sir. What happened, Captain? We're locked in, Captain. Standard orbit established. Shuttlecraft bay standing by to receive you."
6042,TOS,episode 38,KIRK,"Thank you, Mister Spock. How is she, Doc? Commissioner, I can assure you that once we reach the Enterprise, with its medical facilities, we'll have you back to your job in time for you to prevent that war. In exactly four hours, twenty one minutes, Commissioner. Yes? That's odd. I've never seen anything like that before. Staying right with us. Sensor readings, Mister Spock. We've got it. Neither do the pods. Communications are dead. Building overload. Cut all power relays. You already know as much as we do, Miss Hedford. Whatever that thing is outside, it's yanked us off course from the Enterprise. I know, Bones, but there's nothing I can do about it. Miss Hedford, we'll do what we can, when we can. At the moment, we're helpless. You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride. Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please, come in. Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please. It's no good. We're not transmitting. Bones? Spock? All right, we get out and get up. Issue phasers. Bones, maintain full alert. Commissioner, you'll stay inside. That's a very good question. I wish I could answer it. All right. Let's go. Take a look around, Bones. Nothing wrong and nothing works. There must be a reason. Let's look a little further. Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is. We're real enough. From the Federation. I'm Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. This is my first officer Mister Spock. Chief Surgeon Leonard McCoy. Oh, and excuse me, Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford. Mister Cochrane. We were forced off our course and taken here by some force we couldn't identify. What about you, Cochrane? How did you get here? If you don't mind, Mister Cochrane, I'd like more than just a statement that you were marooned here. It's a long way off the beaten path. Yes, she is. And you've been out of circulation quite a while. The principles may be new to you. Mister Spock, why don't you explain our methods of propulsion to Mister Cochrane? I've noticed something else. He looks familiar. I can't quite place him, but. What about Miss Hedford? Take Cochrane up on his offer. All the comforts of home indeed, Mister Cochrane. Where'd you get the antiques? Not that much. Yes, I know. It means we're running out of time. What was that? You'll find I have a very low tolerance level where the safety of my people are concerned. We find you out here, where no human has any business being. We were virtually hijacked in space and brought here. Now I'm not just requesting an explanation, Mister. I'm demanding one. The what? You seem perfectly all right now. What was the matter? You were what? Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name? Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centuri, the discoverer of the space warp? Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane? You say this Companion found you and rejuvenated you? What were you doing in space at the age of eighty seven? How long do we have? Mister Cochrane, you say you were brought here a hundred and fifty years ago? You don't look over thirty five. You say you can communicate with it. Perhaps you can find out what we're doing here. You wouldn't mind telling us? I already don't like it. You mean you brought us here? Spock, run additional tricorder readings. Learn anything you can. Find me a weapon to use against this thing. I intend to do whatever's necessary to get us off this planet and Commissioner Hedford to the hospital. If the Companion stands in the way, then we push it out of the way. Clear, Spock? Very well. You have your orders. Mister Cochrane, if you left here, what would happen to you? Do you want to leave here? We're on a thousand planets and spreading out. We cross fantastic distances and everything's alive, Cochrane. Life everywhere. We estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life. We haven't begun to map them. Interesting? It's all out there waiting for you, but we'll need your help to get away. You seem to think this Companion of yours can do almost anything. Could it cure her? How do you communicate with it? We've got to try. We're helpless. See if it can do something. How do you do it? Bones, what do you make of that? Exactly what I think. Not exactly like a pet owner speaking to a beloved animal, would you say? Agreed. More like love. Well? Then she'll die. It troubles you, Cochrane? It's also keeping you prisoner. We're getting out of here, Cochrane. Face up to it. I'll do anything I have to to save all of our lives. Please. Outside. Nor it ours. Now. Yeah. Cochrane got it off of us, but I don't know whether he did us a favour or not. How do you fight a thing like that? I've got a ship up there somewhere, responsibility for four lives here, one of them dying because of me. I'm in command, Bones. It makes it my fault. How do you fight a thing like that? Spock. The universal translator on the shuttlecraft. We can try that, talk to that thing. Adjust it, change it. The trouble with immortality is it's boring. Adjusting the translator will give you something to do. Right down your alley, Spock. Get it here and get to work. That thing is still out there. Better go that way. Any change? There are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all intelligent life. This device instantaneously compares the frequency of brainwave patterns, selects those ideas and concepts it recognises, and then provides the necessary grammar. With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end. Not one hundred percent efficient, but nothing ever is. Ready, Mister Spock? Mister Cochrane, call the Companion. Companion. We wish to talk to you. Feminine. No doubt about it. I'm way ahead of you. No. A lover. Companion. It is wrong to keep us here against our will. One of us will cease to exist if we don't get her to a place where we can care for her. Companion, try to understand. It is the nature of our species to be free, just as it is your nature to stay here. We will cease to exist in captivity. This isn't a classroom. I'm trying to get us out of here. This isn't the time. Companion, what you offer us is not continuation. It is non=existence. We will cease to exist. Even the man will cease to exist. We didn't. The idea of male and female are universal constants, Cochrane. There's no doubt about it. The Companion is female. What are you complaining about? It kept you alive. Companion, do you love the man? Is he important to you, more important than anything? Is he as though he were a part of you? He will not continue. He will cease to exist. By your feeling for him, you are condemning him to an existence he will find unbearable. He will cease to exist. You speak of his body. I speak of his spirit. Companion, inside the shelter, a female of our species is dying. She will not continue. That is what will happen to the man unless you release all of us. Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. You take away all obstacles. Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die. You regard the man only as a toy. You amuse yourself with him. But you can't really love him. You haven't the slightest knowledge of love, the total union of two people. You are the Companion. He is the man. You are two different things. You can't join. You can't love. You may keep him here forever, but you will always be separate, apart from him. Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it. Love sometimes expresses itself in sacrifice. I thought maybe if she loved him, she'd let him go. I tried. Bones? What? Bones? We? Spock, check out the shuttlecraft. Engine, communications, everything. Go ahead, Cochrane We have a few things to do. Perfectly all right. Can you get a fix on us. Very good. I'll continue transmitting. Assume standard orbit when you arrive. We'll transport up in the shuttlecraft. Interesting story, Scotty. I can't tell you now because, quite frankly, I don't know how it's going to end. Kirk out. Stand by, Scotty. The Enterprise is waiting, Mister Cochrane. Think it over, Mister Cochrane. There's a whole galaxy out there waiting to honour you. Are you sure? All the best. Not a word, Mister Cochrane. Well, I'm sure the Federation can find another woman somewhere who'll stop that war. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

The man needs others of his species. That is why you are here. The man must continue. Your bodies have stopped their peculiar degeneration. There will be nothing to harm you. You will continue, and the man will continue. This is necessary. Your impulses are illogical. This communication is useless. The man must continue. Therefore, you will continue. It is necessary. I do not understand. He is part of me. The man must continue. He does not age. He remains forever. I do not understand. You are wrong. The man is the centre of all things. I care for him.

6281,TOS,episode 38,COCHRANE,"Hello! Hello! Hello! Are you real? I mean, I'm not imagining you, am I? You speak English. Earth people? The F? Well, it doesn't matter. I'm Cochrane. I've been marooned here who knows how long. If you only knew how good it is to see you. And a woman. A beautiful one at that. You're a Vulcan, aren't you? Doctor. Ma'am. You're food to a starving man. All of you. Hey, that's a nice ship. Simple and clean. Been trying to get her to go again? Well, forget it. It won't work. Well, I wouldn't know anything about that. Not a chance. There's some sort of dampening field down here. Power systems don't work. Take my word for it. Go right ahead. You've got plenty of time. Marooned, I told you. Look, we'll have lots of time to learn about each other. I have a small place over that way. All the comforts of home. I can even offer you a hot bath. That's right. That's why I'm so glad to see you. Look, I'll tell you everything you want to know, but not here. Your ship is sure a beauty. Yes. I had tools and supplies left over from my crash. Not Earth, but it's livable. I grow vegetables in the fields over that next ridge. Come on in. You mean my instruments? I imagine things have changed a lot since I crashed. The temperature's a constant seventy two degrees. Let me get you something cool to drink. Well, sometimes the light plays tricks on you. You'd be surprised what I've imagined I've seen around here sometimes. There's nothing to explain. All right. It was the Companion. That's what I call it. As a matter of fact, Captain, I didn't crash here. I was brought here in my disabled ship. I was almost dead. The Companion saved my life. I was dying, Mister Spock. I was an old man. Well, I don't know how it did it, but the Companion rejuvenated me, made me young again, like I am now. I told you, I don't know what it is. It exists, it lives, and I can communicate with it. Zefram. That's right, Captain. No, it's true. I was eighty seven years old when I came here. I was tired, Captain. I was going to die, and I wanted to die in space. That's all. You're looking at it, Mister Spock. I haven't aged. The Companion sees to that. I cannibalised it. The food, water, gardens, everything else I need the Companion gives me. Apparently, it creates it out of the native elements. I already know. You won't like it. You're here to keep me company. No, the Companion did. I told it I'd die of loneliness. I thought it would release me. Instead, it brought you here. I'd begin to age again, normally. Believe me, Captain, immortality consists largely of boredom. What's it like out there in the galaxy? How would you like to sleep for a hundred and fifty years and wake up in a new world? You've got it. I said it was very powerful. I don't know. It's on a non-verbal level, but I usually get my message across. I just sort of clear my mind and it comes. Yes. It kind of drains me a little, but I'm all right. The Companion can't do anything to help Miss Hedford. If there's anything I could do to help, I would, and I will, but we can expect nothing from the Companion. The Companion saved my life. It's taken care of me all these years. We've been very close in a way that's hard to explain. I suppose I even have an affection for it. I don't want it killed. But you don't know. You could kill it. I won't stand for that. I suppose from your point of view, you're right. All right. You want me to contact it? What was it they used to call it? The Judas goat? What's the theory behind this device? You mean it speaks? Captain, why did you build that translator with a feminine voice? But I heard I don't understand. I'm a what? Do you know what you're saying? For all these years, I've let something as alien as that crawl around inside me, into my mind, my feelings. That thing fed on me. It used me. It's disgusting. You're as bad as it is. Is this what the future holds? Men who have no notion of decency or morality? Maybe I'm a hundred and fifty years out of style, but I'm not going to be fodder for any inhuman monster. It's useless. I know. It's her. Don't you understand? It's the Companion. You're letting us go? You're very beautiful. I could explain many things. Everything will be an eye-opener to you. There's a thousand planets out there, a thousand races, and I'll show everything to you, soon as I learn my way around again. Maybe I can make up a little for everything you've done for me. Of course you can. You have to. You gave up everything to be human? But even if you stay here, you'll eventually die. Well, I can't just fly away and leave you here. You saved my life, took care of me. You loved me. I never understood. I do now. I can't take her away from here. If I do, she'll die. If I leave her, she'll die of loneliness. I owe everything to her. I can't leave her. I love her. Is that surprising? I have honours enough. That's been happening to men and women for a long time. I've got the feeling it's one of the pleasanter things about being human, as long as you grow old together. There's plenty of water here. The climate's good for growing things. I might try to plant a fig tree. A man's entitled to that, isn't he? It isn't gratitude, Captain. Now that I see her, touch her, I know that I love her. We'll have a lot of years together. They'll be happy ones. Captain, don't tell them about me."

We have departed Vulcan for the neutral planetoid code-named Babel. Since it is in our sector, the Enterprise has been assigned to transport ambassadors of Federation planets to this vitally important council. The issues of the council are politically complex, the passengers explosive. Humans smile with so little provocation. The situation between my father and myself has not changed. Yes, Captain? If you will excuse me, Captain. Not precisely, Doctor. On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and they have six-inch fangs. Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration is unfamiliar. Most unusual. Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours. Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate. Vessel changing course, heading toward us at high warp speed. Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten. Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times. Indeed, Captain? Interesting. Vulcans do not approve of violence. No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason. If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing. Logically and efficiently. Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical suspect. Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship's hull. Yes, it could adversely affect our mission. Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened. The ship's hull seems to have a high density level or is cloaked against sensor probes. It is manned, but sensors cannot make out specifics. I think it unlikely it is one of theirs. Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission. It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No standard references apply. Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is alien. Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect? I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach. My blood is T-negative, Doctor. It should be possible to filter out the human factors. Indeed. I would estimate the odds Doctor. Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan. But it does look promising. I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable. It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel Five. Miss Chapel? I underwent a physical examination last week. Would you pull those records, please? It would seem the only answer. Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor, have no logical alternative either. If you do not operate, Sarek will die. You now have the means to perform the operation. I am volunteering myself as the blood donor. I'll be at my station until you require me. . The Andorian pulls a knife and stabs Kirk before getting kicked unconscious.) Spock here. Captain? Captain? Captain? Captain's log, stardate 3843.4. First Officer Spock in temporary command. The captain has been critically wounded by one of the delegates to the Babel conference. The ship is on alert status. We are still being followed by the intruder vessel. I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner. No, Doctor. My first responsibility is to the ship. Our passengers' safety is by Starfleet order of first importance. We are being followed by an alien, possibly hostile, vessel. I cannot relinquish command under these circumstances. On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise personal privilege. I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian. He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug. He reveals nothing. I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan. Apparently Thelev did. I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the captain. There is no logic in Gav's murder. Come in. Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified. Any competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances. The circumstances are not normal. We're carrying over one hundred valuable Federation passengers. We're being pursued by an alien ship. We're subject to possible attack. There has been murder and attempted murder on board. I cannot dismiss my duties. I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would. Sarek understands my reason. Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to be a Vulcan? It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be. Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person? Mother I cannot. Captain? Captain, are you quite all right? I must see the captain. The alien ship. I've just realised that if their power utilisation curve is not the norm, it should be possible to identify them this way. Very important. Captain, I believe you'll find the alien I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor. Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the Coridan system. The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us. That ship was constructed for a suicide mission. Since they never intended to return to their home base, they could use one hundred percent power on their attacks. The thing I don't understand is why I didn't think of it earlier. That hardly seems likely. Emotional, isn't she? Indeed? Why did you marry her? Doctor, I'll return to my station now. Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy."

There wasn't enough of it. Sensors show nothing in the area, but it was a strong signal, as though it was very close. I've tried all frequencies and hooked in the universal translator. No response, sir. KIRK; Maintain translator broadcast. Check records for authorised ships. Captain, Starfleet acknowledges report on our situation and confirms no authorised Federation vessel in this quadrant. Captain? I picked up the last part of a transmission. Just like that other one. I put the recorder and the directional locator on it immediately. Sir, the directional locator indicates reception point somewhere within the body of this ship. Yes, sir. None, sir. Captain, I'm picking up the alien signal again, but it's coming from inside the Enterprise. From the brig, sir. Captain, the intercoms are jammed. All the ambassadors are asking what's going on.

6304,TOS,episode 39,MCCOY,"Dress uniforms, spit and polish. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to stand this. I feel like my neck's in a sling. Sure. A formal reception tonight, a hundred and fourteen delegates aboard for two weeks, thirty two of them ambassadors, half of them mad at the other half, and the whole lot touchier than a raw antimatter pile over this Coridan question. How does that Vulcan salute go? That hurts worse than the uniform. Ambassador. Mister Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this conference was called. Forgive my curiosity, but as a doctor, I'm interested in Vulcan physiology. Isn't it unusual for a Vulcan to retire at your age? After all, you're only a hundred and two. Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human than you let on. Mrs. Sarek, I know about the rigorous training of the Vulcan youth, but tell me, did he ever run and play like the human children, even in secret? Sehlat? A teddy bear? A teddy bear. His neck was broken. By an expert. Well, from the nature and location of the break, I'd say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly. Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect? His neck was broken, Mister Ambassador, by what Spock describes as tal-shaya. It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology, but I believe it's something to do with his cardiovascular system. I don't know that yet either. As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valve. It's similar to a heart attack in a human. But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell without an operation. Mrs. Sarek, has he had any previous attacks? I'm not sure. It's tough enough on a human. On a Vulcan, an ordinary operation's out of the question. Well, I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here. Well, the procedure they're discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient. Yes. Yes, I'd say that's rare. Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock. It would kill you. Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood. I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian. Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental. Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level. Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before. Oh, I've studied the anatomical types. I know where all the organs are. But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience. So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will. A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body. It's only experimental. It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him. What has that got It could damage you internally. It could kill you. I'm sorry, Spock. I can't sanction it. It's a bad wound. Punctured left lung. A centimetre or so lower, it'd have gone through the heart. Spock, your father is much worse. There's no longer a choice. I have to operate immediately. We can begin as soon as you're prepared. What? You can turn command over to Scotty. Now let that be a lesson to you. Just lie there and be happy you're still alive. Not good. If I could only operate. I was. When you became injured, Spock assumed command. He's going to stay there until you're back on your feet, even if it costs Sarek his life. Regulations. Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again. I've certified him physically fit, Mister Spock. Now since I have an operation to perform and both of us are required Readings, Nurse. I wish I knew whether that was good or bad. Initiate sterile field. Where do you think you're going? My patients don't walk out in the middle of an operation. So is your father's life. One more like that, and I'm going to lose both these men. Cardio-stimulate. Then get me that old portable cardio-stimulator. Call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority. Are you quite through shaking the ship around? I don't mind telling you, you sure make it difficult for a surgeon trying That pig-headed Vulcan stamina. I couldn't have pulled them through without it. Orion? If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here. If you co-operate, you'll be out in two. You are at your station, Mister Spock. Shut up. Shh. Shh! Well, what do you know?

Captain James Kirk. My First Officer, Commander Spock. Thank you. Chief Medical Officer Doctor McCoy. Our pleasure, madam. As soon as you're settled I'll arrange a tour of the ship. Mister Spock will conduct you. As you wish, Ambassador. Mister Spock, we'll leave orbit in two hours. Would you care to beam down and visit your parents? This is the engineering section. There are a number of emergency back-up systems for the main controls. Over here are a number of control computers. Mister Spock. A moment, if you please. Explain the computer components. I'm sorry, Ambassador. I did not mean to offend. I thought that Mrs. Sarek, I just don't understand. Can you? It sounded more like a command. And Spock is his son. Spock is my best officer, and my friend. I take it that Spock disagreed with his father on a choice of career. Starfleet force is used only as a last resort. We're an instrument of civilisation. And it's a better opportunity for a scientist to study the universe than he can get at the Vulcan Science Academy. They are both stubborn. Excuse me. Kirk here. Source? Go to alert status four. Begin long-range scanning. Kirk out. Captain's log, Stardate 3842.4. The interplanetary conference will consider the petition of the Coridan planets to be admitted to the Federation. The Coridan system has been claimed by some of the races now aboard our ship as delegates, races who have strong personal reasons for keeping Coridan out of the Federation. The most pressing problem aboard the Enterprise is to make sure open warfare doesn't break out among the delegates before the conference begins. Ambassador. Gentlemen. Ambassador Sarek is quite correct when he points out this is not the council chamber of Babel. I'm fully aware that the admission of Coridan is a highly debatable issue, but you won't solve it here. Ambassador. Kirk here. On my way. All duty personnel on Yellow Alert. Don't alarm the passengers. Kirk out. Report. Identification, Spock? Does she answer a hail? Care to guess what she is? Mister Chekov, plot course to intercept that vessel. I want to see what she looks like close up. Ready main phasers. Back on original course, Mister Chekov. Report on intruder's movements. Well, we have a shadow. Faster, more manoeuvrable and unidentified. Mister Spock, full analysis of sensor readings. I want to know who that intruder is. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Whatever arguments you have between yourselves is your business. My business is running the ship. As long as I command, there will be order. Kirk here. How was he killed? Explain. Who aboard would have that knowledge? Spock. A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and your father. You're saying he couldn't have done it? But if he had a reason, could he have done it? Mrs. Sarek, I'm sorry to disturb you. I must speak to your husband. Ambassador, the Tellarite. Gav has been murdered. Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour? Then where were you during the hour? That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador. Can you help him? Spock? I'm sorry about your father. Aren't you worried about him? I see. Well, the Romulans have nothing like it. Certainly not the Federation or the neutral planets. What about the Klingons? Who, then? Mister Chekov, directional locator indicates source bearing twenty seven, mark eight. Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant. A personal receiver? Somebody on board is in contact with that vessel? Why not? Are any conclusions possible from the information? Murder? Someone out there playing tag? Lieutenant, you've got your sensor locator on a wide beam. You've established a receiver on board this vessel. Tighten your field to the interior of the ship. If that alien vessel starts transmitting again, I want to know who on board the Enterprise is receiving. Bones, how is he? Ambassador, when did you have these attacks? There were no witnesses? Why? Bones, what about it? There are other Vulcans aboard. Bones. Bridge. Spock. I'm on deck five, near my quarters. I've been attacked by an Andorian. Security. Security team. I'd like to get my hands on the guy with the sledgehammer. No, the one inside my head. How long have I How's Sarek? What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready. I can't damn him for his loyalty, for doing his duty, but I'm not going to let him commit patricide. Bones, Sarek will die without that operation, and you can't operate without transfusions from Spock. I'll convince Spock I'm all right and order him to report here. As soon as he leaves the bridge, I'll turn command over to Scotty and report to my quarters. Will that fill your prescription? I'll take over, Mister Spock. You report to Sickbay with Doctor McCoy. Get out, Spock. Chekov, what's the status of the intruder? Any further transmissions, Lieutenant? Call Mister Scott to the bridge. Belay that order. I'll stay here. Specific origin? Security? Security to the brig. Search the prisoner immediately. Kirk here. Bring the prisoner to the bridge. Deflectors on. Red Alert. Phasers stand by to fire on my order. Chekov, take over Spock's scanners. Target, Mister Chekov. Fire as he passes, Ensign. Report on his weaponry, Mister Chekov. Standard phasers. Good. They may have more speed, but they're not giants. Tell them to take a good guess, but clear that board, Lieutenant. On my order, fire photon torpedoes two, four and six. Widest possible scatter. Fire. Auxiliary power. Your friends out there are good. They'll have to destroy this ship to win. You're not Andorian. Who are you? Damage control procedures, all decks. That ship out there has phasers. At least our weapons are alike. Engineering, this is the Captain. Cut power on port side except for phaser banks. At my signal, cut starboard power. Kirk out. Who are you? You're a spy, surgically altered to pass as an Andorian. Planted in the ambassador's party to use terror and murder to disrupt us and prepare for this attack. Engineering, cut power on starboard side. Maintain until further orders. Chekov. You speculate. No. Stand by your phasers, Mister Chekov. Looking us over. We're dead as far as he knows. Hold your fire, Mister Chekov. Fire. Secure from general quarters. Lieutenant, open the hailing frequency. If they wish to surrender Lieutenant, relay to Starfleet command. Tell them we have a prisoner. Take him to Sickbay. So did they. Mister Chekov, take over. Bones? Spock, Sarek how are they? Bones! Some doctors have all the luck. We damaged their ship. They destroyed themselves to avoid capture. Bones, Thelev's body will be brought to your lab. I want an autopsy performed as soon as possible. But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet? Yes, of course. With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan. You might have had something else on your mind. No, but thank you anyway. Bones. No, no, I'm all right Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this."

I will know where he stands and why. No. You You will excuse me. Vulcan, I would speak to you. How do you vote on the Coridan admission? You favour? Why? That's well for you. Vulcan has no mining interest. Illegal? You accuse us? You call us thieves? Understood. There will be payment for your slander, Sarek."
6551,TOS,episode 39,AMANDA,"Captain Kirk. After all these years among humans, you still haven't learned to smile. And you haven't come to see us in four years, either. Amanda. I'm afraid you couldn't pronounce the Vulcan name. After a fashion, and after many years of practice. Shall we continue the tour? My husband did request it. Of course. He's a Vulcan. I'm his wife. You don't understand the Vulcan way, Captain. It's logical. It's a better way than ours. But it's not easy. It has kept Spock and Sarek from speaking as father and son for eighteen years. I'm glad he has such a friend. It hasn't been easy on Spock. Neither human nor Vulcan. At home nowhere except Starfleet. My husband has nothing against Starfleet. But Vulcans believe that peace should not depend on force. Perhaps. But Sarek wanted Spock to follow his teachings, as Sarek followed the teachings of his own father. A human trait, Captain? Ambassador Gav lost. Well, he, he did have a pet sehlat he was very fond of. It's sort of a fat teddy bear. He's also human. I thought you didn't approve of Starfleet. Sarek, you're proud of him, aren't you? You're showing almost human pride in your son. Not really, but it doesn't matter. I love you anyway. I know. It isn't logical. He's been gone for some time. It's his habit to meditate in private before retiring. What's wrong? Spock? Captain, you're not accusing him? Sarek. Sarek. What's wrong? No. Why didn't you tell me? Please don't. What drug, Doctor? My husband is asleep. What drug? You're going to use it on yourself. A transfusion from you to your father. And I refuse to permit it. I won't risk both of you. Spock, you must turn command over to somebody else. Any competent officer can command this ship. Only you can give your father the blood transfusions that he needs to live. Duty? Your duty is to your father. Well, I don't. It's not human. That's not a dirty word. You're human, too. Let that part of you come through. Your father's dying. If this is what it means, I don't want to know. Nothing is as important as your father's life. When you were five years old and came home stiff-lipped, anguished, because the other boys tormented you saying that you weren't really Vulcan. I watched you, knowing that inside that the human part of you was crying and I cried, too. There must be some part of me in you, some part that I still can reach. If being Vulcan is more important to you, then you'll stand there speaking rules and regulations from Starfleet and Vulcan philosophy, and let your father die. And I'll hate you for the rest of my life. Oh, go to him. Now. Please. Captain, come in. And you, Sarek. Would you also say thank you to your son? For saving your life. Logic, logic! I'm sick to death of logic. Do you want to know how I feel about your logic?"
6552,TOS,episode 39,JOSEPH,"Security to Captain Kirk. Lieutenant Joseph, sir. I'm on deck eleven, section A3. I've just found one of the Tellarites murdered. I think it's the ambassador himself, sir. Security here. We had to stun the Andorian. He had some sort of transceiver. It was hidden in his antenna."
6553,TOS,episode 39,SAREK,"Captain. Your service honours us, Captain. Doctor. My aides and she who is my wife. I'd prefer another guide, Captain. My wife, attend. I gave Spock his first instruction in computers, Captain. He chose to devote his knowledge to Starfleet instead of the Vulcan Science Academy. Offence is a human emotion. I'm returning to my quarters. Continue, my wife. One hundred two point four three seven precisely, Doctor, measured in your years. I had other concerns. The vote will not be taken here, Ambassador Gav. My government's instructions will be heard in the council chambers on Babel. Tellarites do not argue for reasons. They simply argue. You are correct, Captain. Quite logical. We debated during my last council session. Ambassador. Excuse me, Doctor. It has been a rather long day for my wife. Captain. You embarrassed Spock this evening. Not even a mother may do that. He is a Vulcan. He's a Starfleet officer. It is not a question of approval. The fact exists. He is in Starfleet. He must command respect if he is to function. It does not require pride to ask that Spock be given the respect which is his due. Not as my son, but as Spock. Do you understand? It does seem unavoidable. You seem unwilling to wait for the council meeting, Ambassador. No matter. We favour admission. Under Federation law, Coridan can be protected and its wealth administered for the benefit of its people. Coridan has nearly unlimited wealth of dilithium crystals, but it is under-populated and unprotected. This invites illegal mining operations. Some of your ships have been carrying Coridan dilithium crystals. Of course, Captain. Threats are illogical. And payment is usually expensive. You want something of me, Captain? Indeed? Interesting. I quite agree. In private meditation, Captain. Spock will tell you that such meditation is a personal experience, not to be discussed. especially not with Earthmen. Yes. There were three others. My physician prescribed Benjisidrine for the condition. There was nothing you could have done. Two before we left Vulcan, the third a few hours ago. I was on the observation deck. When the Tellarite was murdered, I was quite incapacitated. None. Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart. Yes, unquestionably. My blood type is T-negative. Somewhat rare, even for a Vulcan. Mutual suspicion and interplanetary war. I don't understand. Spock acted in the only logical manner open to him. One does not thank logic, Amanda. She has always been that way. At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do."
6554,TOS,episode 39,THELEV,"That was intended from the beginning, Captain. Find your own answers, Captain. You haven't long to live. Speculation, Captain. What are you doing? You're baiting him. You're trying to lure him in. They could not surrender, Captain. They had orders to self-destruct. Only temporarily, Captain. You see, I had orders to self-destruct, too. Slow poison. Quite painless, actually, but there's no known antidote. I anticipate another ten minutes of life. I seem to have miscalculated."
6555,TOS,episode 39,SHRAS,"Why must you know, Tellarite? My apologies, Captain. Have you met Gav before, Ambassador? He is Thelev, a minor member of my staff. I know nothing of him except that he has served adequately. My people are a violent race, but we've no quarrel with Captain Kirk. You suggest a plot. How could it profit us to harm the captain? Perhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to motivations of passion or gain. Those are reasons for murder."

Since no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably efficient in such matters That would seem a logical conclusion. Yes, Captain, an excellent idea. But a defensible entrance, Captain. The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out. There is enough loose rock and shale. Only a very slight chance it would work. Captain, I didn't say that exactly. The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the weak area of that slide. There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand. Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion. I believe I said that. I would rather, I would rather not. Thank you. That should prove very interesting. The child? Virtue is a relative term, Doctor. She'll head straight to the warriors. Here, Captain. Over here, Captain. Spock to Enterprise. If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I must agree. The Klingon? Revenge, Captain? Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain? Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting.

Only a few months. We found them totally uninterested in medical aid or hospitals. They believe only the strong should survive. Agreed.

But we've discovered a Klingon agent has preceded us to the planet. A discovery which has cost the life of one of my crewmen. Jim! Does Maab know that the Klingons are our sworn enemies by their own words? Yes, I mentioned that. Because he was drawing a weapon on another of their guests. Look, Jim. I know what it means to you to lose a crewman. Yes, Captain? I understand. You've shown friendship by handing over our weapons. She's making a gesture in return. Jim! You touch it, her nearest male relative will have to try to kill you. They're offering you a chance for combat. They consider it more pleasurable than love. Let me take this, Jim. What Maab has said is true. Our customs are different. What the Klingon has said is unimportant, and we do not hear his words. I just called the Klingon a liar. Captain, careful. Captain, I'm going to fix that woman's arm. They can only kill me once for touching her. Let me see that arm. Now listen, you may be a Capellan woman and the widow of a high teer, but I'm a doctor, and it's my tradition to care for the sick and injured. Now, let me see that arm. You listen to me, young woman. I'll touch you in any way or manner that my professional judgment indicates. Just as I thought. It can come anytime now. Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know. Capellans aren't human, Jim. They're humanoid. There's certain internal differences. I don't have equipment to handle an emergency. Forget it. I can do it. The last thing I want around is a ham-handed ship's captain. I'll need help getting her in there. Look, I'm a doctor, not an escalator! Spock, give me a hand! Just a minute. Let me get her on the rock. There you go. No a right cross. It's in mine from now on. Easy, easy. I'm here. Now you must want the child! So they take all the credit here. Poppycock! Answer me. Do you want my help? Answer me. Do you want my help? All right. Say to yourself, The child is mine. The child is mine. It is mine! No, no. You've got it all wrong. No. Say to yourself, The child is mine. It is mine. It is No, no, Mister Spock. You place this arm under here to support its back, and this hand here to support its head. I'll explain later. Jim! Spock! Jim! Spock! My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone. It's all right. It's in there. I guess I'll forget psychiatry, stick with surgery. I really thought she'd learned to want it. I'll go with you. No, that's not the way to handle it. Here, like this. Here, take his little head like that. There, arm in a. That's it. See how easy? Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.

6583,TOS,episode 40,SCOTT,"How long were you stationed on the planet, Doctor? Aye, sir. We'll keep on our toes. Well, let's put it on the screen. Who else would be playing cat and mouse with a starship? Well, they can't hurt us much out there, bobbing about like that. No need to call the captain yet. Put a booster on it, Lieutenant. Try to pull it in. Dierdre? That's a freighter. Helm? Try the captain. Prepare to take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. We have a distress call from a Federation ship under attack. That's where our duty lies. Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Ahead warp five. Captain's log, stardate 3498.9. Lieutenant Commander Scott in temporary command. We were forced to leave Capella to aid a Federation vessel under attack by a Klingon vessel. We were unable to contact our landing party before we were forced to answer the distress signal. Our inability to reach the landing party is strange and I am concerned. Sensor report, Mister Chekov. Mister Sulu, begin a standard search pattern. All scanners full intensity, Mister Chekov. No signal at all? I'm well aware of a freighter's maximum speed, Mister Sulu. Captain's log, stardate 3499.1. Before leaving the Capellan encampment, we managed to retrieve our communicators. Our phasers were not to be found. We've fled into the hills, yet we know the Capellans will eventually find us by scent alone, if necessary. And we've learned one thing more. The girl, Eleen, hates the unborn child she is carrying. A vessel doesn't just disappear. Mister Chekov? Mister Chekov, pull the microtape on that distress call. I want it replayed. Did you hear it? They called us by name. Not a general distress signal, but one aimed right at us. How would a freighter know we were ordered into this sector? We'll stay long enough to make certain. Continue search pattern. Mister Chekov? We're turning back. Warp five, Helm. Warp 6 as soon as she'll take it, Mister Sulu. The captain could be in trouble back there. Ignore it. Ignore it, Lieutenant. Log it as my order, my responsibility. There's an old, old saying on Earth, Mister Sulu. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Estimating to planet? Sub-light one half. Mister Sulu, sound battle stations. Drawing a line, daring us to step over it. This is the commander of the Enterprise. Identify yourself and your intention. Acknowledge. Close out the frequency, Lieutenant. And we'll go right down their throat, if necessary. Let's see if they have the belly for it. Hold it there. Drop your weapons. Well sir, we had a wee bit of a run-in with a Klingon vessel, but he had no stomach for fighting. We checked the encampment, found out you were here, and had no trouble at all in tracking you down. I could What's that again, Mister Spock?"
6584,TOS,episode 40,KIRK,"Yes, Mister Sulu. Report. Very good. Have the transporter room stand by. Analysis, gentlemen. Yes, but in this case, with the more people we take down, the greater chance we have of violating one of their taboos. Very well. Scotty, you're in command. Bear in mind that the Klingons have been sighted in this sector. While we're negotiating down there, we don't want the Enterprise to become an incident up here. I'm Captain Kirk. Grant, no! He was young, and inexperienced. Let me call my ship and inform them So they keep their word scrupulously. They're unusually honest. Is that what I heard you say, Doctor? Dangerous if lied to, if their customs are violated. We lied to no one, Doctor. We violated no customs. Perhaps you'll explain to me why one of my men is dead. Grant looked up, saw a Klingon, made a purely instinctive defensive move. What's a Klingon doing down here among your scrupulously honest friends anyway? That's only one down, Doctor. There's over four hundred more up there in orbit. And if there's a Klingon down here, there might be a Klingon ship up there somewhere. Bones. I shouldn't have chewed you out. I'm sorry. Yes, you're quite right, Mister Spock. Inefficient and illogical. I'm Captain Kirk. First of all, I must protest the killing of my crewman. The Earth Federation offers one other thing, Akaar. Our laws. And the highest of all our laws states that your world is yours and will always remain yours. This differs us from the Klingons. Their empire is made up of conquered worlds. They take what they want by arms and force. We need our communicators, those devices on our belts. If there's a Klingon ship somewhere Klingon! Communicators, weapons. Type of vessel. Location. Wait. If you lead these people now, be certain you make the right decisions. Or let the Klingon and me fight. It might amuse you. I must assume that something's keeping them busy up there. The Klingon ship. That's a very good idea, Bones. You said you're prepared to die. Does that mean you'd prefer to die? I think we can get you safely to the ship. Your choice. Bones. All right. Let's go. Stay with her, Bones. Nice place to get trapped in. Yes, I see. Scout up the trail that way. See what we have in the way of an exit. I'll take a look around. Good. If we could block off that entrance, hold them off, it'd give us more time. They'd have to go around these hills. Do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of our communicators? Well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try. Worried about the delivery? Well, if you don't think you can handle it There's a cave in there. Probably the only shelter around here. Bones, you've got one of those magnesite-nitron tablets in your kit. Give me one. How did you arrange to touch her, Bones, give her a happy pill? Never seen that in a medical book. Vegetation, Captain. Evidently there's water nearby. Good, but we need weapons just as much as we need water, Spock. Follow me. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. You mean it makes a good bowstring. That's more like it. Since the Capellans never developed the bow, this may come as big a surprise as gunpowder was on Earth. Our child? What happened, Bones? Bones, you took a medical oath long before you signed aboard my ship. That small patient in there needs you. Spock. Spock! The cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time anymore. There's just one thing I want. One of us must get him. Why not? Klingon! We missed you, Mister Scott. An obscure Earth dialect, Mister Spock. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. If you're curious, consult linguistics. Interesting? We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott. Contact Starfleet. Inform them the Federation mining rights on Capella have been secured by treaty, documents signed by the young high chief's regent. Report follows. Yes, Eleen. Remarkable young lady. Yes. I think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history, Leonard. What do you think, Spock? Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Ahead warp factor one. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

It is as I told you, Maab. Earthmen fear to bargain honestly. And different from those of my people, too, Teer. The sight of death frightens them. What do Earth men offer you? What have you obtained from them in the past? Powders and liquids for the sick? We Klingons believe as you do. The sick should die. Only the strong should live. Earthmen have promised to teach the youth of your tribes many things. What? What things? Cleverness against enemies? The use of weapons? I have no quarrel with you, Captain. I wish merely to return to my vessel. A small scout ship, Captain. We need the mineral, too. I was sent to negotiate. Kill them now. Is the new leader of the Ten Tribes afraid? Let me kill him for you. We had an agreement. She was prepared to die, Earthman. We made an agreement, Maab. I have a right to my weapons. They must die. That is your law. If true, take us to them. First, we'll verify her story. The next man who raises a weapon destroys all of you. You and your primitive knives and your weapons, I'll teach you what killing really means."

You will not touch me. To live is always desirable. You will not touch me in that manner. How do you know? Even the women of our village cannot tell so much with a touch. Strange hand. Very soft. No!

If it was your man, wasn't it his privilege to die for you? I do not understand. It was the Earth people who first bargained for our rocks. It is I who speak for the tribe, Maab. The Earth men have different customs, but never have they lied to our people. Do you say you will fight me, Maab? The sky does not interest me. I must consider the words I have heard."

Will you do the same? Will you hand us your weapons? Their customs are different, Teer. Laughter, Teer? Is not the Klingon an honoured guest also? Is it not best to have two who bargain for the same goods? I speak for many, Teer. Hear the words of the Klingon. Good, good. Let the Klingons and the Earthmen offer us amusement. Capellans welcome this. There are those of us who won't bargain with Earthmen, Akaar. Let that be your choice, Teer. Release him. Akaar is dead. I am the teer. Perhaps to be a teer is to see in new ways. I begin to like you, Earthman, and I saw fear in the Klingon's eye. That too may change, Klingon. You carry a child who would be teer. No man may touch the wife of a teer. Klingon. There's nothing to concern you there. We have them well cared for, Klingon. Your weapon will be returned when our business is completed. That was our agreement. The Earthmen make excellent game. Their cleverness has surprised me. We will honour our law, and our word to you, Klingon. It is in order. She is the wife of a teer. No! Is this what your sworn word means, Klingon? Naam. As teer of the Ten Tribes, I give you back your life. Mine is now forfeit. Keel, stand ready. Klingon!"

I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and normal mass. I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary. We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The comet was a rogue and has never been investigated. All research lines negative, Captain. I'm doing that, Captain, as per your previous order. We discussed that earlier. Acknowledged. Based on what Doctor McCoy gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time. Yes, Captain. In a very short time. I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold. Captain, you sent such a message this morning. Captain, I believe Captain. Captain. Yes, sir. Quite understandable. Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction. The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly through the comet's trail. On conventional radiation settings, we discovered nothing. On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale, undetected radiation appeared. Below normal radiation levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet. Quadrant four four eight, sir. Mister Sulu, what is our present position? Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before. I have a question for the doctor. Doctor, the ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me. I've adjusted the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees, which is at least tolerable. However, I I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold. Yes. As I always suspected. Commodore? I am aware of that. For what, sir? On what grounds, Commodore? Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same affliction? I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command. Sir, I do have duties to perform. I resist that suggestion, Commodore. Very well, sir. The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred hours. Let it read that this competency hearing was ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself. On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk, would you like to make a statement? It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite specific. You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them. Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk? To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making decisions? Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra Four? Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order? Did he order you to increase orbit? Did he not several minutes later repeat that order? Mister Sulu, please answer the question. Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and signed. Is that correct? Yeoman, you will simply answer the question. You guess? Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have broken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom? And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours? Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed Gamma Hydra Four? Using Code two. After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two. Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy! Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a complete physical examination of Captain Kirk. Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using established norms as comparative base. Doctor McCoy. Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's present physical condition. Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly? Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's physical age. Do you agree with it? Do you agree with it, Doctor? This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore Stocker, have something that you would like to add. Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk? Captain, I would suggest Gamma Hydra Four, Captain. You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions. We have no more questions, Captain. There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the room so the board can vote Sir, you have never commanded a starship. The danger from the Romulans Yes, Captain. I'm sorry, Captain. Regulations require Captain, I have not assumed command. I suffer the same affliction as you, sir. Commodore Stocker. Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking officer I cannot, Captain. No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard this ship. It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use. No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments. Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed. Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this serum. It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements. It could cure or kill, Doctor. Doctor Wallace, give him the shot. Romulans giving ground, Captain. Obviously, they tapped in as you expected them to. Yes, sir. The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling behind. I am quite ready now, Doctor. That is very considerate of you, Doctor."

Aye, sir. They are. Those of Captain Kirk. He did. Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code three. Yes. I think we just made contact, sir. Engineering wants instructions, sir. I'm trying, Commodore.

6858,TOS,episode 41,MCCOY,"Perhaps they weren't expecting us. Did he report anything wrong? Exactly what it looks like. Death by natural causes. Old age. He can hear you, Jim, but he doesn't understand. Let's let him rest. The expedition is suffering from extreme old age, and they're growing older by the minute. Much older. My examinations have turned up absolutely nothing. In fact, I don't have a clue. Lieutenant Galway. Of course. Go right ahead. It's probably nothing important. Well, don't worry about it. Perhaps a little hypersonic treatment might clear it up. The last one. Robert Johnson. Cause of death, old age. Which adds up to absolutely nothing. All you need are vitamins, but you can come up anyhow. You take over my job and see what happens to you. What's your problem, Jim? You're probably right, Doctor. By the way, I don't like how you've been running this ship lately. Jim, I think we better'd run a complete physical on you. No, Jim. It's advanced arthritis, and it's spreading. I can run it through again, but I'll come up with the same thing.   All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of Chekov, are aging at various rates. Approximately thirty years for each day. I don't know what's causing it. A virus, a bacteria, or evil spirits, but I'm trying to find out. I'm doing what I can. You're perfectly healthy. I did not say you weren't affected, Mister Spock. You are perfectly healthy, that is, for any normal Vulcan on the high side of a hundred. You can leave, too, Lieutenant Galway. Lieutenant Galway? Yes, I spoke to you. I said that you could leave, too. Now why don't you go down to your quarters and get some sleep. People age normally at different speeds, Jim. I don't know. His genes. All right, nurse. Prepare Chekov for another complete physical. Then try that, Doctor Wallace. Try anything, but do it quickly. Radiation? That's as good an answer as any, but why didn't we know about it earlier? Run this through, Doctor. Well, I see I'm not going to be making any house calls on you. I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor. Well, then we just start over, that's all. We work harder, faster, and we start completely from scratch if we have to. But we find something. Now this isn't going to hurt a bit. Did it hurt? She's dead. Her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than the rest of us, but the same thing's going to happen to us unless Oh, a matter of days. Perhaps hours. Yes, Spock? What is it? I did. Yes. Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging. Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine. Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Yes, yes. Now that could be. Right. Scared. Heart beats faster, breathe gets short, and there's cold sweats and adrenaline flows. Adrenal activity. Now hold on Just a minute. There was something that I read once. It was ancient history, just after the atomic age. Used for radiation sickness. Adrenaline. Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early research, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered. Don't just stand there jawing, Spock. You and Doctor Wallace get cracking. No, Jim. You can't do it. Nurse? Doctor Wallace! Nurse.  Jim-boy, you just lay quiet. You can't do no good. We're both through. All right. Let's, let's go. Don't give me any Vulcan details. Just give me the shot. You can't. Well, well, what's happening? Feeling fine. So is Scotty. The serum worked. He pulled a muscle during the reaction, but otherwise he's feeling fine. Oh, very well. A few bruises here and there. Oh. Anytime you're ready, Mister Spock. Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely potent shot for you. However, you might like to know I've removed all the breakables from Sickbay. I thought you'd be pleased to hear that."

Orbiting at twenty thousand, sir. Maintaining, sir. Two years, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Captain Kirk repeated his order. Across the Neutral Zone? Entering Romulan Neutral Zone, sir. All sensors on maximum. Romulans approaching from both sides. We're bracketed, sir. Lieutenant Uhura is right, sir. We've tangled with them before. Sir, they've fired another. They know they have us. They know our shields will give out. We're losing power, sir. We're surrounded by Romulan vessels. Maximum of ten.

6864,TOS,episode 41,KIRK,"Where is everyone? I had a subspace contact with a Robert Johnson, the leader of this expedition, an hour ago. No, yet there was something wrong. I can't pin it down. His conversation was disjointed, his thoughts a little foggy, unrelated. Chekov, check that building. Mister Spock and I will check this one. The rest of you, take a look around. See if you can find anyone. What is it? Well? I'm Captain Kirk of I say I'm Captain Kirk of the Enterprise. Who are you? How old are you? How old are you? Mister Johnson, can you hear me? Can you tell me what happened? Did your instruments show anything? If they seem lucid, I'll be in the briefing room. Stay seated. Commodore Stocker, I've asked you to be part of this briefing because Gamma Hydra Four falls in your administrative area. Doctor Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you working very closely Doctor McCoy. Doctor McCoy, would you fill them in? What about the atmosphere and environment, Mister Spock? We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the Romulan empire. It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs. Good. I want you all to check out everything in your own departments. No matter how remote, how far-fetched the notion, I want it run down. We'll stay in orbit until we have the answer. Yes, Commodore. We'll do everything we can to make sure you make your duty. Doctor, is there something I can do for you? How long has it been? Well, it's been a long time. Things wouldn't change if it started all over again, would it? You have your job, I have my ship, and neither one of us will change. Well, I supposed that you met someone you loved. And in your field as you. You didn't give up a thing. I'm on my way. Maintain. What about the comet that astrophysics reported? Yes, Commodore. Thank you. You're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few facilities of our own here. I think the Enterprise will do quite nicely. I'll be in engineering, Mister Spock. Maintain standard orbit, Mister Sulu. Oh? Well, follow it. Progress report, Mister Spock. Astronomical section reports that a comet recently passed by. Check into that. Oh, yes. Let me know what you come up with. I'll be in the Sickbay. You did what you could. Bones, I believe you're getting grey. I see what you mean. Shoulder. Just a twinge. Probably muscular strain. All right. Reprimand received. Go ahead. Why? Just muscular strain, isn't it? That's impossible. Scotty! Captain's log, stardate 3579.4. The Enterprise personnel who beamed down to the planet's surface, Doctor McCoy, Engineer Scott, Mister Spock, Lieutenant Galway, and myself are all showing definite signs of aging. Only Ensign Chekov appears to be normal. Report, Bones. Spock, could I ask for some figures? Total senility? What a way to die. All right. I want all the research facilities, all the scientific technicians, to start round-the-clock research immediately. I want the answers, and I want the remedy. Let's start by finding out why Chekov hasn't been affected. You feel up to it? Lieutenant Galway, assume your position. Start your duties. She's ten years younger than I am, and she looks, Why hasn't he aged? Well I want to know! Is it his youth, his blood type, his heritage, his glands, his genes? I'll be on the Bridge. Keep me posted as to Chekov. I thought you were on your way to the biochemistry lab, Doctor. So we do. You sound like my first officer. That didn't spring from logic. When did you realise that? Today? How much older was your husband than you? Answer me. That's quite a difference. Look at me. Look at me. What do you see? And old. And rapidly growing older. What are you offering me, Jan? Love, or a going away present? Increase orbit to twenty thousand perigee, Mister Sulu. Yeoman. You have a reason for being on the Bridge, Commodore Stocker? I have very little time. We're going to be late. I don't intend to leave this area until we've found the solution for this problem. Yes, yes. If you're so concerned, I'll send a message to Starbase Ten. Yeoman? Where's that Fuel consumption report? If I'd signed it, I wouldn't have asked for it, now would l? Mister Spock. I was just thinking. You have something to report? What is it? Good, Spock. Well done. Let's get this to Doctor McCoy immediately. Oh. Lieutenant, take a message to Starfleet Command. Due to the proximity of the Romulans, you'd better use Code two. Then use Code three. Message. Key to affliction may be comet which passed by Gamma Hydra Four. Said comet is now, Quadrant. All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of radiation and means found to neutralise it. Comet is highly dangerous. Kirk, commanding Enterprise. Immediately, Lieutenant. Let's go. Oh, Mister Sulu. Increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee. I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being questioned. Now do as you're told, Mister Sulu. Maintain. All right, Bones, I'm going up to the Bridge. Keep me posted. Spock? Bones. How long have we got, Bones? Let it also read that I consider it invalid. Yes, I would like to make a statement. I am the captain of this ship and am totally capable of commanding her. Let's call this whole thing off and get back to work. Very kind of you, Spock. He did not. When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. I don't have to repeat myself. No, I'm thirty four. I'm thirty four years old. I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mister Spock. No, no, no. It's all right, Spock. It's all right. There's only one reason, and one reason alone, for having this, hearing. I refused to leave Gamma Hydra Two Yes. A slip of the tongue. So I'm a little confused. Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill. And this nonsense about a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man. Trying to relieve a captain of his command is, well, that's, that's. Spock, I wouldn't have believed it of you. Go ahead. Ask me questions. I'll show you what I'm capable of. There's nothing wrong with my memory. Go ahead! Ask me anything! We're in orbit around Gamma Hydra Two, right? Anyhow, it doesn't matter. There's a lot more to running a starship than answering a lot of fool questions. A lot more. Go ahead. Ask me questions. Ask me anything. Anything. Good idea. Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to running the ship. The most fool thing I ever heard of. Competency hearing when there's work to be done. I'll be in my quarters, awaiting your decision. Spock? So, I've been relieved. Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney. Regulations. Don't give me regulations. You've wanted command all along. First little excuse you get I hope you're proud of. What do you mean, you've not assumed command? If you're not in command, who is? Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command. No! Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound paper-pusher. I order you to take command. Are you refusing a direct order? You traitorous, disloyal, you stab me in the back the first chance you get? Spock. Get out. I never want to have to look at you again. Jan, Jan. I made a fool of myself in there. I shouldn't have let them confuse me, rattle me. But I'm not old, Jan. I'm not. A few muscular aches doesn't make a man old. And you don't run a starship with your arms. You run it with your head. My brain's as sharp as it ever was. A simple case of radiation poisoning, and they relieve me of my command. I admit I'm getting a little grey, but radiation will do that to you. Jan, you know me. Look at me closely. Tell me. Am I getting old? What are you doing here? Maybe you'd like to relieve Doctor McCoy. What about Chekov? Bones, there has to be. There has to be. We beamed down together. We were on the surface together. The same spot. We were together all the time. He left us? He left us. He went into the building. Spock, something happened. He was scared! He saw the dead body and he ran out of the building and he was scared to death. I'm going up to the bridge. I have to go to the bridge. We're under attack. Let me go. We're under attack. I have to go to the Bridge. I've got to go to the bridge. Greenhorn, up there ruining my ship. No. No. My ship. My ship. No. I'll take the first shot. How long do you think this ship can take the pounding? I've got to get up there. I'll die anyway. Do it. Quickly. Quickly. Report, Mister Sulu. Engineering, this is the captain. I want full emergency power. I want everything within about two minutes. I want the warp drive engines on full standby. Kirk out. Open up a special channel to Starfleet Command. Code two. That's an order, Lieutenant. Code two. Message. From Enterprise to Starfleet Command this sector. Have inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone. Surrounded and under heavy Romulan attack. Escape impossible, shields failing. Will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed. Since this will result in the destruction of the Enterprise and all matter in a two hundred thousand kilometre diameter and establish a corresponding dead zone, all Federation ships will avoid this area for the next four solar years. Explosion will take place in one minute. Kirk, commanding Enterprise, out. Mister Sulu, course one eight eight degrees, mark fourteen. Speed, warp factor eight. Stand by. A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are they still retreating? Good. All hands, stand by. Warp factor eight, now. Are we out of range, Mister Sulu? Secure from Red Alert. Adjust a new course, two five seven degrees, mark three. Heading for Starbase Ten. Noted. You should know, however, that there's very little a Starbase can do that a starship can't. You're looking good, Doc. And yourself? Well, gentlemen, all and all, an experience we'll remember in our old age. Which won't be for some while, I hope. Take over, Mister Sulu. Steady as she goes. I thought I said that. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Of the six members of the colony, none of whom were over thirty, we found four had died and two were dying of old age."
7117,TOS,episode 41,GALWAY,"Doctor, may I speak to you for a moment, please? I know this is going to sound foolish, but I seem to be having a little trouble hearing. I never had trouble before. Thank you. What? You spoke to me, Doctor? No. I don't want to sleep. Can't you understand? If I sleep, what will I find when I wake up? Thank you, sir. What a stupid place to hang a mirror. Doctor."
7118,TOS,episode 41,STOCKER,"I appreciate that, sir. I'm sure you understand that I'm anxious to get to Starbase Ten to assume my new post. Thank you, sir. Captain Kirk? Facilities at Starbase Ten are much more complete than those on board ship. It seems to me that your investigations would be facilitated if we proceeded there. I assure you all co-operation. I'd hoped for a few words with you at your convenience. If I may say so sir, we have a due date at Starbase Ten. Captain, I'm watching four very valuable and one almost irreplaceable members of the Starfleet failing before my eyes. I want to do something to help. Spock, can I have a word with you? Mister Spock, a starship can function with a Chief Engineer, a Chief Medical Officer, even a First Officer under physical par. But it's disastrous to have a commanding officer whose condition is any less than perfection. Please understand me. My admiration for Captain Kirk is unbounded. He is a great officer. But Mister Spock, I need your help and your co-operation. I would like you to take over command of the Enterprise. On the grounds that the captain, because of his affliction, is unable to perform his duties. Yes, but you're a Vulcan. You have a much greater life span. You show the affects to a much smaller degree. Well, if you are not, with your Vulcan physique, then obviously Captain Kirk cannot be. Mister Spock. I do not like what I'm about to say but regulations demand it. And as a Starfleet flag officer, I must follow regulations. As second in command of the Enterprise, you must convene an extraordinary competency hearing. It's not a matter of choice. When a captain is unfit, physically or mentally, a competency hearing is mandatory. Please don't make me quote a regulation which you know as well as I do. Mister Spock, may I make a statement? I have had to resort to these legal grounds in order to save the lives of some very valuable members of the Starfleet. I have tried to convince Captain Kirk of the necessity of proceeding to Starbase Ten, but I've been overruled in each case. The responsibility of this hearing is mine. The computer differs with you, Captain. No. I am quite satisfied, Mister Spock. Well, since the senior officers are incapable and I am of flag rank, I am forced by regulations to assume command. What would you have, a junior officer with far less experience than I have? Mister Spock, we have to save these people. Mister Sulu, set a direct course for Starbase Ten. Warp five. Immediately, Mister Sulu. All officers are to return to their posts. Thank you, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, let me know if we contact any Romulan. Keep trying to raise the Romulans. If I could talk to them, explain to them why we violated the Neutral Zone. Opinion, Mister Sulu. Well then, we have no alternative but to surrender. What am I going to do? I've got to do something. Captain, I just wanted to assure you that I did what I thought best to save you and the men. If I may say so, Captain, I am now quite aware of what a starship can do with the right man at the helm."
7119,TOS,episode 41,WALLACE,"Yes, Captain. Well, be a little less the cool, efficient Captain and a little more the old friend. Six years, four months, and an odd number of days. You mean you don't know? You said it. I didn't. In all those years, I only heard from you once. A stargram when my husband died. You know, you never asked me why I got married after we called it off. I met a man I admired. A great man. No. Just you. A few years ago on Aldebaran Three, my husband and I tried various carbohydrate compounds to slow down the degeneration of plant life. Yes, sir. We both go in the same direction. Look, we know the problem. We know the progress of the affliction. Therefore, once we find the proper line of research, it's only logical we find the solution. No problem is insoluble. Not even ours. Our situation doesn't have its roots in logic. The heart is not a logical organ. When I married Theodore Wallace, I thought I was over you. I was wrong. What? What difference does that make? Twenty six years. Jim, he was a brilliant man. We were stationed on a lonely outpost. We were working together. I don't want to talk about him. I want to talk about us. I see Captain James Kirk, a man of morality, decency, handsome, and strong. Jim, please. Doctor McCoy, none of our usual radiation therapies will have any effect on this radiation sickness. Oh, Jim. I'm sorry. Truly I am. Everybody understood. Oh, Jim, will you forgive me? I have work to do. Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation sickness. Jim. Jim, if I have to give you a shot Jim, it could kill you. The ageing process has stopped. His bodily functions are getting stronger."
7120,TOS,episode 41,ATKINS,"Will you sign this, sir? Sir? I gave it to you. You signed it. Your signature, Captain. Sir, he had more important things on his mind. I, I guess he forgot he'd signed it. He'd forgot he'd signed it."

I'll phaser off a specimen. We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet. There are doubtless many pollen aromas. Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments. Rizzo's alive, barely. You think you know what it was, Captain? Spock here. Ready to leave orbit, Captain. Spock again, Captain. Those medical supplies are badly needed on planet Theta Seven. They are expecting us to get them there on time. Continuing scanning. Still no readings of life forms on the planet. You mentioned dikironium, Captain. I've scanned for that element, Captain. There's no trace of dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere. To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change its molecular structure, like gold changing itself to lead or wood changing itself to ivory. Chekov, take over on scanner. What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign? Composition? Captain, scientifically I hope I'm not disturbing you, Doctor. I need your advice. I do not understand your reasoning. I do not joke, Doctor. Perhaps I should rephrase my statement. I require an opinion. There are many aspects of human irrationality I do not yet comprehend. obsession, for one. The persistent, single-minded fixation on one idea. Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the Farragut? Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated. The captain's name was Garrovick. His father. Among the survivors was a young officer on his first deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk. And there is still more. I suggest you study this. Correctly phrased, Captain. As recommended in the manual. Our reply, also as recommended, is, sir, we have noted in your recent behaviour certain items, which, on the surface, seem unusual. We respectfully ask permission to inquire further Sir, the Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point. It carries perishable drugs Creature, Captain? You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it communicate with you? Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel, it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets. We are barely closing in on it, Captain. We could be pursuing it for days. Conflicting data, Captain. It seems to be in a borderline state between matter and energy. Elements of both. It could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion. Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates intelligence is another matter. The deflectors will not stop it, Captain. I should have surmised this. For the creature to be able to use gravity as a propulsive force, it would have to have this capacity. May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature. The matter has now been rendered academic. The creature is now after us. It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered and intelligent. Impossible to tell, Captain, until I can make a closer survey of the creature. Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago, it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact, there was no fault. Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed by what you consider to be a failure on your part? I would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is an hereditary trait of your species. When suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger, the human will experience a split second of indecision. He hesitates. Do I have your attention, Ensign? I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe we have enough of that. I simply would like you to accept the fact that your reaction has its basis in physio. Do you smell something? Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off. Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign. The reverse pressure worked. The vent is closed. My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron. Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct. Do you believe you're in communication with the creature? It was bearing one two seven mark nine, but I've lost it now. It has changed course before to mislead us, Captain. Logic would dictate that I do not understand, Captain. And you know where home is, Captain? Precisely. Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so, it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands. An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum field. There is still one problem, Captain. Exactly. A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the planet's atmosphere. If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under those conditions. If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose him. Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the creature could not harm me extensively. It therefore seems logical for me to be the one It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit. Spock here, Captain. Acknowledged. Spock here, Captain. Holding at thirty thousand kilometres. Spock here. Reset. Energise. We are, Doctor. Cross-circuiting to A. Cross-circuiting to B. Mister Scott, there was no deity involved. It was my cross-circuiting to B that recovered them."

There wasn't a red corpuscle left in their bodies. Not a one. What happened is medically impossible. Thank you, Captain. I'll check those tapes immediately. Yes, but it In his present condition, I don't think it would make much difference. Give him one cc of cordazine, nurse. He's beginning to sleep again. I can't risk another shot. I wouldn't depend too much what he says in that half-conscious state. He could be dreaming, saying what he thought you wanted to hear. I intend to find out. I'll be in the medical record library. Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud? Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a creature. A living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of chemical elements? You were a little hard on the boy, Jim. Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Mister Spock. It's a relief. Then I need a drink. You need advice from me? You must be kidding. Jim and his creature? No. With all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance to scan the tapes. There are eight or ten hours of record tape there. The same as our Ensign. Mind if I come in? Sometimes they do, if we're lucky. Monsters come in many forms. You know the greatest monster of them all, Jim? Guilt. Jim, When a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the first time, he's under tremendous emotional stress. Now we all know that. Am I? I was speaking of Lieutenant James T. Kirk of the starship Farragut. Eleven years ago, you were the young officer at the phaser station when something attacked. According to the tapes, this young Lieutenant Kirk insisted upon blaming himself. You had a normal emotion. You were startled. You delayed firing for a grand total of perhaps two seconds. The ship's exec didn't seem to think so. His log entry was quite clear on the subject. Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery. Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim? You don't know that, Jim. You don't know that any more than you know that Garrovick could have destroyed it. To be so obsessed. That you could destroy yourself, your career, a young boy who reminds you of yourself eleven years ago. I'm not, Jim. This is professional, Captain. I am preparing a medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of a starship captain. Which requires a witness of command grade. They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain. Now why are we delaying here? You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness. A semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing. A man never knows how much is real or how much is imagination. Yes, there's no doubt about that. Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you. At this point, my medical log remains open. What's that? A survey on Cygnian Respiratory Diseases? I thought you took Garrovick some food. What were you doing with this? One man has a chance for survival. The other is dead. You can add that little price tag to your monster hunt. It's not enough! You didn't care as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall. Well, it's not on it, Captain, it's in it. Creature, Mister Spock? I'm sorry, Jim. I was wrong. Jim, Spock may be dying. It's that green blood of his. I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too. I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it. It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are perishable. I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the creature? Do something. Crazy way to travel, spreading a man's molecules all over the universe. Well then, thank pitchforks and pointed ears. As long as it worked, Jim."

The Yorktown is expecting to rendezvous with us in less than seven hours.

The medicine for Theta Seven colony is not only needed desperately and has limited Agreed, sir. Captain, we can't maintain warp eight speed much longer. Pressures are approaching the critical point.

A thing with a an odour like that. Rizzo. Take your men. Make a swing around our perimeter. Scan for dikironium in the atmosphere. Set your phasers on disrupter-B. If you see any gaseous cloud, fire immediately. You're on Red Alert. Make a sweep. Negative, Scotty. We're checking something out. Acknowledged. Continue standing by. Kirk out. It's gone.

Then you'll inform them that we might be a little late. Gentlemen, we are remaining in orbit until I find out more about those deaths, on my responsibility. I am perfectly aware that it might cost lives on Theta Seven. Kirk out. Autopsy report. Marks, cuts, incisions of any kind? I suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar occurrences. You'll find the Farragut lists casualties eleven years ago from exactly the same impossible causes. First, can you bring Ensign Rizzo to consciousness for a moment? Will it hurt him if you do so? Then do so. Rizzo. This is the captain. Can you hear me? Do you remember what happened to you? You were attacked by something. When it happened, did you notice an odour of any kind? Rizzo. Rizzo! Do you remember a sickly sweet odour? Did you smell it? Did you feel a presence, an intelligence? He's already told me what I wanted to know. You check those record tapes. I want your medical analysis as quickly as possible. Not now. Have the security duty officer report to me immediately. Spock? Let's assume that it's something so completely different that our sensors wouldn't identify it as a life form. Suppose it was composed of that rare element. A strange, gaseous creature. Suppose it camouflaged itself. Let's assume that it's intelligent, that it knows we're looking for it. You've just suggested something that never occurred to me. It may provide some answers to a tape record which I think you'll find Doctor McCoy is looking at this very moment. Are you the new security officer? Was your father You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister. You knew Rizzo? You'll get a crack at what killed him. Interested? I want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect. Join me in the transporter room in five minutes. You'll accompany me to the planet surface. Spock was right. Notice the molecular shift?  Over that rise. Take two men, circle around to the left. I'll take the other two and go the other way. That creature is dangerous. If you see it, fire full phasers. Swensen, Bardoli come with me. A phaser! Come on! Garrovick, did you? Captain's log, stardate 3619.6. One of the men in critical condition, the other is dead. And I, I am now even more convinced that this is not only an intelligent creature, but the same which decimated the crew of the Farragut eleven years ago in another part of the galaxy. Both Spock and McCoy are doubtful of this, and I sense they also doubt my decision to stay and fight the thing. Why am I keeping the ship here? Mister Garrovick, we've studied your report. Mister Spock, begin. But you didn't come to actual contact with it, did you? Did you say it hovered? You did fire at it, didn't you? What distance were you from the creature? You fired at a large, hovering target at that distance and missed? You mean you froze? What exactly were you doing? Do you have any further information? Do you gentlemen have any further questions? Ensign, you're relieved of all duties and confined to quarters until further notice. He froze. One man was killed. Another may die. You'll both be filing reports. Make your comments and recommendations then. We're not leaving orbit, Mister Scott. Not that quickly. Thank you. I'm aware of the situation, Engineer, and I'm getting a little tired of my senior officers conspiring against me. Forgive me. Perhaps I shouldn't have used the word conspire. Scanner readings? Are you aware it can change its molecular structure? Are you scanning for any unusual movement? Any type of gaseous cloud? Then run it twenty times if that's what it takes! Personal log, stardate 3620.7. Have I the right to jeopardise my crew, my ship for a feeling I can't even put into words? No man achieves Starfleet command without relying on intuition, but have I made a rational decision? Am I letting the horrors of the past distort my judgment of the present? Kirk to bridge. Scanning report. Maintain search. Kirk out. It can't have just vanished. Get to the point. Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision. You're straying out of your field, Doctor. Because I delayed in firing at it. If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed. Don't you understand? It killed two hundred crewmen. Yes. He was my commanding officer from the day I left the Academy. One of the finest men I ever knew. I could have killed that thing if I'd fired soon enough the first time. I can't help how I feel. There's an intelligence about it, Bones. A malevolence. It's evil. It must be destroyed. Obsessed? Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take official Do I take it, Doctor, Commander, that both of you or either of you consider me unfit or incapacitated? Blast it! Forget the manual! Ask your questions. Skip the recitation, Spock. I know the facts. Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that attacked the Farragut eleven years ago. My report is on the tapes. As it attacked us eleven years ago, as I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing. I could sense it thinking, planning. Whatever it is, Doctor, whatever it is, wouldn't you call it deadly? And what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years ago from a planet over a thousand light years from here? A lot of ifs, I agree, but in my command judgment, they out weigh other factors. Intuition, however illogical, Mister Spock, is recognized as a command prerogative. And you haven't, Doctor. You've expressed the proper concern, you've asked the proper questions. You've both done your duty. Now may I ask what medical log entry you intend to make? In that case, gentlemen Kirk here. All decks, Red Alert. Red alert. Prepare to leave orbit. Range, Mister Chekov? If necessary. Do what you can to increase our speed, Scott. Extreme magnification, Mister Chekov. Spock, how do you read that? And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock? We won't be using the impulse engines. Turn the alarm off. Go to warp six. Reduce speed. Approach slowly. Maybe it's decided to fight. Phasers ready? Battle stations. All decks to battle stations. This is not a drill. All decks to battle stations. Move in closely, Mister Chekov. Sublight one quarter speed. Lock all phasers on target. Fire phasers, Mister Chekov. Photon torpedoes. Minimum spread pattern. Fire photon torpedoes. Deflectors up. Lieutenant Uhura, all decks Negative pressure in all ship's vents. Alert all decks. Report. Bones? That's enough, Bones. Yes, well, it could have been many light years away from us. Instead it chose to turn and attack here. Why? Scotty, try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation system. See what effect that has. If you want to play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me. My concern is with the ship and the crew. On my way, Garrovick. Security to three four one. Medical alert. Scotty, reverse cabin pressure three four one. Security, hold it. Tricorder. If we let that thing into the ship, he'll have a lot of company. See if the reverse pressure has pulled it back into the ventilation system. Don't misunderstand my next question. Mister Spock, why aren't you dead? Yes. The scent is different. I think I understand something now. I don't know what it is, Mister Spock, but you remember I said the thing was alive. It may not be communication as we understand it, but I did know it was alive and intelligent, and I think I know something else now. Kirk here. Open the vent. On my way to the bridge. Kirk out. Ensign Garrovick. You were on the bridge when we were attacked. Very commendable, Ensign. What was your impression of the battle? I'm asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used against the creature. And Ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet? If you hadn't delayed firing? No difference, Ensign. No weapon known would have made any difference. Then or eleven years ago. Report for duty, Ensign. Report, Mister Chekov. Direction, Mister Spock. Mister Scott, I'll need all the speed you can deliver. Keep at it until we begin to shake apart. Kirk out. I believe I know where it's going. No, I'm playing intuition. Mister Chekov, compute a course for Tychos star system. Ahead full. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet and the Yorktown. Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of that system. That's the location of its attack on the Farragut eleven years ago. In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was somehow different. Something in my mind said home. Yes, I think I do. I don't know how I know, but home is where it fought a starship once before. Ito Uhura) Inform them of our tactical situation and inform them I'm committing this vessel to the destruction of the creature. We will rendezvous. Round-trip time, Mister Chekov. We will rendezvous with the Yorktown in forty eight hours. You don't agree with Mister Spock? Antimatter seems our only possibility. Contact medical stores. I want as much haemoplasm as they can spare in the transporter room in fifteen minutes. We must get it to the antimatter. It seems attracted to red blood cells. What better bait could we have? The blast, yes. A chance we'll have to take, Mister Spock. That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself. Negative, Mister Spock. In case this plan fails, I'll need you aboard the ship. In that event, we'll need another plan. I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick. Kirk to Enterprise. Proceed immediately to maximum orbit. Let's hope it's as powerful as man will ever get. Detonator. Kirk to Enterprise. Antimatter container positioned and armed. I'll call you back when it's baited. Kirk out. We'll need something else for bait. Garrovick, get back to the ship. Tell them to prepare to detonate. I said, get back to the ship. Ensign, I gave you an order. Consider yourself on report. This is no time for heroics. I have no intention of sacrificing myself, at least not yet. Spock? Spock? Scan us and lock on to us. It's going to be close. Very, very close. Stand by. Stand by, Enterprise. Stand by, Enterprise. Now! Energise and detonate! That's a fair statement, Bones. Now that the creature is dead, let's save some lives. We'll deliver your medicine. Bridge, this is Kirk. Have Mister Chekov lay in a course for a rendezvous with the Yorktown, maximum warp. Oh, Ensign, meet me in my quarters when you've cleaned up. I'd like to talk to you about your father. Several tall stories I think you'd like to hear."

Holding steady. Yes, sir. I'd say it measured from ten to sixty cubic metres, sir. It varied in size, fluctuated as it moved. It was like a, a gaseous cloud. Parts of it I could see through. Other parts were more dense. Did I what, sir? No, sir. No, sir. I was furthest away from it. It seemed to come out of nowhere, hovered for a moment, then moved toward my men. It was fast, incredibly fast. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I did. About twenty yards, sir. Yes. I, er, well, I didn't fire while it was hovering, sir. No, sir. I didn't exactly freeze. Well, I was startled for a second. And then by the time I fired, the thing was already moving. No, sir. I only hesitated for a moment, sir. I'm sorry. Yes, sir. I'm not hungry. What's happening? What do you mean, out of it? I caused it. You know that, too, don't you? If I'd fired my phaser quickly enough on Argus Ten, this wouldn't have happened. I told you, Christine, I'm not hungry. Captain, request permission to return to my post. Come in. Yes, sir. Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here Sir, it's coming through the vent. Sir, the creature's in my cabin. It's got Mister Spock. I must have jammed the vent control when I hit it. He saved my life, Captain. I should be lying dead in there, not him. Yes, sir. Yes, I'm sorry, sir. I know I was confined to quarters, but when the alert sounded I don't understand, sir. Ineffective, Captain. I realise, Captain, you did everything you could do. I know that. It's just that nothing works against a monster that can do the things that thing does. I delayed firing. Yes, Captain. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. I'd like permission to go with you, sir. Just think, Captain, less than one ounce of antimatter here is more powerful than ten thousand cobalt bombs. Aye, sir. Captain, look! The haemoplasm. The bait's already taken. Sir, that thing only feeds on blood. Captain, you're not going to be the bait. Yes, sir. I can smell it, Captain. It's sickening. Honey sweet. Thank you, sir. I would. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

7423,TOS,episode 43,SPOCK,"Enterprise. Spock here. Acknowledged. Co-ordinates received. Spock here, Captain. May I have a word with you? Concerning the situation you related to us. In my opinion, the Argelian empathic contact is an interesting phenomenon, but the technique is not sound enough to risk a man's life. Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board the Enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth. Quite clear, Captain. Anger is a relative state, sir. Were you angry enough to do violence? Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact, Captain. To us, perhaps, but to the computer? Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac. There is no such word in the linguistics bank? Scan all other banks. Define. Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life forms we know of. There are entities possessed of extremely long life spans, virtually immortal. In the strict scientific sense, Doctor, we all feed on death. Even vegetarians. Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer was not human. Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions. Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes. Correlate hypotheses. Compare with life forms register. Question. Could such an entity within discussed limits exist in this galaxy? Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity. Working. To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist without form in conventional sense. Most probable mass of energy of highly cohesive electromagnetic field. I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old Earth and was never identified. I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all but the victim to the presence of the killer. And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species. Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth. I can appreciate your position, sir. You are in charge of civil disturbances locally. If you are the entity for which we search, what better position from which to kill with impunity? An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep. The entity would be as a hungry wolf in that fold. Computer. Report on analysis of Exhibit A. Specify. Point of origin. The computer will not respond to these controls. The entity is unquestionably controlling it. It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked. Indeed, it will try, but not immediately. We know it feeds on fear and terror. There are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard this ship. Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills. Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control Indeed. If we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them. Apparently our friends learned very quickly. Freefall! We don't have much time, Captain. Normal environmental levels have been restored, Captain, but it will not last long. A few hours at best. Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time. It is attempting to generate terror, Captain. Ready. Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive. Compute to the last digit the value of pi. As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without resolution. The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else until we order it to stop. There is resistance, Captain, but the directive is succeeding. Bank after bank is turning to the problem. Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled. Possibly, Doctor. Its consciousness may continue for some time, consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in space, powerless. Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity."

7431,TOS,episode 43,MCCOY,"That's an understatement if I ever heard one. This is a completely hedonistic society. My work, Jim. This is prescription stuff. Don't forget, the explosion that threw Scotty against a bulkhead was caused by a woman. Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, considerable psychological damage could have been caused. For example, his total resentment toward women. Of course, in my professional opinion, when he gets back to the ship, he's going to hate you for making him leave Argelius. But then he will have lost total resentment toward women. Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go. She's dead, Jim. You're not a native of Argelius, sir? Jim. If he says he can't remember, he probably doesn't. You know Scotty. You don't think by any chance that Scotty But you don't just throw him to the wolves. But he's suffering from a severe concussion. The Argelian empathic contact? Prefect, it will give us a detailed account of everything that's happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty four hours. Prefect, the psycho-tricorder will require privacy to be effective. Captain, under normal conditions, Scotty would have never done such a thing. Of course, there's another possibility. Hysterical amnesia. When a man feels guilty about something, something too terrible to remember, he blots it out of his conscious memory. She's dead, Jim. Just like the other one. Go ahead, Scotty. Is that all that happened? It could be, Jim. That head injury. Locks can be picked, Jim. Sorry, Jim. The lock may or may not have been picked. It would be hard to tell even with the tricorder. I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim. Scotty simply could not have done it. There would be no room for doubt. We would know. And after all, that's what we're after, isn't it, Prefect? To know? Captain, I don't see how that can be. That devours all life and light. Yes. Redjac, Beratis and, er, Kesla. Sybo said it feeds on death. Yes, but she said more than that. Not just death, but fear. She said it also feeds on fear. Extremely possible There are many such examples that exist in nature. Just after you left Jaris' house, we discovered the murder knife was missing. He's dead, Jim. Scotty, give me a hand. I've got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano. If you drive it out of the computers, it'll have to go somewhere else. I'm almost finished. Just Jaris and me. Well, it might take up knitting, but nothing more violent than that. And you and Mister Spock, Captain. No, I don't think so. I think I ought to stay clear. You'd better be careful. You're going to hurt somebody with that thing. Well, Jaris is all right. That thing can't die. I don't know. Five or six hours. I gave them a pretty big shot, Jim. I know the place, Jim."

7435,TOS,episode 43,SULU,"Captain, the life-support system override jammed. Aye, sir. This is the first time I heard a malfunction threaten us. Aye, sir. What's going on, Captain? Captain? Who ever he is, he sure talks gloomy. With an armful of this stuff, I wouldn't be afraid of a supernova. I wonder who it is we're not supposed to be afraid of."
7436,TOS,episode 43,SCOTT,"Captain, I think I'm going to like Argelius. You mean to tell me all these women, that all this is Aye. Why shouldn't I? Now that's what I call a real Captain. Always thinking of his men. Now no one has to tell an old Aberdeen pub-crawler how to applaud, Captain. 'Tis a fine foggy night tonight, and I doubt if anyone's ever told you of the marvellous fogs we have in Aberdeen. Well then, why don't I show you? There's nothing like a walk in the fog with a bonny lass. You don't mind, do you? I might even get back to the ship on time. I, I don't remember. We were walking in the fog. I was up ahead trying to lead the way. I heard the girl scream. I remember starting to turn. I don't remember another thing. I certainly hope so, sir. I can't stand this not knowing. Lieutenant? Captain? Where's Dead? But I I was sitting there. She was taking her readings, and now I'm sitting here. I tell you, I don't remember. I must have passed out. Captain, I've been trying. I can't even believe this is really happening. Captain, you mean my neck is going to have to depend on some spooky mumbo jumbo? No, Captain. Scotty, I'm sorry. You don't even remember whether you did it or not. Sir, I swear to you I did not kill your wife or the other ladies. Aye. Aye. I understand. Captain's log, stardate 3615.4. With Mister Scott in a technical state of arrest, we have beamed aboard the Enterprise to continue the investigation. I'm not lying, Captain. I don't remember a thing about the first two murders. Captain? I didn't black out when Mister Jaris' wife was killed. We were holding hands. When the lights went out, the circle was broken. I heard the poor lady scream, and as I was near the head of the table anyway I went toward her. But there was something in my way. No, Captain, some thing. Cold, it was, like a stinking draught out of a slaughterhouse, but it wasn't really there. Like it. If you know what I mean. No, Captain. That I'm sure of. Twenty two sir. Morla on the one side and you on the other, sir. I don't remember. I don't remember. Captain! Well, sir? What did you do with that thing, Captain? Did you send it back to the planet? Why not? For a while there I didn't know whether I was innocent or guilty. Let's go see!"
7437,TOS,episode 43,KIRK,"Obviously a man of good taste. Yes, yes, yes. The Argelians think very highly of their pleasure. Do you like her, Scotty? Good. I've invited her to join us at the table. I thought you might like to meet her. Scotty, Scotty. In Argelius they use the lights. Have one of our pillows? We won't leave without you, Scotty. Relax and enjoy yourself. My work is never done. Physically he's all right. Am I right in assuming that? He seems he's overcoming his resentment. Mission accomplished as far as Scotty is concerned. Bones, I know a little place across town where the women Stabbed, a dozen times. We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist. Scotty, you left the cafe with the girl. Do you remember that? What happened next? Scotty, you've got to remember. I know a murder's been committed. It doesn't make any difference what I think. Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility. This happened under Argelian jurisdiction. If they want to arrest him, try him, even convict him, I have to go along with it. We'll do what we can. Yes. Mister Hengist, there were other people in the cafe about the time of the murder. Several of them left just before Mister Scott and the girl did. What's the law in these cases? Yes, we've heard of it. I assumed it was a lost art. Depending on your wife's empathic abilities is all very well, Prefect, but there's only one way we can find out what it is Mister Scott cannot remember. Since you find it impossible to let us go back up to our ship, I can beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Spock, beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder, please. Use these co-ordinates. Kirk out. Well, that would be most unfortunate. Argelian hospitality is well-known, as well as its strategic importance as a space port. Lieutenant, I want a twenty four hour regressive memory check made on Mister Scott. Scotty, co-operate completely with Lieutenant Tracy. Maybe we'll clear this thing up. But that blow on the head. It could put all his previous behaviour patterns into the junk heap. Explain. The knife? No. Scotty. Stabbed over and over again. Lieutenant Tracy is dead, Scott. You were found alone in the room. What happened down there? That head injury. Think, Scotty. There's no way into that place from up here. Prefect, is there another entrance to that chamber? Check it. Where've they been during the past few minutes? There's been another murder, Hengist. One of my crew. Stabbed. And there's no sign of the weapon. You. You were a musician at the cafe. You played for the murdered girl. And you. You left the cafe before Scott and Kara. Did you know Kara? Jealousy has often been a motive for murder. Can you prove you went directly home? Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there. Well of course I'm trying to save my friend, if he's innocent. And he hasn't been proven guilty. On one condition, Prefect. That the room be sealed so that no one can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on. Kirk here. Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen. Yes, Mister Spock? What do you suggest, Mister Spock? These are a proud people. They have their own customs, their own laws, and while we're here we're subject to them. It is absolutely imperative that this matter be resolved according to Argelian law. Is that clear? I don't like it any more than you do, Spock, but there's nothing we can do about it. Kirk out, Three murders, and Scotty the only possible answer each time. Normally, no, but that blow on his head could I agree with you, Captain. I'm perfectly satisfied Mister Scott is guilty. But not responsible. We can prove it, if he's insane. That's what we hope to find out, sir. Mister Hengist. On the Enterprise, we can make a recording of the registrations of Mister Scott's conscious and subconscious mind. They will tell us what happened to him in the recent past. No doubt will remain. Each testifier will sit here, place his hand on this plate. Any deviation from factual truth will be immediately detected and relayed to this computer which will in turn notify us. Doctor McCoy has already fed the computer his medical reports. Our laboratory experts are examining the murder weapon and will give their data to the computers for analysis. Shall we begin? Mister Scott, will you take the stand? Computer, identify verification. Subject's present physical condition. Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia? Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory. Computer, accuracy scan. All right, Scotty, let's have it. Something? You mean someone. Computer. All right. Let's hit it on the head. Scotty, did you kill Sybo? Scotty, lie to me. How old are you? After the lights went out, Mister Scott, who was holding your hand? The verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't kill her. Mister Scott. Did you kill Kara? Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? Computer, accuracy scan. After we take the testimony here, we'll run a psycho-tricorder analysis of Mister Scott's memory, which is what we wanted to do on the surface. That will give us a complete record. Will that satisfy you, Mister Hengist? There will be no error. As for the rest of it, the readings will show. You can step down, Mister Scott, if there are no objections. We can ask no more. Mister Morla, will you take the stand? Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered? Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? Did you kill Sybo? Computer, verification scan. All right, Mister Morla, I think you can step down now. Sybo spoke of a hunger that never dies. Something that thrives on fear, terror, death. Mister Spock, maybe we're going about it in the wrong way. Let's assume that Sybo was a sensitive. That she did sense something, something evil. All right, then, what was it she said, exactly? A monstrous evil, ancient terror. She said something else, words that didn't make sense. Obscure, meaningless words. Ah. Mister Spock, check them out. Jack the Ripper? Yes, all men die. And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he were a man. But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper, which is an impossibility, isn't it? Or is it? We know that someone or something killed three women. If it's impossible for it to be human, it has to be something else. Something driven to kill. No, Mister Hengist, not ghosts. Possibly not human, but not ghosts. Mister Spock, check out the possibilities. Computer, could the described entity assume physical form? No, I've seen the mellitus myself. In its natural state, it's gaseous. When it's at rest, it's solid. Mister Spock, let's assume the existence of this creature. Doesn't seem likely, does it? All right, Mister Spock, what do we have? A creature without form, that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape to kill. Computer. Criminological files. Cases of unsolved mass murders of women since Jack the Ripper. Yes. When man moved out into the galaxy, that thing must've moved with him. Computer, identify the proper names Kesla and Beratis. You come from Rigel Four. No, but what we're investigating is. Would you mind taking the stand, Mister Hengist? And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered. Perhaps. Mister Spock. The murder weapon. Now then, Mister Hengist But that's impossible. And the computer controls the ship. Audio cut off, Spock. It means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship, including the life support systems. All hands, this is the captain. Stay at your posts. Remain calm. Captain out. Bones. What's the sedative situation? Good. Start distribution immediately. The longer we can hold back that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the computer. Prefect, you'll all be safer here. Spock, come with me. Spock, don't you have a compulsory scan unit built into the computer banks? Aren't there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved? That ought to do it. Spock! Too quickly. Bridge. Out of control. Put it on manual. Bridge. That was due to be next. Life-support malfunction. You said it yourself, Spock. It wants terror, not just death. All right. Man your station, Mister Sulu. Cut that thing off. Try and cut that thing off. Man your post, Mister Sulu. Prepare your manual overrides. You may need them. Spock. That should be enough time. Let's get at it. Never mind, Mister Sulu. Tranquilliser? Everyone, including yourself. Spock? Yes, I know. If you destroy this ship, you destroy yourself. Man your post, Mister. If any of the other systems go out, switch to manual override, and above all, don't be afraid. Implement. Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while. The Argelians will be the first to panic. Let's get back to the briefing room. I doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for a while. How are you doing? Yes, but where to? Bones, what would happen if that thing entered a tranquillised body? You say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris? Well, I'm willing to take a chance on Mister Spock. Better give yourself a shot, Doc. Do as I say. Extend your arm, Mister Jaris. Let's get him to the Transporter Room, quick! Deep space. Full power. Widest angle of dispersion. Maintain. You do it, Spock. No. We beamed it out into open space, Scotty. Widest possible dispersion. But it will die finally. You seem very happy about the whole thing. Bones, how long will it take for this tranquilliser to wear off? Yes, I can see that. Well Mister Spock, for the next five or six hours, we're going to have the happiest crew in space. Of course, we won't get much work done. That's a splendid idea, Mister Spock. I know a cafe where the women are so You, gentlemen? In your condition? Don't be ridiculous. Mister Spock, this cafe has women that are so. No, I guess not. Alone? Gentlemen. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Of course he knew her. They were to be married, but he behaved disgracefully. Unheard of. He was jealous of her. That's not true! He might think she loved him, but she didn't. She told me. He was jealous. All the time. They fought constantly. A man couldn't survive all these centuries. But all men die."
7698,TOS,episode 43,HENGIST,"I don't know what to say, gentlemen. Argelius is the last planet in the galaxy I'd expect a thing like this to happen. If this was my home planet, Rigel Four, I'd have a dozen investigators working on the matter, but they don't exist here. Oh, no. Argelius hires its administrative officers from other planets. The Argelians aren't very efficient, you know. Gentle, harmless people. Mister Scott. Mister Scott? Now, are you sure you've never seen this before? Really, sir. That is hardly helpful. It's not promising, Captain. Mister Scott insists he remembers nothing, but my detector readings indicates that only his fingerprints are on the murder weapon. So I've been informed by the staff. They're being located and we will question them. But the outlook for your friend is quite grim. Gentlemen, our prefect, Jaris. Sir, Captain Kirk, Doctor McCoy. And this man is Scott, the one I sent you the message about. Prefect, don't you think this should be handled in an official manner through my office? Oh, I'd advise against it, Prefect. This is purely an Argelian matter. There are other people we should question. Perhaps I should go expedite their arrival here? Prefect, both of these men were at the cafe the night of the murder. Captain, if you don't mind please. Why, that's terrible. You, my men picked you up near there. What were you doing? Well, how was the girl killed? If only I had facilities. Captain, may I continue with the questions please? Need I remind you of the circumstances, Captain? In both cases, your friend Scott was discovered over the body and later claimed to remember nothing. I agree with you, Captain. I'm perfectly satisfied Mister Scott is guilty. That is unproven, sir. By your own admission, you don't know whether you did or didn't. Your so-called failing memory He's been saying that right along. It means no more now than it did before. But I remind you we found Mister Scott holding her in his arms, the knife still I'm sorry, sir, but I must. The knife still in her back and blood on his hands. There were two other women murdered. This is a waste of time. Well, if you can convince me that the machine is incapable of error, and if it shows he did not kill the women. I object to the entire procedure. Prefect, I know you mean well, but I've had experience That's ridiculous. He lived hundreds of years ago. Surely, Prefect, this has gone far enough. Someone, some man has killed three women. We have the prime suspect in our hands. Are we going to let him go and start chasing ghosts? Fairy tales. Ghosts and goblins. This is fantasy! We all know the murderer is sitting right here. You're trying to cloud the issue. I've got a mind to Well, many people do. It's not a crime. I will not. Prefect, this has gone far enough. I will not take the stand. Gentlemen, I know something of the law. You're engaging in sheer speculation. Everybody keep back or I'll kill her! I'll kill her! Keep back! You'll suffer! You'll suffer. I'll kill all of you. You'll die, die, die. Everybody will die. Kill, kill, kill you all. Everybody die. You'll all suffer."

Yes, there is something here. Something terrible. I feel its presence. Fear, anger, hatred. Anger feeds the flame. Oh! Oh! There is evil here. Monstrous, terrible evil. Consuming hunger. Hatred of all that lives. Hatred of women. A hunger that never dies. It is strong, overpowering. An ancient terror. It has a name. Beratis, Kesla, Redjac! Devouring all life, all light.

I know it was wrong, but I just couldn't help myself. I loved her, and when she went over to the table with these men, I could not stand to watch, so I left and went home. Prefect, I didn't kill anyone. I couldn't. But that doesn't mean anything, Captain, with a room that small. The lights were out. Anyone would've had time to kill the lady. I'm not sure. Walking home, I assume. I was angry. I've never done violence in my life. I don't think I could. You've got to believe me. I wouldn't kill her. I couldn't. I loved her, and she loved me. No. No. You mean it could kill us all?"
7704,TOS,episode 43,JARIS,"The law of Argelius is love. And this is my wife, Sybo. He does not look like a man capable of such an act. Still, it's been so long. Gentlemen, before our great awakening two hundred years ago, we had ways of learning the truth in such matters. We shall return to them. You know of this? My wife is a descendent of the ancient priestesses of our land. She has the ancestral gift. Gentlemen, I have come to invite you to my home. It shall be handled in an official manner, Mister Hengist, since I am the highest official. Gentlemen, let us proceed to my home where, with the aid of my wife, we shall learn the truth. Please. My wife must meditate for a time before she's ready. I see no reason why we should not use that time to good advantage. Very well, Captain. There is a small chamber below this room. Perhaps that will suffice. Captain, news of this frightful murder is spreading among my people. They're greatly disturbed. I have already heard talk of closing Argelius to space vehicles. Yes. I believe it's the only one in the quadrant. Captain. Yes, please do so, Mister Hengist. Anyone with any connection with this murder should be present at the ceremony. If you'll Just follow me, Lieutenant. Are you ready, Sybo? Certainly. Among other gifts, Sybo has the ability to receive impressions from inanimate objects. Do you have it, Captain? But I put it here when we arrived. It's gone. Drink this. An Argelian stimulant, Doctor. Quite effective and quite harmless. Yes, there's a door that leads into the garden, but it's been locked for years. The same as Kara. Is this true? Who are you? That is very disquieting. Yes, I know. That is why the emotion is so strongly disapproved of here. We shall see, Morla. Captain, Captain. You're behaving very much like a man who is desperately trying anything to save his friend. Would you be as desperate to save Argelius as a space port for your Starfleet? Gentlemen, sit down please. The room is sealed. Gentlemen, please. How could any man do such monstrous things? Mister Scott? You, sir, claim to remember nothing about the murders. If this is so, you may have killed without knowing it. Will your machines tell us this? Very well. We will go to your ship, and he who is guilty will face the ancient penalties, barbaric and horrible though they may be. The ancient penalty for murder was death by slow torture. That law has never been changed. Do you understand that, Mister Scott? All that proves is that he's telling the truth when he says he doesn't remember. Mister Hengist, we are here on my authority. We will co-operate. For the time being, we will accept Captain Kirk's explanation of the machine's accuracy as factual. I do, however, reserve to myself the right to make the final determination. My poor Sybo's talent was genuine, gentlemen. What she told you was true. Just before she died, my wife said, it is a hunger that never dies. Is that possible? I am satisfied the course of this investigation is valid enough. Please be seated, Mister Hengist. Mister Hengist. What does it mean? No, no, kill you all! Die! Make you suffer!"

Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact. The battle of Donatu Five was fought near here twenty three solar years ago. Inconclusive. Undeveloped. Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, our Federation and the Klingon Empire. We do have the better claim. John Burke was the Chief Astronomer at the Royal Academy in old Britain at the time. Quadrotriticale is a high-yield grain, a four-lobed hybrid of wheat and rye. A perennial, also, I believe. Its root grain, triticale, can trace its ancestry all the way back to twentieth century Canada Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence. It would seem a logical precaution, Captain. The Sherman's Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation. Nevertheless Captain, the Klingons would not enjoy seeing us successfully develop Sherman's Planet. But not totally unexpected. A most curious creature, Captain. Its trilling seems to have a tranquillising effect on the human nervous system. Fortunately, of course, I am immune to its effect. Captain, may I ask where you'll be? There's something disquieting about these creatures. Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the field. They toil not, neither do they spin. But they seem to eat a great deal. I see no practical use for them. So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one. Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics. I am frequently inundated by them, but I've trained myself to put up with practically anything. What is that, Doctor? Doctor? They do have one redeeming characteristic. They do not talk too much. If you'll excuse me, sir. Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running computations on their rate of reproduction. The figures are taking an alarming direction. They're consuming our supplies and returning nothing. Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no restraining factors. By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have, so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to escape. He simply could not believe his ears. We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano Jones. He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector. He's never broken the law, at least not severely. For the past seven years, with his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately, tribbles. Fascinating. Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station. They seem to be gorged. One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred sixty one. That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average litter of ten, producing a new generation every twelve hours over a period of three days. And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of the storage compartment. Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these. The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain. I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon commander would be necessary for that, Mister Baris. Remarkable. Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain. The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony. Seventeen point nine, to be exact. He'll do it. Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that freighter. Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the possibilities of Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering."

Their intentions are unknown. Since yesterday, Doctor. This morning, I found out that he, I mean she, had had babies. Oh, Captain. Well, I hadn't intended to, sir, but the tribble had other plans. Yes, sir. Well, all right, Doctor, but if you're going to dissect it, I don't want to know about it. Sure, why not? I think they're old enough. Go ahead. I don't know, sir. They do seem to be all over the ship. But they do give us something, Mister Spock. They give us love. Well, Cyrano Jones says a tribble is the only love that money can buy. Yes, Captain. Aye, aye.

You noticed that, huh? Here. This ought to take care of it. I haven't figured that out yet, but I can tell you this much. Almost fifty percent of the creature's metabolism is geared for reproduction. Do you know what you get if you feed a tribble too much? No. You get a bunch of hungry little tribbles. What's the matter, Spock? Don't tell me you've got a feeling. Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're nice, soft, and furry, and they make a pleasant sound. It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially if they're attractive in some way. Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet, but there's one thing that I have discovered. I like them better than I like you. Yes? What's that? Yes? Did you want to see me, Jim? Don't look at me. It's the tribbles who are breeding. If we don't get them off this ship, we're going to be hip deep in them. The nearest thing I can figure out is they're born pregnant, which seems to be quite a time saver. And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing at will. And, brother, have they got a lot of will. Jim, I think I've got it. All we have to do is quit feeding them. We quit feeding them, they stop breeding. A lot of them are dead. A lot of them are alive, but they won't be for long. I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet. All right, if I find out anything, I'll let you know. Heartbeat is all wrong. His body temperature is. Jim, this man is a Klingon. Oh, yes. It was poisoned. Yes. It's been impregnated with a virus. The virus turns into an inert material in the bloodstream. The more the organism eats, the more inert matter is built up. So after two or three days, they reached a point where they couldn't take in enough nourishment to survive. That is essentially it. And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship. I cannot take credit for another man's work. Scotty did it. Tell him, Spock."

Don't do it, mister, and that's an order. Forget it. It's not worth fighting for. We're big enough to take a few insults. Now, drink your drink. Laddie, don't you think you should rephrase that? Aye, Captain. Um. I did, Captain. They insulted us, sir. Aye, it was. Aye. Chekov wanted to, but I held him back. Well, the Klingon, sir. Is this off the record? Well, Captain, the Klingons called you, uh a tin-plated, overbearing, swaggering dictator with delusions of godhood. No, sir. They also compared you with a Denebian slime devil. And then they said you Yes, sir. No, sir. No, I didn't. You told us to avoid trouble. And I didn't see that it was worth fighting about. After all, we're big enough to take a few insults. Aren't we? They called the Enterprise a garbage scow, sir. Yes, sir. Well, sir, this was a matter of pride. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. That'll give me a chance to catch up on my technical journals. They're into the machinery, all right, and they're probably in all the other food processors too. Probably through one of the air vents. Oh, er, Captain, it was really Mister Spock's recommendation. I used the transporter, Captain. Aye. Captain Kirk, that'd be inhuman. I gave them a good home, sir. I gave them to the Klingons, sir. Aye, sir.

What is the position of the Klingon ship? Put him on visual. Mister Lurry, there's a Klingon warship hanging one hundred kilometres off your station. Why not? Cancel Red Alert. We'll beam right down. My dear Captain Koloth. Shore leave? Yes, well, I don't make those decisions. Mister Lurry is in charge of those matters. Well, I have the authority to act, and I'm going to use it. My dear Captain Koloth, you may indeed bring your men down on shore leave, but only twelve at a time. And I assure you, for every man you bring down here, I shall have one security guard. There will be no trouble. Let us both take steps to keep it that way. Another technical journal, Scotty? Don't you ever relax? You running a nursery, Lieutenant? Did you get this at the space station? Kirk here. Pipe it down here will you, Mister Chekov. Yes, Mister Baris. What can I do for you? I was not aware, Mister Baris, that twelve Klingons constitutes a swarm. Mister Baris, I have guards around the grain. I have guards around the Klingons. The only reason those guards are there is because Starfleet wants them there. As for what you want It has been noted and logged. Kirk out. Sickbay with a headache. Bones, what have you got for a headache? Both. How many of these did Uhura give you? But you've got, er, eleven. How do they? How do they? A fat tribble. Well, Bones, all I can suggest is you open up a maternity ward. All you men going on shore leave to stay in groups. Avoid trouble with the Klingons. Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty? I want you to go on shore leave. Make sure that everybody stays out of trouble. Scotty, enjoy yourself. I want to know who started it. I'm waiting. Freeman, who started the fight? All right. Chekov. I know you. You started it, didn't you? Who did? I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All right. You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it. Dismissed. Scotty, not you. You were supposed to prevent trouble, Mister Scott. Who threw the first punch, Scotty? Mister Scott? You did, Mister Scott? What caused it, Scotty? Must have been some insult. You threw the first punch. You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight? No, this is not off the record. Is that all? I see. I get the picture, Scotty. After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons? No? Oh, yes. What was it they said that started the fight? I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons? You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not because they All right, Scotty. Dismissed. Scotty, you're restricted to quarters until further notice. Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge? Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on the bridge? Doctor McCoy. Explain that. I know, but really Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a good thing. Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then contact Mister Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down. Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him. And get these tribbles off the bridge. Oh, really? Just incredibly prolific. You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this thing. On the contrary, sir. I think of this project as very important. It is you I take lightly. That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring? Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent? I heard you. What evidence do you have against Mister Jones? Yes, yes. Go on. What else do you have? Do you have any proof of that? People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon agents. Sometimes, all they need is a title, Mister Baris. Unfortunately, disrupting a space station is not an offence. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a ship to tend to. Au revoir. My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee. I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man we've got, I want them off the ship. How? And in the storage compartments. This is Kirk. Contact Manager Lurry and Nilz Baris. Have them meet us near the storage compartments. We're beaming down. Come on, Spock. Energise. Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened. Is that door secure? Good. Open it. Here. Let me try it. Hundreds of thousands. That's assuming they got here three days ago. Mister Baris Mister Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up. Now he tells me. Yes. Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed. I want to know what killed these tribbles. Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain. And as Captain, I want two things done. First, find Cyrano Jones, and second close that door. Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions. What do you want? An apology? Well, we'll see about that, but before I take any official action, I'd like to know Just what happened. Who put the tribbles in the quadrotriticale? What was in the grain that killed them? Yes. Hold on a minute. I thought you said tribbles liked everybody. What was in the bar? You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons. But they do like Vulcans. I didn't know you had it in you. Obviously. Mister Baris, they like you. Well, there's no accounting for taste. They don't like you, Mister Darvin. I wonder why. Bones? I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that. What about the grain, Bones? They starved to death. In a storage compartment full of grain, they starved to death. Mister Darvin, are you going to talk? And the tribbles had nothing to do with it? Captain Koloth. About that apology. You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory. You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles. No, you're not. There's something I want to show you. You know what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human life? There is one thing you can do. Pick up every tribble on the space station. If you do that, I'll speak to Mister Lurry about returning your spaceship. Consider it Job security. You'll do it? Good. That means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale only a few weeks late. I don't see any tribbles around here. Bones, how did you do it? Scotty! Where are the tribbles? Of course. Spock. Gentlemen, I don't want to interrupt this mutual admiration society, but I'd like to know where the tribbles are. Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles? You used the transporter? Where did you transport them? Scott, you didn't transport them into space, did you? Where are they? Where? You gave them to the Klingons?"

Effective immediately, you will render any aid and assistance which Undersecretary Baris may require. The safety of the grain and the project is your responsibility. Starfleet out."
8006,TOS,episode 44,BARIS,"That was my order, Captain. This is my assistant Arne Darvin. And now Captain, I want all available security guards. I want them posted around the storage compartments. Quadrotriticale is not wheat, Captain. Of course, I wouldn't expect you or Mister Spock to know about such things, but quadrotriticale is a rather Of course, Captain, I realise that What do you mean? I did not misuse the Priority One channel. I want that grain protected. Captain Kirk, how dare you authorise a mere two men for a project of this importance? Starfleet Command Kirk, this station is swarming with Klingons. Captain Kirk, there are Klingon soldiers on this station. Now, I want you to keep that grain safe. Captain Kirk, I consider your security measures a disgrace. In my opinion, you have taken this important project far too lightly. I am going to report fully to the proper authorities that you have given free and complete access to this station to a man who is quite probably a Klingon agent. To that man who just walked out of here. You heard me. My assistant here has kept Mister Jones under close surveillance for quite some time, and his actions have been most suspicious. I believe he was involved in that little altercation between your men and the men from The man is an independent scout, Captain. It is quite possible he is also a Klingon spy. But he is after my grain! Gorged? On my grain? Kirk, I am going to hold you responsible. There must be thousands of them. Kirk, you should have known. You are responsible for turning the development project into a total disaster. And I'm through being intimidated, Kirk. You have insulted me, you have ignored me, you've walked all over me. You have abused your authority, and you've rejected my requests. And this, this is the result. I'm going to hold you responsible. That isn't going to do you any good, Kirk. This project is ruined, and Starfleet is going to hear about it. And when they do, they will have a board of inquiry and they will roast you alive. And I am going to be there, Kirk, to enjoy every minute of it. No, Kirk. You can't let him. That will give them the wedge they need to claim Sherman's Planet. A Klingon? Poisoned? I'm certain that can be arranged, Darvin. Guards? If you'll excuse me, Captain."
8007,TOS,episode 44,BARMAN,"I don't want any. I told you before, and I'm telling you again I don't want any more Spican flame gems. Thanks to you, I have enough Spican flame gems to last me a lifetime. I use that to polish the flame gems. Not at your price. That's what we're trying to decide right now. One credit apiece. All right. I'll double my offer 2 credits. Four credits. That's my offer. Five? You're talking yourself out of a deal, friend. Six credits. Not a credit more. Done. When can I have them? Well, let me see, little lady. Six credits. Figure a reasonable mark-up for a reasonable profit, say ten percent mark-up. Ten credits. In fact, I'll sell you this one. That'll be ten credits. What are you trying to do, ruin the market? A tribble. A tribble?"
8008,TOS,episode 44,KOLOTH,"Ah, my dear Captain Kirk. Let me assure you that my intentions are peaceful. As I've already told Mister Lurry, the purpose of my presence is to invoke shore leave rights. Captain, we Klingons are not as luxury-minded as you Earthers. We do not equip our ships with, how shall I say it, non-essentials. I might also add that under terms of the Organian Peace Treaty, you cannot refuse us. Captain Kirk, there's been no formal declaration of hostilities between our two respective governments. So, naturally, our relationship will be a peaceful one. Of course. Captain Kirk! An official apology addressed to the Klingon High Command. I expect you to assume full responsibility for the persecution of Klingon nationals in this quadrant. Yes. You've harassed my men. You've treated them like criminals. You've been most uncourteous, Captain Kirk. If you wish to avoid a diplomatic incident Mister Spock, as far as Sherman's Planet is concerned, Captain Kirk has already given it to us. Captain Kirk, before you go on, may I make a request? Can you get those things out of here? Yes?"
8009,TOS,episode 44,JONES,"Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. How sad for you, my friend. You won't find a finer stone anywhere. But I have something better. Surely you want some Antarian glow water. You're a difficult man to reach, but I have something from the far reaches of the galaxy. Surely you want What is it? Why, lovely lady, it's a tribble. Only the sweetest creature known to man, excepting, of course, your lovely self. It's only saying that it likes you. My friend, 10 credits apiece is a very reasonable price. Now you can see for yourself how much the lovely little lady appreciates the finer things. Sir, transporting harmful animals from one planet to another is against regulations, or weren't you aware of that? Besides, tribbles have no teeth. Twice nothing is still nothing. Is that an offer or a joke? That's a joke. You're an honest man. I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to lessen my price to eight and a half credits. Seven and a half. Seven? All right, you robber, six credits. Right away. Thief. That happens to be my sample, and I'll do with it as I please. And I please to give it to the lovely lady. I insist. Once this lovely little lady starts to show this precious little darling around, you won't be able to keep up with them. Ah, friend. Can I offer you a charming little tribble? Oh. Perhaps one of you other gents? Ah, friend Klingon. Can I interest you in a harmless tribble? I'm sorry. I can't understand it. I've never seen them act this way before. He's only a harmless little Yes. Ah, my good friend. How would you like to enter another little transaction? This time, a tribble for a spot Indeed. Oh, yes. Captain Kirk, I'm mystified at your tone of voice. I've done nothing to warrant such severe treatment. Of course. What did you say? If by that, you mean do they breed quickly? Of course, that's how I maintain my stock. Breeding animals is not against regulations, only breeding dangerous ones. And tribbles are not dangerous. Precisely, and at six credits a head, well, that is, a body, it mounts up. Now if you'll excuse me. If I did, what would happen to man's search for knowledge? Well, I must be tending my ship. Au revoir. Really, Captain Kirk, I must protest this treatment. They do. I can't understand it. The last time I saw one act this way was at the bar. Klingons. Him, for one. Well, Captain, I suppose I'm free to go now. Captain, one little tribble isn't harmful. Captain, you wouldn't do a thing like that to me, now would you? Would you? Captain Kirk. Friend. Friend Kirk. Surely we can come to some sort of mutual understanding. After all, my tribbles did put you wise to the poisoned grain, and they did help you to find the Klingon agent. You saved a lot of lives that way. Yes? It would take years. Seventeen point nine years. Captain, you're a hard man. All right! All right! I'll do it."
8010,TOS,episode 44,FREEMAN,"Say, Lieutenant. Seeing as you're giving them away, can I have one? I don't know, sir."
8011,TOS,episode 44,KORAX,"We have been in space for five months. What we choose as recreation is our own business. Get it away from me. Get out of here with that parasite. Take it away! The Earthers like those fuzzy things, don't they? No. I just remembered. There is one Earthman who doesn't remind me of a Regulan blood worm. That's Kirk. A Regulan blood worm is soft and shapeless, but Kirk isn't soft. Kirk may be a swaggering, overbearing, tin-plated dictator with delusions of godhood, but he's not soft. That's right, and if I think that Kirk is a Denebian slime devil, well that's my opinion too. Of course, I'd say that Captain Kirk deserves his ship. We like the Enterprise. We, we really do. That sagging old rust bucket is designed like a garbage scow. Half the quadrant knows it. That's why they're learning to speak Klingonese. You're right, I should. I didn't mean to say that the Enterprise should be hauling garbage. I meant to say that it should be hauled away as garbage. Captain's Log, stardate 4525.6. A small disturbance between the Klingon crew and members of the Enterprise crew has broken out aboard Space Station K7. I am forced to cancel shore leave for both ships."
8012,TOS,episode 44,DARVIN,"Mister Baris is the Federation Undersecretary in Charge of Agricultural Affairs in this quadrant. SPOCK; That gives him the authority. The storage compartments containing the quadrotriticale. Quadrotriticale! Go ahead, sir. Tell him. Well Captain, I've checked his ship's log, and it seems that he was within the Klingon's sphere of influence less than four months ago. You can't deny he's disrupted this station. I have nothing to say. All right, I poisoned the grain! Take them away. I don't know. I never saw one before in my life, and I hope I never see one of those fuzzy miserable things again."
8013,TOS,episode 44,LURRY,"This is Mister Lurry, manager of K7. I must apologise for the distress call. Well, perhaps you better beam over. I'll try to explain. Captain Kirk, this is Nilz Baris. He's out from Earth to take charge of the development project on Sherman's Planet. Mister Spock. Quadrotriticale is the only earth grain that grows on Sherman's Planet. We have several tons of it here on the station. It's very important that grain gets to Sherman's Planet safely. Mister Baris thinks that Klingon agents may try to sabotage it. Captain, couldn't you at least post a couple of guards? We do have a large number of ships passing through. I don't think the Klingons are planning to attack us. Because at this moment the captain of the Klingon ship is sitting right here in my office. Captain, may I speak to you a minute? Look, I don't want them here, but I don't have the authority to refuse. What's wrong?"

Have you reversed controls? Power surge? Recheck your equipment, Mister Scott. I'll scan for them on the planet's surface. Spock out. I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two sweeps of the planet's surface. There is no sign of life. No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors. The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic interference, no breakdown in your equipment. We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation. True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree of contamination. They are not within the confines of this solar system. I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a fascinating project. Precisely. No. I would say approximately four hundred I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as to where to look. Captain's log, stardate 3259.2. First Officer Spock in command. The Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign Chekov have been missing for nearly two hours. Computer probability projections are useless due to insufficient data. Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail. Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor. And the answer is, nothing known to us would account for it. Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines. Doctor, I am chasing the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign Chekov, not some wild aquatic fowl. This is the only lead we've had. Initiate. Warp factor two. Projecting back along the path of ionisation, the nearest system is M two four alpha. Eleven point six three zero. I'm suggesting nothing, Doctor. I am merely pursuing the only logical course available to us. We searched the area. Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism? There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma Two. In that case, Doctor, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our present course. Mister Scott, can we manage anything faster than warp six? Doctor, I do not respond to hunches. No transporter malfunction was responsible for the disappearance. They were not within the Gamma system. A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching. No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam. Does that clarify the situation? I see. Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we shall continue on our present course. Unless it is your intention to declare a mutiny. Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven? Ensign, warp seven. Sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the planet, on the lower hemisphere. Humanoid readings. There will be no landing force, Doctor. Assuming the captain and the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by beaming down a large contingent. Interesting. No power source. It may be shielded. I shall beam down, Doctor. If I am unable to communicate, a landing party may be necessary. Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith. But I welcome your company, Doctor. Mister Scott, you'll be in command. Fascinating."

17,TOS,episode 45,ONE,"Hold. Provider One bids three hundred quatloos for the newcomers. Two thousand. Accepted. Mark them, Galt. Is that what you humans call compassion? It is interesting, but it has no value here. You present many interesting aspects, Captain, but you must learn obedience. Then you will be an excellent thrall. Only a reminder. You Earth people are most unusual, most stimulating. No, Mister Spock, you will not leave the ship. None of your control systems will operate. Commendations, gentlemen. Your ingenuity in discovering the whereabouts of your companions is noteworthy. We are known to the thralls as Providers because we provide for all their needs. The term is easier for their limited mental abilities to comprehend. Your species has great curiosity. We knew that. You are interesting in many ways. You present no danger while you wear the collar And you wear it as long as you live. There is no objection. We are one thousand of your metres beneath the surface. The thralls are necessary to the games. We have found athletic competitions our only challenge, the only thing which furnishes us with purpose. We use only inferior beings. Your ship will be destroyed by a magnetic storm. No communications with your base will be possible. Your fate will remain a mystery to your people. Wager? Explain yourself, Captain. Four hundred quatloos against the newcomers. Name your stakes, Captain. And if you lose, Captain? Your stakes are indeed high, Captain. As leader of your people, your spirit seems most indomitable. We suggest you alone, pitted against three contestants of our choosing. On the contrary, they're extremely fair, since your alternative is death. Galt will prepare you. Because you wager your skill for all your people, they will be permitted to watch the outcome of the game on the ship's viewscreen. Captain, you will defend. Thralls must stay in the blue area. You will take the yellow. Touching an opposing colour deprives a contestant of one weapon. An opponent must be killed to be removed from the game. If only wounded, he is replaced by a fresh thrall. Is that clear, Captain? You have won, Captain Kirk, unfortunately. However, the terms of the wager will be honoured. You are free. Remove your collars. They will be trained. We have said it."

We can't just leave them out there, wherever they are. Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock. It's been nearly an hour. Can people live that long as disassembled atoms in a transporter beam? Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if they're still alive. The odds are not good. Don't quote odds and don't give me anymore dispassionate logic, Mister Spock. Just keep looking for them. First time you've ever asked me for anything, and it has to be an occasion like this. What would account for that, Spock? You're going to leave here without them and run off on some wild goose chase halfway across the galaxy just because you found a discrepancy in a hydrogen cloud? This is ridiculous. There's nothing out there. Nothing at all. Are you suggesting that they could have transported over a distance of? You're out of your Vulcan mind, Spock. If they weren't there it's ridiculous to think they could still be alive. Not after all this time. He's right, Spock. We've lost Jim and the others on Gamma Two. Now you've dragged us a dozen light years on some wild hunch that No, it doesn't. It's still a fancy way of saying that you're playing a hunch. well, my hunch is that they're back on Gamma Two dead or alive and I still want another search. Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared. All right. If we don't find them here, do we still have another search on Gamma Two? Well, at least that gives our landing force a starting point. Well we're not going to leave them there while we just sit and wait. And it may be just a wild goose chase like we've been telling you. Well, Mister Spock, if you're going into the lion's den, you'll need a medical officer. What the devil's going on? What in the name of heaven is this?"

27,TOS,episode 45,SCOTT,"Aye, Captain. Scott to Bridge. Mister Spock, the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Chekov. they vanished. They got onto the transporter platform and they just vanished. Aye, of course I mean that. You think I'd call if they just beamed down? I've made all the proper checks. There was nothing. There was no flash of light, nothing. They were gone. Not down here. All the dials were right and the transporter was functioning perfectly. Mister Spock, I've checked that transporter from one end to the other. Every circuit works perfectly. Whatever that power surge was, it had nothing to do with the transporter or any other system aboard this ship. Where are they then? Well, the transporter has neither the power nor the range to account for that. We certainly seem to be heading into an empty sector. That must be two dozen light years away. Mister Spock, it just doesn't make sense they could have come this far. If there's any chance at all it is to continue to search in the area they were lost. It's always possible to miss something. No, sir. There was no sign of failure. It's my opinion that we've gone too far as it is, sir. Doctor McCoy speaks for me, too, sir. Mister Spock! I would be more than content to do so, sir, and maybe a wee bit more. Aye, sir. What the voice said was true, sir. Nothing is functioning. Mister Spock, look! Heaven's got very little to do with this. Aye, sir."
28,TOS,episode 45,KIRK,"Ensign Chekov, Lieutenant Uhura, and I will beam down and make a routine check of its facilities. Good. Mind the store, Mister Spock. Lieutenant Uhura, let's go. Energise, Scotty. It must be a transporter malfunction. This isn't Gamma Two. Look at the colour of that sky. That's a trinary sun. That's what I'd like to know. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Dead. Phasers on stun. Fire. Hand-to-hand. Captain's log, stardate 3211.8. While beaming down from the Enterprise to inspect facilities on Gamma Two, the normal transporter sequence has been interrupted, and we find ourselves on a strange and hostile planet, surrounded by creatures belonging to races scattered all through the galaxy. Either of you hurt? How do you know our names? These Providers of yours, are they What do they want from us? Thralls? You must be mistaken. We're officers of a United spaceship on Federation business. We're not going anywhere until we have some information. Who are you? What is this place? What do you think you're going to do with us? This system's star is a trinary. Limits it a bit, but we're a long way from the Enterprise, if we're in the same dimension. What do you want from her? Lieutenant, are you all right? Uhura! Lieutenant! Lieutenant, are you all right? Lieutenant, answer me! Lieutenant! What's happening to Lieutenant Uhura? Lieutenant, are you all right? I didn't realise I was so hungry. Whatever you call this, it is very good. Nourishment. That's very practical. What do you call this collar? Vended? You mean bought, sold. Our race has another name for it. Slavery. This collar of obedience, is Galt the only one who can operate it? How does he work it? Will you provide all my nourishment? Yes, I'm sure you will. I must say, I've never seen a top sergeant who looked like you. It means you're a very beautiful woman. You mean nobody's ever told you that before? well, er, beautiful is, Beautiful. That's beautiful. Shahna, where were you born? Your parents. Where are they? Your mother and father. Freestyle? Lars and Chekov's drill thrall. They weren't born here. Where do they come from? None of us will do it, Galt. The devil with the Providers. No. No! I am responsible for the actions of my people. I demand to see the Providers. He's pretty fast with that whip. We're free people. We belong to no one. Slow down. Slow down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We've covered over two miles. Can we take a breather? A rest? Oh. well, it's good to get away from that development area, even for a while. Shahna, why do the Providers, why do they like to watch others being hurt, killed? Their voices sound mechanical. Are they computers? You've seen them. Do they have bodies? What is this place? It's very old. Does it have a name? Shahna, could it have been a city for the Providers? They do have bodies, or did have. Very pretty country. Very much like my home planet, Earth. Where I was born. Shahna, don't you ever look at the night sky? The lights up there? Well, those are stars. And around them are planets. And there are people that live on them, Just like us. From Earth, Triskelion's three suns are just a flicker of light. Actually, this is the darkest planet I've ever seen. The thralls have no freedom, Shahna. You don't think or do anything but what the Providers tell you. Love, for one thing. Love is the most important thing on Earth. Especially to a man and a woman. On Earth, we select our own mate. Someone we care for. On Earth, men and women live together, help each other, make each other happy. All right. All right. Tell me about the Providers. What do they look like? Where do they live? Stop it. Stop it! I'm responsible! I made her talk! Stop it! You're killing her! She did nothing wrong! It was my fault. If you want to punish someone, punish me! Please. It's all right. It's all right. You can stop crying now, Shahna. It's all right. It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in trouble. You could call it that. You're disturbed about what happened today. I wouldn't like that, Shahna. I wouldn't like that at all. I'm sorry, Shahna. What about Lars? I think Galt is the only one who controls these collars. If we can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to short out these collars. Spock? Spock! Spock? Welcome to Triskelion, gentlemen. By now it must be obvious to you that you have been expected. What you're hearing, gentlemen, is a Provider. Providing for all their needs means using thralls, people stolen from other parts of the galaxy To fight each other, and the Providers gamble on the winner. But these Providers haven't the courage to show themselves. But you are afraid. Then show yourselves. The power source. Shielded by solid rock. Primary mental evolution. Incredible. A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally or otherwise. It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect. We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior development. Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe. Our destruction will result only in your own. You may control the Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation. And you call yourselves superior! You're murderers without the spirit to really wager for the lives you take. My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful gamblers in the universe. We compete for everything. Power, fame, women, everything we desire, and it is our nature to win. And for proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy. Well, then, I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls set against us. Wait! Wait! Hear me! We can't wager for trifles like quatloos. The stakes must be higher. If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety. Further more, all the thralls on the planet must be freed. You will educate and train them to establish a normal self-governing culture. We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy. Are you willing to admit that we can do something you can't? If we lose? We will remain here, the entire crew of the Enterprise. The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe. We'll become thralls, enter your games, obey your orders without rebellion. You'll be assured of generations of the most exciting wagering you've ever had. Not for true gamesters. Name it. Three against one? Those are pretty high odds. Your, your terms are unfair. Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms. Yes, that's clear. The thralls will be trained? I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one you've been playing. I'm sorry, Shahna. I didn't lie. I did what was necessary. Someday, I hope you'll understand. Yes. Yes. I can't. There's so much you must learn here first. The Providers will teach you. Learn it, Shahna. all your people must learn before you can reach for the stars. Shahna. Scotty! Beam us up."

It was hoped that such new blood would stimulate our stock of thralls. How unfortunate that you must be destroyed. Two hundred quatloos against! Anarchy. They would starve. There is nothing we cannot do! Not for true gamesters, Captain."

Your spirit is as great as the captain's. I can see you all will prove invaluable here. I am Galt, Master Thrall of the planet Triskelion. I have been sent to welcome you. There, Captain. Now you are prepared for your training. The Providers were expecting you, Captain. They arranged your transportation. Correction, Captain. The Providers are not ours. We are theirs. You are to be trained, of course. What other use is there for thralls? There has been no mistake. Your old titles mean nothing here, Captain. You are thralls now. You are to be taken to the training enclosure. Come. Places have been prepared for you. I am Galt, the Master Thrall. This place is the planet Triskelion. You are to be trained and spend the rest of your lives here. These are your quarters. Open, thralls. That was foolish, Captain.

As you charge, you will strike the practice target when you pass. You begin, Uhura. It is not allowed to refuse a training exercise. It is part of your training. The Providers wish it. We have been tolerant because you are newcomers, but I see you must be given a lesson. Lars. Kloog. Kloog will administer correction. Uhura, take your place on the triad. Tie her. It is not permitted. But, Captain, since you assume responsibility for your people, you will take the punishment. It is less painful than the collar. Turn around. {Lars ties Kirk's hands.)

Fifteen trisecs. Resume places. We hold, Provider One. Two thousand quatloos are bid. Is there a challenge? The newcomers have been vended to Provider One. You now bear the mark of a fine herd. But I must warn you, any further disobedience now that you are full-fledged thralls will be punishable by death. Captain, you do indeed present many surprises. Because you have amused the Providers, there will be no punishment. Return to your quarters. Shahna."

When you are vended, you will also have a colour. When you are developed. The Provider who offers the most quatloos puts his colour on us. It is only to warn and punish. It is not permitted to talk of that. Of course. I am your drill thrall. I will train you well. What does that mean? What is beautiful? Born? I have been here always.

What else would one do? What is love? We, too, have mates. When it is time to increase the herd, my Provider will select one for me. I do not think your words are allowed. I have never seen them, but they are said not to be like us. They stay in You risked bringing their anger on yourself. Why did you do it? And this. Is this also helping? Please, help me once again. I did not know it could be like this between people. Is it always so in the place you come from? Yes. You have made me feel strangely. If it were allowed, I would ask that you have another drill thrall. You lied. Everything you said. The thralls surrender! I understand, a little. You will leave us now? To go back to the lights in the sky? I would like to go to those lights with you. Take me? Then teach me how, and I will follow you. Goodbye, Jim Kirk.

The damage has been done, Doctor. We are here to repair it. Fascinating. Interesting, Captain. Passers-by are carrying, I believe, firearms. Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please? Sir, does everyone here carry firearms? Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask. Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako? Captain? Gangsters. Chicago. Mobs. Published in 1992. Where'd you get this? This is the contamination, Captain. Astonishing. An entire culture based on this. Fascinating, but quite impossible. They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society. We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one. This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy. Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it. I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares. There aren't games I have never computed them, Captain. Surely, you're coming, Captain. Very simple. Amplitude modulation transmission. I simply adjust the frequency, throw this switch, and the Enterprise should answer. Fascinating. Let me see. Enterprise, this is Mister Spock. A very long and complicated story, Lieutenant. Notify the transporter room, Two to beam up, these co-ordinates. Futile, Doctor. No specifics. There is no record of such a culture based on a moral inversion. No, Doctor. I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no logical, rational, factual way out of our current dilemma. On audio, Lieutenant. Mister Oxmyx, this is Mister Spock. Irrelevant, since we are here. Why would he put a bag on our captain? If I understand you correctly, that would seem to be a problem. I'm afraid I find it difficult to trust you, Mister Oxmyx. You'll show no further hostility? Since we must have our captain back, I accept. We shall arrive in your office within ten minutes. Spock out. If we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful interference on this planet, Doctor, we must have the assistance of someone indigenous. We are therefore forced to trust Mister Oxmyx. Mister Scott, though we hope to avoid interference, I suggest you set one of our phaser banks on a strong stun position. I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be prepared. Energise. Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce. Sir, you are employing a double negative. I fail to see why you do not understand us. You yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet. We agree. Co-operation, sir, would inevitably result We did, Captain. The situation required our return. Nothing useful. Logic and practical information do not seem to apply here. To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor. I'm not sanguine about hunches, Captain, but I have no practical alternative. A fliwer, Captain. Interesting. Yes. Oh. I believe they had a device known as a clutch. Clutch, Captain. Perhaps one of those pedals on the floor. Captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi driver you leave much to be desired. If we can get close enough to them, we should be able to render them harmless with reasonable rapidity. I beg your pardon? Young man Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous. You do not even know what the action is going to be. Logical. Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says. I just heard the sound of Unquestionably. Right. A miniscule. A very small piece. Right. Check. Must we? But not as safe. Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me. I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx. Brooding, Captain? Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre. But I do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the Iotians. Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain. I'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut. Captain. If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative people, should take that communicator apart The transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment that we have."

Well, since this Oxmyx asked us down here, don't you think we should see him? That man's dead back there. This is the contamination you're looking for, Jim. Yes. Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree. You said they were imitative, and the book One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this. It's amazing. It's the Bible. Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all. Jim, you can't You do that very well. Now, how are you with primitive radio equipment? And very simple. Well? You mean you're giving up? You mean you're going to trust him? Now you're beginning to make sense. We're trying to help you, Oxmyx. You admit that? What are we going to do now, Jim? Where are they? Jim. I don't know how serious this is, Jim, and I don't quite know how to tell you But in all the confusion I I think I left it in Bela's office. Somewhere. I'm not certain. I left my communicator.

Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the Federation of Planets. Yes. Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet. We only received her radio report last month. Difficult to explain. We received a report a hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio. Your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy. They didn't have subspace communication in those days. I'll explain it in more detail when I see him. The ship won't land, but we'll transport several people down. Well, that's a little difficult for you to understand, too. I'll explain it in more detail when I see you. Where will be convenient? Scotty, do you have the co-ordinates? Good. I'll be looking forward to it. Kirk out. Scotty, you have the conn. Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down. Standard equipment. The Horizon's contact came before the Non-Interference Directive went into effect. We don't know there is contamination. The evidence is only circumstantial. The beginnings of industrialisation. Let's not argue about it. Let's go study it. Energise. Home was never like this. I've seen pictures of the old days that look like this. That's a weapon. Be careful with that. Look, we were asked to come down here by Mister Oxmyx. He said Is this how you greet all your guests? Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers. They didn't report this culture in this state, either. What happened? Is this the way your citizens do business, their right of petition? Depends. No, thank you. You're Mister Oxmyx. This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy. They call you The Boss, Mister Oxmyx. The boss of what? You're the government here? But there are other bosses, other territories? I know it's a book. Did they leave any other books? What is it you want? Now let me get this straight. You want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours? Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. Under no circum Don't do that. You could knock out the side of the building. Out of the question. Hold it. It's a communication device. It's locked onto my ship's systems. In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down. The gangs nearly took over. If this society broke down as the result of the Horizon's influence, then the Federation's responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out. Spock, if you could get to the sociological computer, do you think you could find a solution? Well, I've got an idea about that. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. This, card game is a kid's game. Oh, yes, yes. I wouldn't waste my time. On Beta Antares Four, they play a real game. It's a man's game, but of course it's probably a little beyond you. It requires intelligence. Spock. Spock. Of course, the cards on Beta Antares Four are different, but not too different. The name of the game is called fizzbin. Fizzbin. It's not too difficult. Each player gets six cards, except for the player on the dealer's right, who gets seven. Yes. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays. Oh, look what you got, two jacks. You got a half fizzbin already. No, no. If you got another jack, why, you'd have a sralk. Yes. You'd be disqualified. You need a king and a deuce, except at night of course, when you'd need a queen and a four. Right. Oh, look at that. You've got another jack. How lucky you are! How wonderful for you. If you didn't get another jack, if you'd gotten a king, why then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, you'd give it back. Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron. Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin? Well, they're astronomical, believe me. Now, for the last card. We'll call it a kronk. You got that? Spock, find the radio station. Uhura's monitoring the broadcasts. Cut in and have yourselves beamed up to the ship. I will, but I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx with me. Bones, this mess is our responsibility. You have your orders. Let's go. If you don't mind, I'd rather walk. I'm beginning to get the idea. And you? Would you mind telling me how you even know who I am? You want to make a deal. Let me guess. You want, you'll want heaters, and then you'll want troops to teach them how to use them. And then you'll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet. Then we'll sit down and talk, right? I got a better idea. This planet has to be united. You know that. Bela knows that. Let's sit down. You, me, Bela. Discuss this whole matter, contact the other bosses, and talk about it like reasonable men. No, I don't think you're stupid. I just think your behaviour is arrested. I'm sorry, Krako. No deal. Help me! Help! Help me! Drop the guns. Drop 'em. Move down there. I thought you were supposed to report to the ship, Mister Spock. It may be just as well. Did you find out anything from the computer? Then you don't mind if I play a hunch? Well, now that we have Bela, I'm going to put the bag on Krako. Listen, you. Say, that's nice material. I said. You too! Get out of the clothes. Nobody's going to put the bag on me any more. Wheels, Mister Spock. Key in the ignition. Turn the ignition on. And nothing happens. Where's the starter? There's the starter. Yes! Oops! Gears. I kind of like this. I'm going to get one myself. It was that bad? Now, that could be a bit of a problem. If they were inside, where they couldn't be seen, we could stun them with our phasers, but not out here. They don't look like the trusting type. Young man, run along and play. Hold on, Spock. Out of the mouths of babes I'm calling you a babe. Yeah I'm calling you a babe, but there's nothing personal in it. Sit down. You know a way we can get close to them? How? What do you want? All right, young man. We'll guarantee you a piece of the action if we can pull this thing off. Done. What do we do? That's it. Let's go. Sonny! Sonny! Wait a moment. What have they done? What have they done to you? What have you done? A piece of the action. No one can see. Put your phaser on stun. I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako. The sound of a machine gun bolt being pulled back. Mister Krako, I don't, er I'm trying to tell you, Mister Krako, that this is bigger than you, Oxmyx or anyone. Can you trust all your men? Well, one of these can make a man a pretty big boss, you know. All right, Krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with toys! What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal? Forget it. That's peanuts to an outfit like the Federation. Right? Right? Now look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax. You co-operate with us and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action. That's, er. We'll figure it out later. Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check? The planet is being taken over by the Federation, but we don't want to come in here and use our muscle, you know what I mean? That ain't subtle. So what we do is we help one guy take over the planet. He pulls the strings, and then we pull his. Hey, you, sit down. What do you care as long as you're being cut in? Course, there's always Bela Oxmyx. Kirk to Enterprise. All right, Scotty. We made a deal with Krako. Yeah. We're ready to make the hit. We're taking over the whole planet as soon as you get ready. Sure. We can trust Krako, but we don't have any choice. You know what I mean? He's standing about twelve feet in front of me, all ready to be our pal. Of course, Scotty, I'd like to show him the ship, just to show him that we're, er, we're on the level. But you know how it is. Scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one of Krako's men. We'll need advisors and troops to back him up on the hit. You got all that, Scotty? You may begin, Mister Scott. Not exactly. Right? It's faster than walking. Are you afraid of cars? Spock, I've got the hang of it. Now go on. Wrong again, Oxmyx. Knock it off, Sawbones. I want to talk to this creep. Now listen, I'm getting tired of playing pattycake with you penny-ante operators. You're a penny-ante operator. Sit down. All right, Spocko, cover him. Now listen, sweetheart. The Federation's moving in, taking over. You play ball, we'll cut you in. You don't, you're out. All the way out. You know what I mean? Kirk to Enterprise. You got Krako on ice? Okay, baby. Cool him till I flag you. Keep him until I send for him. We're going to make some old-style phone calls from this locale. So you locate the man on the other end of the blower and give him a ride to this flop. Find the man at the other end of the phone And transport him to these co-ordinates. Can do, sweetheart? Now you. Get on the blower and call the other bosses. Get with it. I'm giving the orders here. Scotty? Lock in and energise. Yeah. All right! All right! All right! All right! Now the Federation's taking over whether you like it or not. You people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory. From now on, it's going to be under one roof. You're going to run it like a business. That means you're going to make a profit. I'm cutting the Federation in for forty percent. You got any objections? Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. Quiet! Just a moment! There are over four hundred guys there. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Get that heater down. Don't you want to take a look at what you're going to fight? All right, but at least let me call my ship one last time and say goodbye. Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk. Scotty, put the ship's phasers on stun. Fire a burst in a one-block radius around these co-ordinates. They're not dead, just knocked out for a while. But they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to. I was talking about both. Hey, Bela, no, no, no. The Federation can't get connected with a small-time operation like this. No, I was thinking, Bela, you would be the top boss. Krako, you'd be his lieutenant. The rest of you, I don't want any trouble from the rest of you because you'll have to answer to the Federation. We'll be back every year to collect our cut. Yeah, I think forty percent's sufficient. It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx. Let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate. Gentlemen, you two have been brooding ever since we returned to the ship. Brooding, Mister Spock. A sombre, emotional state. Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it? Ah, yes. I understand that. You don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge. Yes, that's a very good question, Mister Spock. I propose our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the Iotians into a more ethical system. Despite themselves, they'll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities. Isn't that logical? All right, Bones, in the language of the planet, what's your beef? Go ahead. Tell me. You left it? You're not certain of what? In Bela's office? They will, they will. And they'll find out how the transtator works. Everything. Serious? Serious, Bones? It upsets the whole percentage. Well, in a few years, the Iotians may demand a piece of our action. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Well, there's an intersection just at the end of the block, near a yellow fire plug. Think you can find it? Fine. Fine. I'll have a reception committee there to meet you. Hit that button. Yeah? All right. Bring them in. Which one of you is the captain? Make yourself a drink, Captain. It's good stuff. I distill it myself. That's me, pal. Doctor, huh? Put that chopper down, Kalo. These guys are our guests. Pick up a cue, Captain. Go ahead. You can't be too careful around here these days. The boss of my territory. I got the biggest in the world. You know, there's one thing wrong with having the biggest. There's always some punk trying to cut you out. That's why you can't be too careful. What government? Look, I told you. I got the territory and I run it. That's all. Yeah, sure. Maybe a dozen or so, not counting the small fry, but then they get burned anyway soon as I get around to it. How do you know about Krako? Okay. You hit him back, you hear? Hard. Hey, wait a minute. That's the Book. The Book. They left it, the other ship. The Horizon. I don't want any more cracks about the Book. Sure. Some text books on how to make radio sets and stuff like that, but, look, I brought you here so you could help me, not for you to ask me questions. After that, I'll answer anything you want to know. Well, I was thinking. You Feds must have made a lot of improvements since that other ship came here. You probably got all kinds of fancy heaters up there. So here's the deal. You give me all the heaters I need. Enough tools so I can knock off those punks all at once. Then I'll take over, and all you'll have to do is deal with me. What aggression? I got to make hits. I want you to help me hit them. That's all. I ain't interested in your orders. From now on, you're gonna take orders from me. I'm gonna give you just eight hours to give me the things I want. If I don't have those tools by then, I'm gonna call up your ship and have them pick you up in a box. Is that understood, pal? Let's see how this thing works. That good, huh? All you have to do is give me about a hundred of these fancy heaters and we'll have no more trouble. Captain Kirk, I usually get what I want. What's this thing? All right. Burn him. How does it work? Kalo, take them to the warehouse and put them in a bag. Keep a sharp eye on them, you hear. Hey, you. In the ship up there. Hey, you in the ship. This is Bela Oxmyx. I got your captain and his friends down here. You want to see them alive Again you'll send me down a hundred of these fancy heaters you've got, and some troops to show me how to use them. You heard right, pal. I'm going to give you just eight hours to get me the goods I want, or I put the hit on your friends. You understand? Huh? Hey, how'd you get back up there? Oh, yeah. I tell you, you'd better come on back down. Krako's put the bag on your captain. Kidnapped him, you dope. He'll scrag him, too. Look, you guys got something I want. I can help you get your captain back. Then we can talk about the deal I want. What's to trust? Business is business. We'll call a truce. You come on down. My boys'll spring Kirk, and then we'll talk about giving me a hand. I'm a businessman, pally. What do ya say? You know what to do. Just the same, you be careful. They'll have heaters on them. Now you watch this. Ship's log. Mister Spock reporting. Incredible as it seems, Doctor McCoy and I are once again prisoners of the chief criminal boss of a society patterned after old Earth gangsters. Pick up many more of these, I won't need your co-operation. I was hoping you'd think that, dummy. Nobody helps nobody but himself. Huh? Yeah, but I got to be the unity. The most co-operative man in this world is a dead man. And if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to be co-operatin'. Hey, Captain, you got away from Krako. You know, that ain't easy. Knowing Krako, he'll probably send them back on a blotter. What do you mean, penny-ante operator? Yeah, sure. Why didn't you say so in the first place? All you had to do was explain it to me. I sure don't know what you think you're talking about. Hello. Hello? Guess who? Yeah, you bet your life I've got a lot of nerve. What are you going to do about it? Hey, Captain, that ain't bad. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Tepo's got a point. All we ever seen is them. My boys will put you down. Hey, that's great, Krako. Now we got hostages again. We can make a deal with the Feds up there. Hey, did you see that? Okay, okay, Kirk, so we get the message. Now, what was this syndicate deal you were talking about? Okay. A syndicate makes sense to me. I'm a peaceful man at heart, but I'm sick and tired of all these hits. I hit Krako, Krako hits Tepo, Tepo hits me. There's too many bosses. We can't get anything done. I was thinking if there was just one, maybe somebody like you, as the top boss, then we can get things done. It's reasonable. It sounds reasonable. That sound reasonable to you?"
629,TOS,episode 46,ZABO,"Hold it! Okay, pally, we're going for a ride. Listen, pally, this could either be a taxi or a hearse. You know what I mean? Sharp, Boss. Oh, not again. Hey, wake up. You all right? Hey, you guys. Come in here. The Feds snatched Krako. I never seen anything like it. They're going to move in unless we stop 'em now. Well, Bela's mixed up in this somehow. I've got a sneaking hunch they're going to high-tail it back to his territory. You know what we're going to do? We're going to hit his place. All right. You know what to do. We hit Bela's place and nobody comes out alive. All right. Let's go."
630,TOS,episode 46,KALO,"Okay, you three, let's see you petrify. I want to see you turn to stone. Put your hands over your head, or you ain't going to have no head to put your hands over. What's this? A heater, huh? Hey, the boss will love that. I know what he said, bud. He said some of the boys would meet you. Okay, we're meeting you. You trying to make trouble? Don't give me those baby blue eyes. I don't go for that innocent routine. I never heard such stupid questions in my life. All right. Get moving. Down the street. Krako's getting more gall all the time . It happens, pal. Yeah? We ain't playing for peanuts. What's the matter, you guys never saw a hit before? Ask the boss. I don't know nothing. Get moving. Write him a letter. 2 Get lost, will ya? Some people got nothing to do but complain. They pay their percentages and the boss takes care of them. Got them, Boss. No sweat. He hit us, Boss. I'll take care of it. Hey, Boss, this here's a heater, and I don't know what this is. In the bag, Boss. Come on. You think so, huh? Who's asking you? Listen, Kirk, I can play anything you can figure out. Take the cards, big man. Show us how it's played. Fizzbin? On the right. On Tuesday. I need another jack. A sralk? Except at night. If it were dark on Tuesday. What? I'll get it. Don't worry, Boss. They can't do nothing till they're through sparkling. Now just a minute."
631,TOS,episode 46,KRAKO,"So you're the Fed, huh? Well, well, well, well, well. Krako. JoJo Krako. I'm the head of the whole Southside Territory. Hey, glad to see you. Sit down, Kirk. I've got all of Bela's communications bugged. He can't make a date with a broad unless I know about it. Well, I guess you want to know why I brought you here. Hey, I like that. That is sharp. That's sharp, eh, Zabo? That's right, a deal. I want you to help me. Wrong! I know Bela. He didn't offer you beans. Now, me, I'm a reasonable man. You give me what I want and I'll cut you in for, say, a third. Skimmed right off the top. Well, what do you think? You watch it, Kirk. The Book tells us how to handle things. You make hits. Somebody argues, you lean on 'em. What do you think, we're stupid or something? I haven't been arrested in my whole life! Listen, pally, I know how to get what I want. You want to live, don't you, Kirk? You bet you do. But after I get through with you, you're liable to be sorry unless you come across. Hold him here. Tell Cirl the Knife to sharpen up his blade. I just might have a job for him. Unless you come across with the heaters. That's too bad. Put him on ice! Well, ain't this nice? I was wondering how I was going to get you back, and here you deliver yourself! Who's your friend with the ears, Kirk? I ain't, pally. Put down your heaters. So this is the fancy heater, huh? How does it work? The only thing I want you to tell me is how it works. Of course I can! I either trust 'em, or they're dead. Let's go in here and talk about it. Now we got no busy little eyes to worry about. How does this thing work? Toys? How much is that? I thought you guys had laws. No interference. What's your cut? All right, it's a deal. Call your ship. Bring down your boys and whatever else you need. You mean you're going to start sending down your boys now? How the hell'd I get here? What? What happened? You. You must be that Scott fellow Kirk was talking to. I want to know what happened. I got rights. You mean cement overshoes? Listen. They got a ship. I know. I was there. I'm not going to believe my eyes. Let me say something. I only saw three guys in that ship. Maybe there ain't no more. That's your story, buster. Hey, it's my boys. They're making a hit at this place. Want to bet? Keep moving. One move out of you two, I'll drill them. Give me the hardware. Are you kidding? This one's all mine. From now on, nobody's going no place. I'm going to be the big boss in this here territory. I already seen it. You're nothing, Fed. Well, all right. Go ahead. Don't get smart. Gee, that's some trick."
632,TOS,episode 46,TEPO,"Coming over with my boys and we Mother. And what's your percentage? Yeah! I hear a lot of talk, but all I see here is you and a couple of your boys. I don't see no Federation. What, a couple of boys? He was talking about a percentage. Look, you figure maybe forty percent's enough?"

647,TOS,episode 47,SPOCK,"Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector. Captain, the Intrepid. It just died. And the four hundred Vulcans aboard, all dead. Doctor, I know what I know. Captain. Yes, sir. I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was momentary. It passed quickly. I sensed it die. Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us. Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known. I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room there seems to be in yours. It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody. Indications of energy turbulence ahead. Unable to analyse. I've never encountered readings like this before. I would assume that. Not very likely, Ensign. Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to the computers now. Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A system. I have none, Captain. Insufficient data. Lieutenant. No analysis due to insufficient information. I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon. It is beyond our experience, and the new information is not yet significant. It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot see through it. It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of energy, but nothing our sensors can identify. Very possible. Captain? Analysing now, Captain. Negative, Captain. All systems functioning properly. Unknown, Captain. That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a boundary layer, Captain. Unknown. Between where we were and where we are. It would never occur to me, Captain. We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes. As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we grow weaker. Bridge to Captain Kirk. Sir, we are accelerating. We are being pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness. Unknown, Captain. I suggest you order Mister Scott to give us reverse power. In that case, Captain, I would suggest we apply forward thrust. It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced. Whatever it is, it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the energy out of an entire solar system and the Intrepid. I would say not, Captain. The analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is not the source of the power drain. I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would be extraneous. It would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time. Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and yet they were destroyed. True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them. Their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being killed. Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory. The memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror. I knew the ship was lost because I sensed it. The touch of death. Astonishment. I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found us. Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely the source of the energy drain. Probe will impact in seven point three seconds. Readings coming in now, Captain. Length, approximately eleven thousand miles. Width varying from two thousand to three thousand miles. Outer layer studded with space debris and waste. Interior consists of protoplasm, varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a semi-fluid central mass. Condition, living. That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death. Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus. The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy, still hungry. We are not safe, Captain. We merely have a little more time than the Intrepid did. I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes into it. They have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it, hoping to kill it. The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered. The lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction. You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies you. The Vulcans saw it first and died. I am more capable. Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a science specialist. We don't have one day, Doctor. We have precisely one hour and thirty five minutes of power left. Captain, I Do not suffer so, Doctor. This is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials. I am familiar with the equipment, Doctor. We're wasting time. The shuttlecraft is ready. This is not a competition, Doctor. Whether you understand it or not, grant me my own kind of dignity. Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Power drain is enormous and growing worse. Diverting all secondary power to the shields. I'll continue communications as long as there is power to transmit. I heard, Captain. We discussed that possibility earlier. But you will need this information. Slowing now. Contact in eighteen point three seconds. Brace yourselves. The area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive. Contact In six seconds. I am undamaged, Captain. Relay to Mister Scott I had three percent power reserve before the shields stabilised. There was nothing to spare. I shall continue my tests. Oh, and Doctor McCoy. You would have not survived it. I am moving slowly now, establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus. Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes. However, I am able to identify the chromosome structure. Changes indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence. I'm having difficulty maintaining ship control. I'm losing voice contact I will transmit internal co-ordinates of chromosome bodies. This is Spock. I am slowly losing life support and minimal shield energies. According to my calculations The nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer protective membrane. Relatively insensitive to interior irritation. I believe sufficient charge of could destroy the organism. Tell Doctor McCoy he should have wished me luck. Captain's log stardate 4309.4. We have determined we can destroy the creature, provided we can do it from inside the organism. Spock clearly knew how to destroy it but was unable to transmit that information. Personal log, Commander Spock, Enterprise. I have noted the passage of the Enterprise on its way to whatever awaits it. If this record should survive me, I wish it known that I bequeath my highest commendation and testimonial to the captain, officers, and crew of the Enterprise. The finest starship in the fleet. Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt. Do not risk the ship further on my behalf. Why, thank you, Captain McCoy. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Request permission to come aboard. Obviously, Captain. And I have some fascinating data on the organism."

All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust these crazy Vulcan readings. Spock, how can you be so sure the lntrepid was destroyed? But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject before Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die. But four hundred Vulcans? Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish that on us, would you? Sickbay to Captain Kirk. McCoy here. I'm getting reports from every deck. Half the people on this ship just fainted. Not unless she's feeling ill. I've got an emergency here. There's nothing organic. They all seem to be nervous, weak, and irritable. They say it happened suddenly, like a balloon popping. I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet. Yeah, we can handle it, Jim. McCoy here. Worse. They're backed up into the corridor. On my way. McCoy out. A stimulant. Two thirds of the personnel are affected. No. You know you'll get everything I can tell you. But when there is nothing, what should I say? Nurse. I have one. I recommend survival. Let's get out of here. Sickbay to Captain Kirk. Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels According to the life monitors, we're dying. We're all dying. Captain's log, stardate 4308.8. It is now ten minutes since we entered the zone of darkness. We have stopped engines while we seek a defence against the energy drain which seems to pervade the zone. Stimulants. I don't know how long we can keep this up. But at a dangerously low level. Well, we're still alive. I suppose that's something. All I can contribute is the further we travel into this zone of darkness, the weaker our life functions become, and I have no idea why. I'm all right. It's those stimulants. They catch up with you. That is an amoeba. Yes, for lack of a better term. It's a very simple form of life. In fact it's a much simpler form of life than what you're looking at now. But that thing can apparently perform all the functions that qualify it as a living organism. It can reproduce, it can breathe, it can eat, although I don't know what. It's one of the things we've got to find out. We've got to take a closer look at it. Perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft. Perhaps with a protective shield We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots. Who said anything about an order, Jim? You've got a volunteer. I've done the preliminary work. All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots. Do you think I intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory since Just because the Vulcans failed You don't think you're going? Jim, that organism contains chemical processes we've never seen before and may never see again. We could learn more in one day Jim Right. I'll get a few things I need, Jim. Nothing has been proven yet, Spock. The code analyser will give you the fundamental structure of the thing. You'll need readings on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder. You're determined not to let me share in this, aren't you? Vulcan dignity? How can I grant you what I don't understand? Good luck, Spock. You want to bet? Well, all I know is, that soon there'll be two, four, eight, and more. The entire anti-life matter that that thing puts out could someday encompass the entire galaxy. How do you feel? Spock. Is it me, Jim? Am I so sentimental that I just have to keep believing that he's still alive in that mass of protoplasm? It's a disease, like a virus invading the body of our galaxy. Millions. Now, isn't that a thought? Here we are, antibodies of our own galaxy, attacking an invading germ. It would be ironic indeed if that were our sole destiny, wouldn't it? Technically, no. Medically, yes. Between the stimulants and the pressure, I would suggest you try to stay off your feet for a few minutes. We couldn't use it. We'd cook ourselves along with that mess of protoplasm out there What? How close are you going to it? Why? The probe has a range of How long do you think you can keep taking that stuff? It'll blow you apart. Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive. Spock? Shut up, Spock! We're rescuing you. Don't be so smart, Spock. You botched the acetylcholine test."

I'm not sure. I was trying to recalibrate, and we went into reverse. I don't know, sir. All I know is that the power levels are down twelve percent and steadily decreasing. I've never experienced anything like it. I don't know, sir. It goes against the rules of logic. But That's doing it, sir. We're slowing down. But we're not stopping. We're still being dragged forward. As to the power levels are concerned, everything is acting backwards, but the drain is continuing. On the static test, I could only get sixty percent power. We're still being dragged forward. But what? Aye, Captain, but I'll reserve some for the shields in case we don't get out. That ought to do it. Engineering to Captain Kirk. Ready to try it when you are, sir. I hope so, Captain. It's no good, sir. The best we can do is to maintain thrust against the pull and hold our position. Aye, sir. At this rate, plus the drain on all systems, two hours. Engineering to Captain Kirk. You asked me to keep you informed on the power drain. All levels are down fifty percent now And still draining. We can maintain thrust for another hour and fifteen minutes. Sir? All systems clear for shuttlecraft launch. sir. Captain, h e won't have enough power to get back out if he diverts it to his shields. Captain, the pull from that organism is increasing, and the power drain from our shields is getting critical. No more than an hour now, sir. Aye, sir. Scott here, sir. We're down to forty three percent, sir. We're slipping a bit against the pull that beastie's putting on us. We can't last more than forty five minutes at this rate of decline. Less, if I have to apply more thrust. Cut the engine thrust? We'd be sucked into that thing like being caught in a wind tunnel, sir. Switching power to shields. Impulse in reserve. Cutting thrust to zero, now! Captain, we've only twenty six percent power reserves after entry. I saved all I could, sir, but I don't know whether we have enough to get back out again. Or time either. Aye, we are, but we're committed to what? We have no power for the phasers. Then what the devil, begging your pardon sir, are we doing? We can't use the power to destroy it. Aye, it couldn't swallow that. It's on its way, sir. Six, maybe seven minutes, sir. Aye, sir. Captain, we don't have enough time to do it. We only have a fifty three second escape margin. Aye, sir. Tractor beams on. Aye, sir. I can't guarantee it'll hold when the warhead explodes. The power levels are The power levels are dead, sir. Power's coming back, sir.

There must be another starship in that sector. Order acknowledged. Kirk out. Mister Kyle, you heard the order. Set course for Gamma Seven-A, warp five. Dead? It's a fourth magnitude sun. There are billions of inhabitants there. Spock, you may have been right. We've lost contact with the Intrepid and we're out of communication with an entire solar system. Any update from Starfleet? Slow to warp three. Scanners on. Magnification three on the screen. What is that? No. You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud. Looks like a hole in space. Readings, Mister Spock. Hold present course. Slow to warp one. Mister Chekov, prepare to launch a telemetry probe into that zone. Direct computer feed to Mister Spock. Launch probe. What was that? Speculation, Spock. Kirk here. What is it? Uhura almost did. She says she's all right. Do you want to see her? What's wrong? Can you handle it, Bones? Good. Kirk out. Hold our position, Mister Kyle. Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead. No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it. Insufficient data is not sufficient, Mister Spock. You're the science officer. You're supposed to have sufficient data all the time. I don't know about you but I'm tired. If you can't tell me what it is, let's use reverse logic. Perhaps it'll help if you tell me what it isn't. So far that's not much help. Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the Intrepid? Lieutenant. Notify the Starfleet that we're going to attempt to probe the area of darkness to gain further information. I'm all right. Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle? Ahead slow. Impulse power only. Very good. Time, Mister Chekov? Red Alert. Deflectors full power. Phaser banks ready. Spock! Malfunction, Mister Spock? Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars. Kirk to McCoy. Things any better down there? Have you got anything that will help up here? I don't want anybody folding on the bridge at a critical moment. Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, there was a power loss. How come? Can you compensate for the loss? I am asking how, mister. I want answers. Kirk out. What's that? Bones, how bad is it? Why? How? Do you have any answers? This ship is in trouble. We'd better start solving problems faster than we pick up new ones. We seem to be in the middle of a creeping paralysis. Mister Spock, analysis of that last burst of noise before we started losing power. What boundary layer? Boundary layer between what and what? Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock? Do you have any ideas, Spock? Recommendations. This is the Captain. We're on a difficult mission, but it's not the first time. Our orders do not say stay alive or retreat. Our mission is to investigate. We're sick, and we're getting sicker. We have no guarantees, but we have a good ship and the best crew in Starfleet. So do your jobs. Carry on. Kirk out. Kirk here. Go ahead, Bones. Yes, say it, Bones. Are you all right? What was that? Reverse? But that was a forward lurch. How could that happen in reverse thrust? Kirk here. By what, Spock? He just gave us reverse power. We lurched forward. What do you think, Scotty? Forward thrust? Yes, doesn't it? Well, if it doesn't work, I'll never let Spock live it down. Notch it into forward. Go ahead. Have one of your engineers monitor the instruments. Keep applying thrust against the pull. Engineering. Spock. The same thing, not the zone itself? Maybe it's a shield of some kind. Some form of protection for something else. We'll find out what it is, but we'd better get out of here ourselves. Scotty, channel all the impulse and warp power into one massive thrust forward. That might snap us out of the zone. Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty. Report to your stations, continue your research. Dismissed. Well, they may not have done all of these things. You just pointed out how illogical this situation is. Explain. What was it you sensed? And what do you think they felt? Kirk here. What is it, Scotty? Do we have the power to pull it off, Scotty? Stand by. All hands, this is the captain. We are slowly being pulled deeper into the zone of darkness by an unknown force. We're going to apply All available power Into one giant forward thrust In the hope that it will yank us out of the zone. Prepare yourselves. All right, Scotty. Let's get on with it. Scotty! Are we still losing power? How long will the power hold out? Maintain thrust, Scotty. While we're maintaining our distance, Mister Spock, have you ascertained yet what we're maintaining our distance from? Prepare to launch a probe, Mister Chekov. Launch probe. Are we still in contact with the probe? Magnification four. Yes, I remember my basic biology, Doctor. You mean to tell me that that thing is a giant single-celled animal? The Intrepid died of that particular virus. How is it we survived? What about this zone of darkness? Does the organism generate it itself as a form of protection? The closer we get, the faster our energy drains out. We're barely surviving at this distance. I'm not sending anyone anywhere. Unmanned probes can give us the information we need to destroy this thing, if it can be destroyed. DO you know what the odds are in coming back? I can't order a man to do that. It's a suicide mission. Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers. I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are. Gentlemen, I'll decide. Captain's personal log, stardate 4309.2. We have established that the thing which destroyed the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven=A system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life. Both Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy have volunteered to go in a specially equipped shuttlecraft to penetrate the cell, find a way to destroy it, and free the ship. Doctor McCoy has the medical-biological knowledge. Mister Spock is better suited physically and emotionally to stand the stress. Both are right, both are capable, and which of my friends do I condemn to death? This is the captain. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, report to my quarters immediately. Kirk out. Kirk here. Very well. Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching. Doctor McCoy will tell you what special equipment to put in. Kirk out. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. Not you, Bones. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. You're best qualified to go. Launch shuttlecraft. Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the computers. Come in, Spock. Chekov. Spock. When do you estimate penetration? Report, Mister Spock. Spock, report. Spock, save your power for the shields. You mean there'll be two of those things? Spock, do you read me? Spock, do you read me? Spock, come in. Come in. He's alive! He's kicked it in the side to let us know. Mister Chekov, telemetry analysis as it comes in. If the energy of that organism only doubles, we're dead, and everything within a light year will be defenceless. Spock understood when he transmitted the co-ordinates of the chromosomes. We must destroy that organism. How much time do we have? Put all secondary systems on standby. Shield power has unconditional priority. Put it on, Lieutenant. What's on your mind? He knew the odds when he went out there, just as you did when you volunteered to go. What is that thing out there, Bones? It's not intelligent. Not yet. Yes, it is, isn't it? How many cells does the human body have? This thing, this cell, this virus. It's eleven thousand miles long, and it's one cell. When it grows into millions, we'll be the virus invading its body. Antibodies. Antibodies. Bridge. Scotty, how much power do we have left? What would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the shields, except for impulse power, keep that in reserve? Exactly. Prepare to divert power on my signal. Kirk out. Have you got something to say? I don't have a few minutes, Bones. Maybe none of us do. Let's go. All hands, this is the captain. We're going to enter the body of the organism rather abruptly, I would think. Damage control parties stand by. All decks secure for collision. Kirk out. Ready, Scotty. I believe everybody is aware of that, Mister Chekov. Very good, Lieutenant. Do we have impulse power, Scotty? We are committed. That thing would probably like phasers. It eats power. Mister Spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice contact. Anti-power. This thing has a negative energy charge. Everything seems to work in reverse. We'll use anti-matter. Mister Chekov, prepare a probe. Scotty, we'll need a magnetic bottle for the charge. How soon? Mister Chekov, we'll use a timing detonator for the probe. Work out a setting. Helmsman, when do you estimate arrival at nucleus? Point blank range. We'll implant it then back away. With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could drift thousands of kilometres. We must be exactly on target, because we won't have a second chance. Bones, time for another stimulant. Keep me together for another seven minutes. That's all I need. We have arrived at the chromosome body in the nucleus of the organism. If we should fail in our attempt to destroy it, or be unable to free ourselves, I wish to record my recommendations for the following personnel, that they receive special citation. Lieutenant Commander Leonard McCoy, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, officers Chekov, Kyle, Uhura, and my highest commendation for Commander Spock, Science Officer, who gave his life in the performance of his duty. Mister Scott, how much time do we have left at one hundred percent impulse power? Mister Kyle, programme fuse for seven minute delay. All non-essential systems on standby. Communications, scanning, conserve every bit of power. We must make it through the membrane before that thing explodes. Make it work, Scotty. Launch probe at zero acceleration. Forward thrust off, one tenth of a second. Mister Kyle, back us out the way we came in. Mister Chekov, a nice, straight line. Don't waste any time. Very good. Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel. Highest possible gain. Spock, do you read me? Do you read me, Spock, do you read me? Come in, Spock. Spock! Scotty, get a tractor beam. I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. Get two tractor beams on that shuttlecraft. Time until explosion? Maintaining tractor beams on shuttlecraft, Mister Scott? You may have just written our epitaph, Mister Scott. Activate main viewing screen. Mister Chekov, report. Shuttlecraft? Spock, you're alive! Later, later, later. Bring the shuttlecraft aboard, Mister Scott. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Starbase Six. Ahead warp factor five. I'm still looking forward to a nice period of rest and relaxation on some lovely planet. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but Want to think about it again, Jim? Starfleet's orders about this planet state no interference with I read it. Inhabitants superior in many ways to humans. Left alone, they undoubtedly someday will develop a remarkably advanced and peaceful culture. Do I have a choice? Enterprise, McCoy. Emergency. Come in. Enterprise, come in. McCoy! Emergency! Jim, there is no antitoxin for this poison. I can only keep you alive a few hours with this. Are you hill people? Do you know a hunter named Tyree? A mugato attacked him. He's James Kirk. He's a friend of Tyree's. Blast it! Do something! He's dying! {Tyree's camp]YUTAN Medical log, stardate 4211.8. Kirk is right about the people here. Despite their fear and our strangeness, they're compassionate and gentle. I've learned the hunter Tyree is now their leader. He is expected to return shortly with his wife, who they say knows how to cure this poison. My problem. The captain is in deep shock. I must keep him warm and alive until then. You and your Garden of Eden. What's that? A plant? It moves. How do you feel, Jim? I want to thank you for saving his life. I would like to learn more about this. He is hers? Jim. Have you seen any strangers among the villagers? Many ways? What else does she know about us? A splendid custom if not carried to extremes. What's bothering you, Jim? If we find the Klingons have helped the villagers, there's certainly something we can do. Jim, this man believes in the same thing we believe in. That killing is stupid and useless. Jim. Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder. This pig iron is almost carbon-free. That village furnace certainly didn't produce it. People's exhibit number two. Cold-rolled gun barrel rod fashioned to look homemade. You were right about the Klingons, Jim. Right. It's a pity we can't include a live Klingon. That'd just about wrap it Jim, I want to talk to you. Do I have to say it? It's not bad enough there's one serpent in Eden teaching one side about gun powder. You want to make sure they all know about it! Have you gone out of your mind? Yes, maybe you have. Tyree's wife, she said there was something in that root. She said now you can refuse her nothing. Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants? Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war that may never end. It could go on for year after year, massacre after massacre. I don't have a solution. But furnishing them firearms is certainly not the answer. Yes, I remember. It went on bloody year after bloody year. And if the Klingons give their side even more? And what about your friend Tyree? Will he understand this balance of power? Well, Jim, here's another morsel of agony for you. Since Tyree won't fight, he will be one of the first to die. Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick. Where is it? That's a fine thing to leave lying around. Show us where it is. Jim? Jim. Who hit you? She's dead. Here. Well, you got what you wanted. Spock, are you alive? Well, I don't know why I was worried. You can't kill a computer."

On the other hand, a flintlock would be the first firearm the inhabitants would normally develop. And were the Klingons behind it, why didn't they give them breechloaders? Bridge, Scott here.

Entering distant orbit, sir. Approaching rendezvous time. I didn't get that exactly, Captain. A hundred what?"
982,TOS,episode 48,KIRK,"How much longer, McCoy? No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out. Yes, the mugato. No problem, though. Those prints are several days old. They seldom stay in one place. Or so it seemed to the brash young Lieutenant Kirk on his first planet survey. Except these people stayed in their Garden of Eden. Bows and arrows for hunting, but absolutely no fighting among themselves. Remarkably peaceful and tranquil. Villagers with flintlocks? That's impossible. They hadn't progressed nearly that far. One of those men walking into ambush is Tyree. The friend I lived with here. Spock? Your phaser. Beam us up, quickly. Lead projectile. Primitive firearm. Bones, can you save him? Kirk here. On my way. Scotty. Bones? Good. Go to Yellow Alert. Do you think you can keep us out of their sight, Chekov? No point in giving ourselves away, Lieutenant. Not until we find out what's going on. Kirk to Sickbay. So, they've broken the treaty. Research is not the Klingon way. When I left there thirteen years ago, those villagers had barely learned to forge iron. Spock was shot with a flintlock. How many centuries between those two developments? Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott.  I did not invite a debate. I'm sorry. I'm worried about Spock and concerned about what's happened to something I once knew down there. You have the conn, Scotty. I'll be in Sickbay. Then you and I are transporting down. You just indicated you could. There are Klingons here. If their mission is a legitimate research interest in the planet's organic potential, then you're the one man who can tell me. Then I need help. Advice I can trust as much as Spock's. Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are, but if the Klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war. Kirk to Bridge. McCoy and I are transporting back down. Inform ship's stores that we'll need native costumes. I understand. We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule. Kirk out. Captain's log, stardate 4211.4. Keeping our presence here secret is an enormous tactical advantage, therefore I cannot risk contact with Starfleet Command. I must take action on my own judgment. I've elected to violate orders and make contact with planet inhabitants. Perfect. Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away. No interference with normal social development. I'm not only aware of it, it was my survey thirteen years ago that recommended it. Indeed. And I intend to see that they have that chance. You coming with me? Contact ship. Took full poison. Fangs. They left. Out of orbit. Tyree. Some of his men. Cure. Bones. I had the strangest dream. Tired. Very tired. You did a fine job, Bones. I think I'll sleep. Bones. What are you doing here? Tyree. My old friend. What am I doing here? A mugato bite! I remember. I told him to take me to Tyree's camp. I knew you'd find a kahn-ut-tu to cure me. The kahn-ut-tu is the local witch people here. They've studied They've studied the roots and the herbs. Yes, of course. I should've guessed. Congratulations. Tyree, we must talk now. The villagers, their new weapons. I want to hear all about that. We must make plans. You say they make the firesticks themselves? How can you be sure? Can you take us to their village while it's still dark? You've seen how these work. We're simply strangers from I am grateful. We once were as you are, Spears, arrows. There came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed ourselves. We learned from this to make a rule during all our travels, Never to cause the same to happen to other worlds. Just as a man must grow in his own way and in his own time. Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should. But we're wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with the way of a man or another world. That's what's bothering me. The something we may have to do. Tyree, supposing you had to fight? What then? Tyree? The gun. Ammunition. Doctor. Let's take a look inside. Well, here's your forge. People's exhibit number one. A chrome steel drill point. Make recorder and scanner tapes of everything. Bones! Move! Fast! Men, this is the pan. This is the hammer. The hammer striking the pan causes a spark, ignites the powder, and fires the flintlock. Now aim it as I showed you. Hold your breath and squeeze the trigger gently. Well done. Very, very, very good. Not here, Bones. In the cave. Yutan, your turn. Exactly. Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm. Superstition. Is it? She wants superior weapons. That's the one thing neither side can have. Bones. Bones, the normal development of this planet was the status quo between the hill people and the villagers. The Klingons changed that with the flintlocks. If this planet is to develop the way it should, we must equalize both sides again. All right, Doctor! All right. Say I'm wrong. Say I'm drugged. Say the woman drugged me. What is your sober, sensible solution to all this? Bones, do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the Asian continent? Two giant powers involved, much like the Klingons and ourselves. Neither side felt could pull out. What would you have suggested, that one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon? Mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had. No. The only solution is what happened back then. Balance of power. Then we arm our side with exactly that much more. A balance of power. The trickiest, most difficult, dirtiest game of them all, but the only one that preserves both sides. No. Probably not. But I'm going to have to try and make him understand. I never had a more difficult task. Well, war isn't a good life, but it's life. His wife is the only way to reach him. If I tell her we're going to supply guns, maybe she'll convince him. I'd like to talk to you. I would like I feel dizzy. Yes, you are lovely. You're beautiful. Nona. No, no. I'm all right. My phaser. She took it. Tomorrow in the palm of her hands. Not what I wanted, Bones. What had to be. Kirk here. Spock, Captain. I trust all has gone well. Spock, ask Scotty how long it would take him to reproduce a hundred flintlocks. A hundred serpents. Serpents for the Garden of Eden. We're very tired, Mister Spock. Beam us up home. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

1276,TOS,episode 48,TYREE,"Villagers! Nona, enough. In time the villagers will return to their ways of friendship. I took you because you cast a spell upon me. The night of madness. No, Nona. No! It brought up evil beasts from my soul. Nona, where's Kirk? The cave? You must. He is the one I told you of. The friend of my younger days. I gave him my promise of silence. He was made my brother. Nona I am Tyree. It is Kirk. She will cure him. She must sleep also. When a man and woman are joined in this manner, he can refuse her no wish. But it is only legend. Yes, James! James, it's good to see you. My wife, Nona. Much has happened since you left, James. Come, we'll speak of it. Come. We will speak of it. The firesticks first appeared nearly a year ago. Since that time, many of my people have died. I've looked into their village. I have seen it being done. Strangers? No. Yes, but the mugatos travel at night also. You killed one. Its mate will not be far. You will not speak of this to others. No! I said I will not kill! You will help in ways she does not understand. I have faith in our friendship, James. Come, before we lose the darkness. The guard. We must wait. Now. Come. There! I left it there. I do not want it. Nona! 4 I want more of these, Kirk. Many more! Yutan, two of those who killed my wife have escaped. Track them down. I will kill them."
1277,TOS,episode 48,NONA,"We must obtain the same firesticks, husband. You could be killing them instead. We could take their houses, their goods. In time? They kill your people! I am a Kahn-ut-tu woman. In all this land, how many are there? Men seek us because through us they become great leaders. And I have spells that help me keep you. Remember this leaf? The night we camped by the water? Oh, Tyree, did you really hate that madness? Only one lovely beast, Tyree, my huge, angry man. What is it? Strangers? That one. Bring him when his head clears. The stranger, where is he? Tyree, you wish me to save him? My remedies require I know what kind of man he is. All that is known of him. And I am your wife, his sister. I promise silence also. Quickly! Or he dies. And I'm Tyree's woman. A mahko root. For those who know where to find it, how to use it, how to pick it. Take this of my soul. This of my soul. Thine own. Into thine. Deeply. Together. Your pain is mine. All mine. Your soul and mine, together! Return. It is past. Return. Return! Our blood has passed through the mahko root together. Our souls have been together. He is mine now. I am a kahn-ut-tu, Captain. I cured you. Good. It is past time to plan. And of things to be done. I've seen them also, and I know you have many ways to make your friend Tyree a man of great importance. Tyree has told me much of you. Do not blame him. It was the price for saving your life. From one of the lights in the sky, and you have ways as far above firesticks as the sky above our world. I will not if I am made to understand. Teach me. There's an old custom among my people. When a woman saves a man's life, he is grateful. Some men never grow. You must let the villagers destroy us? You will not help your friend and brother kill them instead? We must fight or die! Is dying better? You would let him die when you have weapons to make him powerful and safe? Then he has the wrong friends. And I have the wrong husband. Again. Some find it soothing. Yes. Happy. Yes. You feel good. Kiss me. I bring you victory for Apella! ) 1 Take me to him. He will have the strength to use this new weapon. Touch me again, and this small box will kill you. This weapon I bring you is far greater than your firesticks."
1278,TOS,episode 48,KRELL,"You are late, my friend Apella. Give her to the man who killed the most of her people. The others will see the profit in bravery. I'll make a Klingon of you yet. Your next improvement. Notice what we've done to the striker. See how it holds the priming powder more securely? Fewer misfires. When I return, we will give you other improvements. A rifled barrel. A way to shoot further and straighter. It's quite simple. I'll show you. You will be rich one day, Apella, beyond your dreams. The leader of a whole world. A governor in the Klingon Empire. Guards! Intruders!"
1279,TOS,episode 48,M'BENGA,"Vitalizer B.  Not good, sir. We've no replacements for the damaged organs, sir. If he's going to live, his Vulcan physiology will have to do it for him. Don't let these low panel readings bother you. I've seen this before in Vulcans. It's their way of concentrating all their strength, blood, and antibodies onto the injured organs. A form of self-induced hypnosis. Well, in a sense. He knows we're here and what we're saying, but he can't afford to take his mind from the tissue he's fighting to heal. I suppose he even knows you were holding his hand. Just as they should. This is Doctor M'Benga. There will be someone with you constantly now. When the time comes, I'll be called. As soon as he shows any signs of consciousness, call me immediately. After you've called me, if he speaks, do whatever he says. Yes. That's clear enough, isn't it? Please, release her. As you saw, they must wait until the last possible moment then fight their way back to consciousness."
1280,TOS,episode 48,APELLA,"A quarrel by my people. A division of some skins and a hill woman taken this morning. It's hard to divide one woman. What? Is it difficult to cut grooves into the barrels? I thought my people would grow tired of killing. But you were right. They see that it is easier than trading and it has pleasures. I feel it myself. Like the hunt, but with richer rewards."

We are hundreds of light years past where any Earth ship has ever explored. Class M planet, Captain. With two very important exceptions. It's much older than Earth, and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped away by some sort of cataclysm. The planet has evidently been dead since then. Sensors detect no life of any kind. Captain. Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet. Reading energy only, Captain. No life forms. Coming from deep under the planet's surface, Captain. Under at least one hundred miles of solid rock. Reading a chamber now. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for human life support. Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago. Fascinating. Evidently, Captain. Unlikely. These co-ordinates correspond with the location of the subterranean chamber. I'm sure she did, Captain, Just as you received an order to bring me along. Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles, Doctor. Captain, the security guards. This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago. About the same time the planet surface was destroyed, if our sensor readings are accurate. They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me. Much stronger and harder than anything I've measured before. Sargon, would it harm you if I Pure energy. Matter without form. That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan prehistory. Just a moment, Doctor. And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with your phaser? That is still Jim's body. What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when you wish? Doctor? What is it you want of us? When the struggle came which devastated your planet Fascinating. These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was your task to remain in the receptacle out there Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose? Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds into them, and then return our bodies to us. Captain, do you know what happened? Do you remember any part of it? Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave this planet, travel back with us. With their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years. No, he's not. Hello. Oh, you are a lovely female. A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years. You're welcome. This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the best of the three. Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your human norms. I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race. Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor. It will be unnecessary, Doctor. This Vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism. I'll prepare the formula, Sargon. I can continue in this body for several hours. This woman will assist me. You will take me to your pharmacology laboratory. Now. this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal. While the bodies are occupied, you will administer one injection of ten cc's each hour. This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will code mark for me. This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in his body. No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to administer each of the injections, no one else will notice. What were you saying? Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos. Very good. You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this body. It is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain so that Sargon will die with him. Enterprise Medical Log. Stardate 4769.1. Three alien minds now inhabit the bodies of Captain Kirk, Science Officer Spock, and Doctor Ann Mulhall. In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa. Mechanically efficient and quite human-looking. Android robot hands, of course. Hands without feeling. Enjoy the taste of life while you can. It will have twice the strength and agility of your body, engineer, and will last a thousand years. That is, assuming you'll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it. A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another thousand years. And another, and another. Sargon has closed his mind to a better way. With these bodies. When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again. To feel. To live and feel again, Thalassa. Just think how much we can do for mankind. Are these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this? This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female features and some texturing. You no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman. It is ready, Thalassa. You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer. Sargon would've required that you enter the mechanism immediately. Must I make an example of you, too, Helm? Pain, Captain. And you, my dear? Fortunately, Doctor, I know every thought of every mind around me. See? Take the hypo from him. And inject him with it. Fools. I'll simply transfer to another place, another body. Sargon! No, Sargon, please. Let me. Let me transfer.   It seems, Doctor, the injection was only enough to cause unconsciousness. The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain."

Just how much rock are we going to go through? Miles? Are you joking? No. No, if I'd be useful, as long as you're going down, I might as well take a medical look at whatever this is. The air seems fresh. It must be re-circulated somehow. But you once had a body of some type? Where's our captain? Where's Jim Kirk? I won't go along with this. Back to where you were, Sargon, or whatever you are. Are you aware of what's happening to his body? Heart action doubled, temperature a hundred and four degrees? And destroy them, just as you're burning that one up now. Heartbeat's two hundred and sixty two, Spock. Entire metabolic rate correspondingly high. Is it you, Jim? Good, his metabolic rate is back to normal. He doesn't appear to be harmed. Physically, anyway. That's the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard. An alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into a bottle and And what if we should decide against you? No comment. Quite simple. Happens every day. It all seems rather indecent to me. They're giants, and we're insects beside them. They could destroy us without meaning to. And all he wants is the body of our captain and our second in command, too. Coincidence? What's your attitude on that, Doctor? Then I'll still want one question answered to my satisfaction. Why? Not a list of possible miracles, but a simple basic understandable why that overrides all danger. And let's not kid ourselves that there is no potential danger in this. The extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high, and The body functions will race many times their normal metabolism, so we're going to have to monitor this very carefully. Well, I guess we're as ready as we'll ever be, Jim. Vulcans worship peace above all, Henoch. Nurse! Henoch, you'd better get back to bed too. Sargon, it won't work. You've got to get out before you kill them. A what? It was close, Jim. You both barely got back alive. Unless the formula works, we can't risk it again. As planned, the construction of android robots is underway. All is proceeding as expected and as promised. I can find no reason for concern, but yet I am filled with foreboding. Nurse, how are the last metabolic readings on our patients? Is something wrong, Miss Chapel? Regarding our patients? You look tired, Miss Chapel. Perhaps you'd care for me to administer the last few injections. Sickbay. McCoy. You sound terrible. Wait there for me. Hypo. He's dead. Medical Log. Stardate 4770.3. Do I list one death or two? When Kirk's body died, Sargon was too far distant from his receptacle to transfer back. Sargon is dead. But is Captain Kirk dead? His body is, but his consciousness is still in the receptacle into which it was transferred earlier. Yes, we can keep them going for a few weeks, or a month. For all the good it'll do. Yes? But you said that was impossible. I see. And Henoch intends to keep Spock's body, of course. If you're asking my approval Neither Jim nor I can trade a body we don't own. It happens to belong to a young woman. I will not peddle flesh. I'm a physician. This is Sickbay. Get me Nurse Chapel, what in the devil? Jim? Are you all right? Thalassa? Jim, the receptacles. Spock's consciousness was in one of them. What are you talking about? There is no Spock to return to his body. You've killed a loyal officer, your best friend. Jim. There was enough poison in that hypo to kill ten Vulcans. Sargon."

They Just didn't dematerialise. I don't like it, sir. You're going to what? Are they all right in the head, Doctor? Ach! You're joking. A starship engine the size of a walnut? That's impossible. But I don't suppose there'd be any harm in looking over diagrams on it. For all the good it'll do you. It's a fancy name, but how will something that looks like a drop of jelly make this thing work? You'll need microgears and a pulley that does what a muscle does. I tell you, lady, this thing won't work."
1309,TOS,episode 49,KIRK,"Well? Someone or something has succeeded. Our distress signal relays have been activated. We've been given a direction to follow, but how? What's causing it? Close to Earth conditions. Who are you, Sargon? Is that a request or demand? The planet is dead. There's no possibility of life there as we understand life. Since exploration and contact with alien intelligences is our primary mission, I've decided to risk the potential dangers and resume contact. Log entry out. How long before Starfleet receives that? Got something? Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy report to the transporter room in ten minutes with standard landing party equipment. Spock. And I would like to have my science officer with me on something as unusual as this, but it is full of unknowns and we can't risk both of us being off the ship. On the other hand, perhaps this Sargon would like you to come with us. I see. Will you transport down with us, Mister Spock? Mister Sulu, you have the conn. Easy, Bones. As long as you know there's something down there, you know as much as we do. The rest is only guesses. I have a feeling that they or it could destroy us just standing here if they or it wanted to. Who are you? By whom? Oh, yes. No, we're not. Let's go. Doctor, if you prefer to stay behind? Kirk here. Yes, Scotty, and I shouldn't be able to this deep inside the planet, but perhaps this has been arranged for us, too. Is the security guard up there? No problem yet. Maintain alert. Kirk out. Composition of walls? Is that for us, or does it need fresh air? Impossible. That's twice you've referred to us as my children. A war? Then perhaps your intelligence wasn't so great, Sargon. We faced a similar crisis in our early nuclear age. We found the wisdom not to destroy ourselves. I don't understand. You said you wanted our help. What is it you wish? I am Sargon. He is unharmed. I have taken his body to demonstrate Lungs filled with air again. To see again. Heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again. A half a million years. To be again. Your captain has an excellent body, Doctor McCoy. I compliment you both on the condition in which you maintained it. Have no fear. Your captain is quite unharmed, although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as I do. In the next room, there are other receptacles. The other two of us that survived. You, Doctor Ann Mulhall, and you, Mister Spock, we require your bodies also. We must have Captain Kirk and you so that we may live again. Even for us, a half million years is almost too long to wait. Two others still survive. Henoch and Thalassa. Thalassa, my Thalassa. I am pleased you survived with me. Forgive me. It has been so very long. Only the best minds were chosen to survive. Thalassa, my wife, as you may have guessed. Henoch, from the other side. Realising our mistake, we attempted to perpetuate both sides. We built this chamber here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion. We knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root, that one day you would build vessels as we did, and one day you would come here. and search the heavens with my mind, probing, waiting, probing. And then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here. To steal? To take them from you? No, no, my children, you misunderstand. We mean only that you should lend us your bodies for a short time. I will return your captain to you before the body limit has been reached. To build. To build humanoid robots. We must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands, your fingers. No. Our methods, our skills are far beyond your abilities. It is time. Yes. Sargon borrowed my body. I was floating in time and space. Spock, I remember. When Sargon and I exchanged, as we passed each other, for an instant we were one. I know him now. I know what he is and what he wants, and I don't fear him. Sargon. A simple transference. Their minds and ours. Scotty, I need your approval, too. Since you'll work with them, furnishing them all they need to make the android robots. You won't be working with them, you'll be working with us, our bodies. They'll be inside us, and we'll be Bones, they'll show us medical advances, miracles you never dreamed possible. Scotty, engineering advances. Vessels this size with engines the size of walnuts. They selected us as the most compatible bodies. Bones? You could stop all this by saying no. That's why I called you all here together. We'll all be deeply involved. It must be unanimous. They used to say if man could fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. Do you wish that the first Apollo mission hadn't reached the moon, or that we hadn't gone on to Mars and then to the nearest star? That's like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great-great-great-great-grandfather used to. I'm in command. I could order this. But I'm not because, Doctor McCoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this. But I must point out that the possibilities, the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great. Risk. Risk is our business. That's what the starship is all about. That's why we're aboard her. You may dissent without prejudice. Do I hear a negative vote? Engineer, stand by to beam aboard three receptacles. Ready, Sargon. The transference is complete. Here. In this body. And I too am pleased, beloved. Kiss. We will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic reduction injection. Henoch, your condition? Fortunate. We will vacate at once. Bones, what? I remember. You held my hand like this.   I think it best not to remember so well. Our minds will have survived. And as androids, we can move among the people who do live, teaching them, helping them not to make the errors we did. Nothing. Our next injection will renovate me. Do not be concerned. Sickbay. Sargon here, McCoy. I'm in your deck six briefing room. Nothing of importance. Fatigue perhaps. Yes. I wanted to be certain there was no error. Formula is correct. Don't be concerned. It is an excellent body. There. You see? I feel better already. That will take months, perhaps years. We haven't that choice, Thalassa. No, beloved. If we torment ourselves Our thoughts will intertwine. Yes, I'm fine, Bones. It was necessary. Bones, prepare a hypo. The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans. Spock's consciousness is gone. We must kill his body, the thing in it. Spock. My friend Spock. If there'd only been another way. You're alive. But your vessel was destroyed, too. Where was your consciousness kept? Is there any way we can help you, Sargon? I promise, beloved. Forever beloved. Forever. Well, I'm sure that Sargon appreciated your co-operation, Doctor Mulhall."

I did receive an order to report here for duty. Atmosphere report, Captain. A fraction richer in oxygen than usual for us, but otherwise normal. All readings are off the scale, Captain. Our beliefs and our studies indicate that life on our planet, Earth, evolved independently. Yes, I have the same readings. He'll die if you don't leave his body. Soon! So you could steal our bodies from us? We have engineers, technicians. Why can't they build your robots for you? I'm afraid that I must agree with Doctor McCoy. You could be suffering from a form of false euphoria. I'm not so certain of that, Doctor. It is scientifically fascinating. Well, if we all agree, I'm willing to host Thalassa's mind. I'm a scientist. The opportunity is an extraordinary one for experimentation, observation. I'd forgotten what it felt like even to breathe again. Sargon? I am not displeased, my husband. Your body is not unlike that which was your own. After so long. So very long. Sargon, I remember a day long ago. We sat beside a silver lake. The air was scented with the flowers of our planet. What is it, Sargon? Thank you. Have you prepared the negaton hydracoils for the drawing Sargon supplied? That would be highly inefficient. They're not ours, Henoch. No. I'm beginning to hate it. Sargon, what is it? Henoch's formula. In time, a host body will become accustomed to us, husband. Injections will no longer be necessary. Husband. Feel the touch of my hand, husband. Beloved. What will that word mean to a machine? Will they, husband? Will they intertwine like this? Can two minds press close like this? Can robot lips do this? Sargon, what is it? Doctor, help him! Why pretend to work on that thing, Henoch? You know you never intended to leave Spock's body. No! I cannot live in that thing. Doctor. Would you like to save your Captain Kirk? We have many powers Sargon did not permit us to use. He thought them too tempting to us. This body pleases me. I intend to keep it. Henoch's plans are his own affair. I wish only to exist in peace as a living woman. I require only your silence. Only you and I will know that Doctor Mulhall has not returned to her body. Isn't that worth your captain's life? Doctor, we can take what we wish. Neither you, this ship, nor worlds have the power to stop us. Who you hardly know. Almost a stranger to you. A physician? In contrast to what we are, you are a prancing, savage medicine man. You dare defy one you should be on your knees worshipping? I could destroy you with a single thought.   Stop! Sargon was right. The temptations within a living body are too great. Forgive me. Sargon? Where are you? I thought you destroyed by Henoch. Yes. Yes, I see. I understand. Just as we would have placed our consciousness within robots, Sargon has placed his into your vessel. Doctor, leave us. Sargon has a plan. We have much work to do. She is now with Sargon, Doctor. I'm Ann Mulhall, back in my own body. Oblivion together does not frighten me, beloved. Promise we'll be together. Together forever. Yes. I was happy to co-operate, Captain."
1609,TOS,episode 49,SARGON,"All of your questions will be answered in time, Captain Kirk. KIRK; Are your hailing frequencies open? I am Sargon. It is the energy of my thoughts which has touched your instruments and directed you here. Now with this closer distance I can speak to you at last. Please assume a standard orbit about our planet, Captain. The choice is yours. I read what is in your mind. Words are unnecessary. And I am as dead as my planet. Does that frighten you, James Kirk? For if it does, if you let what is left of me perish, then all of you, my children, all of mankind must perish, too. Captain's Log. Stardate 4768.3. The Enterprise is in orbit above a planet whose surface, our sensors tell us, is devoid of all life, a world destroyed and dead for at least a half million years. Yet from it comes a voice, the energy of pure thought, telling us something has survived here for those thousands of centuries. Your probes have touched me, Mister Spock. I have locked your transporter device on my co-ordinates. Please come to us. Rescue us from oblivion. I will make it possible for your transporter to beam you that deep beneath the surface. Have no fear. Please stand ready. I will operate your controls. Welcome. I am Sargon. You may use your tricorder, Mister Spock. Your readings will show energy but no substance. Sealed in this receptacle is the essence of my mind. A body much as yours, my children, although our minds were infinitely greater. Because it is possible you are our descendants, Captain Kirk. Six thousand centuries ago, our vessels were colonising this galaxy, just as your own starships have now begun to explore that vastness. As you now leave your own seed on distant planets, so we left our seed behind us. Perhaps your own legends of an Adam and an Eve were two of our travellers. In either case, I do not know. It was so long ago, and the records of our travels were lost in the cataclysm which we loosened upon ourselves. A struggle for such goals and the unleashing of such power that you could not comprehend. And we survived our primitive nuclear era, my son. But there comes to all races an ultimate crisis which you have yet to face. One day our minds became so powerful, we dared think of ourselves as gods. I understand, my son. Go to your vessel. All who are involved must agree to this. After all these centuries, we can wait a few more hours. Then you may go as freely as you came. I am pleased, my beloved. It is good you have found the truth yourself. I have power even Henoch does not suspect, beloved. I could not allow your sacrifice of one so close to you. No, Doctor. I allowed you to believe that to be true so that Henoch would read your thoughts and believe it also. But Henoch believed and fled the body. He is destroyed. We now know we cannot permit ourselves to exist in your world, my children. Thalassa and I must now also depart into oblivion. Yes, my son. You can allow Thalassa and me to share your bodies again. A last moment together."

1624,TOS,episode 50,SPOCK,"Passing outer planet, Zeon. I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text he prepared. What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events. Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have. Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a warhead. Fascinating. A thermonuclear warhead. Most interesting. We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile from a planet which should have no such weapon. According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful. Ready, Captain. The Ekosians are humanoid, so there is apt to be a similarity in architecture. Interesting. Captain, the non-interference Directive. Mid-twentieth century Earth. The nation state called Nazi Germany. Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear. Fascinating. You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain? That's very well taken, Captain. Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland? Take charge of him. Your uniform, Captain. Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi. Yes. I shall tend to it, Major. Obviously. Why do the Nazis hate Zeons? Is Zeon a threat to them? It would seem the assumption was premature. That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival. Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard beyond it. To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy. Yes. Of course. The rubindium crystals in the transponders. Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance, which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres. Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately, there. That is, of course, a crude estimation. Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform. Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation, even using crude natural crystals. Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course be very crude. Captain, why should I aim at such a structure? May I remind you, we did not intend to fight. Possibly. I do not see them. Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet. Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators. May I work undisturbed somewhere? By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator. I do not know if the circuits are correct, Captain. There is no way to test it, except in actual use. The one receiving a medal. This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland. We saw her being decorated. That is correct. As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the guards. Captain, I'm beginning to understand why you Earthmen enjoy gambling. No matter how carefully one computes the odds of success, there is still a certain exhilaration in the risk. Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved. Never once looked up. Or a deep psychosis. It may not have the range it had. In fact, it may not work at all. Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. Come in, Enterprise. If there's going to be a delay in transporting the doctor, I suggest we cancel our There is a logical way to proceed, Doctor. Point your toe, apply equal pressure to either side of the boot, and push. We have no time for emotionalism. Yes. A doctor should have more pride. Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us. True. I shall reconsider. Captain, the speech follows no logical pattern. What drug? Captain. I have created a condition in which Gill cannot initiate speech or any other action, but he can reply to questions. Quite correct. For the last few years, the real power has been Melakon. Quite true, Captain. That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt, defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global domination. Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could accomplish its efficiency without sadism. Is he dead, Captain? Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation. Captain, I never will understand humans. How could a man as brilliant, a mind as logical as John Gill's, have made such a fatal error? Thank you, Doctor. I was able to gather the meaning. Yes. Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan. Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power. Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept"

What in blazes is this? He looks drugged, Jim. Almost at a cataleptic state. I have to have a close look at him. Definitely drugged, almost comatose. I can't identify it without a medi-comp. Without knowing, an antidote would be dangerous. I can give him a general stimulant, but it would be risky. I'm working in the dark. I could kill him. The stimulant's working. He's reaching a level of consciousness. It's almost like he's in a light sleep. Now, that's as much as I dare do. He's still alive, but the drug they use is too strong. If I give him another shot I don't dare. What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much power, even with the best intentions, just can't resist the urge to play God. It also proves another Earth saying. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Darn clever, these Earthmen, wouldn't you say? Spock, you obviously don't understand"

We're here to find out what's happened because I don't know. I knew him very well. He was my instructor at the Academy. From Ekos? Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant? Stand by phasers. Range, Mister Chekov? Fire. Maybe they had help. Maximum orbit. Take us out of range of their detection range. Execute. We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance of John Gill. Spock, you and I will beam down. Bones, one precaution. Prepare a subcutaneous transponder in the event we can't use our communicators. Insert the transponders. Make one low pass to communication range in three hours. If we fail to make contact at the appointed time, take our co-ordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what our condition may be. You ready? Energise. Unbelievable. Do you recognise those uniforms? How could this have happened? The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim. You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed, Mister Spock. That's John Gill. The Fuhrer? You're right. He's not one of us. Look at him.   Spock, take his uniform. If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach. That helmet covers a multitude of sins. Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine. Gestapo, I believe. Your orders, Lieutenant. He wants to see your orders in the jacket. The Lieutenant's a little dazed. He captured several Zeons single-handed. One of the pigs struck him before he dropped. I promise you that pig will never get up again. Hail the Fuhrer. This is a day to remember, Major. We have urgent business with the Fuhrer. You're making this a rather one-sided conversation, Major. Let me speak to your Fuhrer. I'll tell him everything he wants to know. I'll explain when I see the Fuhrer. I'll discuss that only with him. John Gill was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. For him to be a Nazi is impossible. Were they like this when you first came? Do you know the plan of this building? If we can get to the SS weapons laboratory, get our weapons back, we might be able to stop the slaughter. We must get our communicators, contact the ship. The transponders. And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mister Spock. I know it's there. McCoy put it in. There. Do you have the figures computed? No, not a radio. The power from this light is very low. I would be honoured, Mister Spock. Oh, Mister Spock, the guard did a professional job on my back. I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry. I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn. Just hurry, please. Never mind, Spock. Just get on with the job. Oh, my goodness. Beautiful. Oh, Spock Spock! Beautiful. Over there. I'll create a commotion. Help! Help! I'll talk! I'll talk! I can't stand it anymore! I'll talk! Guard! Guard, I'll talk! Guard, I'll talk. I'll talk. The pain Take him with us, Mister Spock. He's got a point. He's our guide. Which is the laboratory door? All right, Zeon pigs, move. Zeon pigs. They do nothing right. Don't worry. They're on their way to the laboratory, for experimental work. They'll pay. Move! Move, move. Cover the door.   Here they are. The communicators, disassembled. Can you get one to work? The alien pistols have been sent to Gestapo Command Headquarters. Well, that takes care of the phasers. You Zeons, for peaceful people, are pretty thorough. We came for John Gill. All right, Mister Spock. You've made your point. Get into the uniform and hide those ears again. Hunting's good. We've caught so many Zeons, we've got to dump them outside. I was trying to see the Fuhrer. If I can see him, there may be a way of stopping this insanity. The Enterprise won't be within range for another hour. The girl on the viewscreen. Daras. I must see the Fuhrer. It's urgent. Melakon? How could this have seemed right to John Gill? John Gill, your Fuhrer. He's one of our people. I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock. John Gill, your Fuhrer, was sent here by the Federation as a cultural observer. That was not his mission, ever. He was sent here to observe, not to interfere. Something went wrong, and that's why we're here. To find out and to correct. We must see him. Maximum security. Is he so afraid? I don't understand what's going on here. This goes against every principle that John Gill ever believed in. Our only chance is to see him, and quickly. Will you be there? You must get us in there. Lights. Get me some lights on her. Excuse me. Very good, Spock. We may make a human of you yet. SPOCK; I hope not. Let's go. Lights. Thank you. Where does the Fuhrer enter? They've got the booth curtained off. Bring that light to the side of her face. Where's the entrance to the broadcast booth? We're going to try. Good. We're here to get John Gill, and alive, not for your personal satisfaction. Is that clear? Let's try down there. Lights, please. Gentlemen, this is for the record of the Fuhrer's Final Solution speech. Smile, gentlemen. There will be more coverage later. Thank you very much. Let's get a moving shot down the hall. Yes, well, that may be part of the plan, the semi-divine detachment. It may be simpler than that. He may be drugged. We need McCoy. Is there a place, a room we can be alone for a few minutes? I'm going to send for help. It takes too long to explain. Any place will do. Think positively, Spock. Captain here. Put McCoy on. We've having difficulty. Patch historical computer into uniform section. I want McCoy outfitted as a Gestapo doctor Nazi Germany, old Earth date 1944. Make him a colonel. We found John Gill. At least, we've seen him. He may be drugged, hypnotised, or psychotic. You'll have to make a determination. Hurry with that uniform. What is it? Kirk to Enterprise. What's happening up there? Send him down naked if you have to. Kirk out. This is Doctor McCoy, our Chief Medical Officer. Daras, secretary to the National Socialist Party. The Colonel is drunk. He's had a little too much to drink. Yes, he thought he would embarrass the Fuhrer. Nor do I, but luck is something you also fail to recognise, Mister Spock. Let's go. Watch his mouth. Random sentences strung together. Gentlemen, I want a picture of you two with the Hero of the Fatherland listening to the stirring Fuhrer's speech. Get that light over there, please. Get this light around here. Smile, gentlemen. Turn around, smile, and now. It's locked. Keys. Is there anything you do? Take the risk. Bones, increase the dosage. Spock, try to get through to him with a mind probe. If you can't, Bones, you'll have to use a stronger stimulant, no matter what it does. That would mean the death of thousands of Ekosian spacemen. We could save Zeon, but what about Ekos? Well done, Spock. They've kept what's left of him as a figure head. Gill. Gill, why did you abandon your mission? Why did you interfere with this culture? But why Nazi Germany? You studied history. You knew what the Nazis were. But it was brutal, perverted, had to be destroyed at a terrible cost. Why that example? Why, Gill? Why? Gill. Gill. Gill, can you hear me? You've got to tell those people what happened! You're the only one who can prevent the slaughter! Gill! Bones, give him another shot! We've run out of time, Bones. No, wait. Aim it at Spock. Spock, take off the helmet. She captured a Zeon spy that was attempting to assassinate the Fuhrer. We'll make a present of him to Melakon. Stay close to Spock. Stall for time. And hope. Professor Gill, can you hear me? You've got to speak. You've got to speak. This is our last chance. Gill? Professor. Professor! You've got to talk! You've got to tell them what happened. You've got to come out of it. Come on, Professor. Come on. Come on. You did that, Professor. You told them in time. Dead. So is he. Mister Spock, I think the planet is in good hands. Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us aboard. He drew the wrong conclusion from history. The problem with the Nazis wasn't simply that their leaders were evil, psychotic men. They were, but the main problem, I think, was the leader principle. Gentlemen. Gentlemen, we've just been through one civil war. Let's not start another. Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit. Warp factor two, and hurry. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

1940,TOS,episode 50,ISAK,"Hide! They're right behind me. Hide! Hide! Why did they take you? You're not a Zeon. He certainly is not one. Why do the Nazis treat you as enemies? Why? Because without us to hate, there'd be nothing to hold them together. So the Party has built us into a threat, a disease to be wiped out. Where did you come from? Our warlike period ended dozens of generations ago. We came here. We thought we were civilising the Ekosians. Warlike, yes, but not vicious. That started when the Nazi movement began only a few years ago. When they've destroyed us here, they will attack our planet. They'll use the technology we gave them. The danger is that taking life is so repugnant to our people, I'm afraid we'll go down without a struggle. But after what I saw in the street today, I think I could kill. Why? Why should you be interested in saving Zeons? Are you trying to kill yourselves? What is it you're making, some kind of radio? Take me with you. Give me a chance to fight them. Take me with you, or you'll never find the laboratory. The end of the hall. Who are you people? KIRK; The phasers? Where do you come from? Yes. With this uniform, we can steal a car, get out of the capital. It's all right. They helped me escape from the prison. I owe them my life. Abrom! Abrom, thank God you're well. This is my brother. They were in the prison. Beaten as I was, Abrom. Abrom, I owe them my life. She would've been my wife. If we adopt the ways of the Nazis, we're as bad as the Nazis. Stop, Nazis. After you've killed the last of us off, what do you do, turn the guns against yourselves? Don't shoot. Don't shoot, please. Now, please forgive us, but we had to be absolutely certain. The Gestapo methods are frighteningly efficient. We must be very, very careful in order to survive here. We of the Underground don't know who our leaders are. That way, if we break under pressure, we can only betray a handful of our people. It's impossible. Even if this were another time, it still would be impossible. He sees no one. No one but Melakon. He's under maximum security. There are many of us, both Ekosians and younger Zeons, who would gladly risk our lives to kill him. I'm afraid it will be a formal declaration of war against Zeon. Their Final Solution. Well it's a risk living at all the way things are going. If the Captain believes he has a chance, I'm willing to commit suicide with him. It's even more my fight than yours. Sir, is this light better here? If you distract the guard long enough, I can get a machine gun. It's a small booth, I could shoot through the door. So, what have we accomplished? You should have let me shoot him. The cloakroom? There's no reaction. Whatever you gave him isn't working. Many of my friends are aboard that ship, many of the Underground. Guards. For the second time in one day, Daras is a hero to the Fatherland. Yes, let us make an example of this traitor once and for all. Chairman Eneg, this spy must be taken to Melakon. Eneg is one of us. A spy, Excellency. For so long I've prayed for this. Now I'm sorry. You've given us all a new chance."
1941,TOS,episode 50,YELLOW,"Zeon pig. On your feet, pig. Hold. Your hands above your head, Zeon. Higher. Keep your hands up so you don't touch anything Ekosian. You swine have defiled us for the last time. But that's now ended. Move!"
1942,TOS,episode 50,ABROM,"Isak, what is all this? Why were you in their prison? The Fuhrer? Isak, Uletta is dead. Shot down in the streets. She lived for five hours while they walked past her and spat on her. Our own people were unable to help her. Now you ask me to help strangers. This way. I alone am responsible for what happens here. No, wait. No more. You've proved they're on our side. Yes. If we had taken you into our confidence, we could've betrayed all our people if you'd been Nazi spies. All right, leave us. The Deputy Fuhrer. He's taken over. Who? And what is your people?"
1943,TOS,episode 50,SOLDIER,"You, Zeons! What kind of monsters are the Zeons sending against us? What do you mean?"
1944,TOS,episode 50,DAVOD,Who's with you?
1945,TOS,episode 50,DARAS,"Over there. Against the wall, all of you. Quiet. Hands in the air, Zeon swine. So you're the three who escaped from the Chancellery detention centre. What was your plan? Speak. It's the last chance you'll get. Urgent? I'll bet it is. Do you know what we do to responsible Zeons? Now we finish the job. I'm an Ekosian fighting the terrible thing that's happened to my people. The decoration was for betraying my own father to the Party. It was my father's idea. You see, he used to be very close to the Fuhrer. Then he saw the changes and where they were leading. He turned against the Party. They imprisoned him. Melakon sentenced him to death. My father denounced me, making it appear like I'd betrayed him. He gave me a weapon to continue the fight with. You mean that the Fuhrer is an alien? I grew up to admire him, later to hate and despise everything he stands for. But I always thought he was one of us. Now to hear that he's an alien sent here to destroy us He makes a speech tonight from the Chancellery. All the top Party officials will be there. Of course. As a symbol of the proper attitude toward the Fatherland. Only the top, most trusted, officials will be allowed in. The country will watch on the viewscreens. It would be suicide. You, a Zeon? You expect to get into the Chancellery? The Fuhrer's special documentary corps. Smile, Corporal. He doesn't. They watch him on the big screen. There, at the end of the room. He broadcasts from the booth for security. There, at the end of the corridor. You're not going to try to get into the broadcast booth. We're documenting the men responsible for   Send for? Isak just heard two security men. They picked up your broadcast, pin-pointed it within this building. They're starting to search. It's true. I only half-believed what you said. Chairman Eneg. The Fuhrer's speech. If they find us here, we'll all be killed. It's begun. It's finally begun. There's one chance left. If you'd use the weapons you have, you could destroy the fleet. Yes, but against those thousands are millions of innocent Zeon lives. You've got to choose the lesser of two evils. A rare prize. The Deputy Fuhrer can see this is no ordinary Zeon. The Deputy Fuhrer's an authority on the genetics of racial purity. How would you classify this one? Eneg and I will go on the air, offer a new way for our people. For all our people, both Zeons and Ekosians."
1946,TOS,episode 50,MAJOR,"Lieutenant! Have you forgotten how to salute? Your papers. Good work, Lieutenant. Hail to the Fuhrer. Lieutenant? Better see a doctor. You don't look well. Your colour. Lieutenant! Your helmet. Remove it. Lieutenant, remove your helmet. Enough. do you wish to speak now? Tell me your orders! You were sent to kill our Fuhrer. Confess! Do you want some more persuasion? Do not joke with me, Zeon pig. Who is this alien? Things might go easier if you tell me about him. You'll be glad to talk to me before I'm through. Ah, Chairman Eneg. Your Excellency, I am honoured. I've been interrogating these spies, captured in Pig! You're speaking to the Chairman of the Party. Excellency, give me a few minutes with them. I promise you, I'll have Yes, Excellency. Excellency, the standing order is to interrogate and execute. The interrogation is finished, therefore Excellency, the order Yes, Excellency. All right, pigs. I shall keep my eye on the clock. When the hour is up, you will die most unpleasantly, I promise you! Lock them up."
1947,TOS,episode 50,ENEG,"Major. I've had a full report. You are not from Zeon. Where do you come from? What is your business with the Fuhrer? That's enough, Major. What were the weapons found on you? What design? Our famous SS laboratories have been unable to discover how the weapons work. You've had a few minutes without result. The trouble with you SS is that you don't realise that punishment becomes ineffective after a certain point. Men become insensitive. Lock them up. Let their pain argue with them. Then I will question them. Finished? What have you learned? Hold them for an hour. That is my order, Major. I suggest you do not disobey it. Search the building. I see. You were right to conceal him. There's a spy in this building with a secret transmitter. We're conducting a search. Hail the Fuhrer. Guards. Pass them on my responsibility. Wait, soldier. There's been enough killing. Now we'll start to live the way the Fuhrer meant us to live. Thank you, but go now. We must do the rest. It is time to stop the bloodshed, to bury our dead."

If we fulfill our own greatness, that will all be ended. Working together Will at times be difficult. To reach our goal, And we will reach that goal. must be decisive.

We were betrayed by a self-seeking adventurer who has led us all to the very brink of disaster. I order the immediate recall of the space fleet. This attack must stop. All units are to return to base. To Zeon I promise, this was not an aggression of Ekosian people. Only one evil man. Melakon Is a traitor to his own people and all that we stand for. To the Zeon people, I promise reparation and I was wrong. The non-interference Directive is the only way. We must stop the slaughter. Even historians fail to learn from history. They repeat the same mistakes. Let the killing end. Let"
1949,TOS,episode 50,MELAKON,"Hail the Fuhrer! The Fuhrer has given us our orders, and we pledge him our lives in this sacred task. Death to Zeon! But despite our best efforts, they remain like a cancer, eating away at our state. Ten minutes ago, on our Fuhrer's orders, our troops began their historic mission. In the cities, the eliminations have started. Within an hour, the Zeon blight will forever be removed from Ekos. I now announce the glorious final solution. Our entire solar system will forever be rid of the disease that was Zeon. Our space fleet is on its way toward Zeon, both manned and unmanned weapons. This is the time of destiny. Hail victory! What is this? No, not a Zeon, definitely not. Very difficult. Note the sinister eyes and the malformed ears. Definitely an inferior race. Note the low forehead, denoting stupidity. The dull look of a trapped animal. You may take him now for interrogation, but I want the body saved for the Cultural Museum. He'll make an interesting display. Go to the booth. See to the Fuhrer at once. He's ill. Turn off that camera. I suggest we leave and let our Fuhrer rest."

It is possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded here in a shuttle craft. Confirmed. Interesting. A neural field? What brings you here? Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy? Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure. No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook responses. Most curious. The chances are very much against it. Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what this projector looks like. Possible. I would have to have one to examine. Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped. I shall attempt it. Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry. Yes, quite all right, Doctor. I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've never experienced before. A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and blurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which resemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each limb is capable of performing a different function. Undoubtedly. I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The polarized elements would burn out quickly. A small one. I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health. We find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation. It will take me a moment to prepare. I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in Engineering. Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible. This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine. There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final decision, of course, must be the captain's, but I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative energy. Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain. Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material we cannot breach even with our phasers. Mister Scott and I have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us. The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy. When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans will be stopped here. Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy negative. All instruments off the dials, Captain. We are in contact with the barrier.  Instruments returning to normal, Captain. Life support systems sustaining on emergency. I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we four are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential. Captain? Most curious. The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions. Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and are therefore having human reaction. That seems reasonable. Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable, but an interesting psychological study.  I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other. Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident? You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are. Among humans, I've found the symptoms you're displaying usually indicate jealousy. Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive. You are not jealous? Nor upset? Checkmate. Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy. Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline. Stokaline. Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments. If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge. I left him in the recreation room. No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him. It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. Or perhaps Captain Kirk has more. Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a destiny of your own. A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation proposal."

If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance. Spock, are you sure you're all right? You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch. Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are? Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt themselves to our bodies? Well, that's enough. One wrong move, and they jam all our neural circuits. How? It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's healthy. Jim, his heartbeat really is slow. His pulse is practically non-existent.  He may die. If I can get him up to sickbay, there's a chance he'll live. Prepare two ccs of stokaline. Don't argue, nurse. Just get it. This may be the turning point. Prepare another shot. Please, nurse, just follow orders, will you? There, that should do it. Just let him rest now. You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba Fever. He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then. There's no danger if he gets medication in time. He'll be all right in a couple of hours. We're just going to jam it. Scotty tells me you could've destroyed the ship in the barrier. Why didn't you? But that was our only chance to stop them Jim Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those little Before you condemn it, why not try it? All right, I'll show you how to work the selector. I'm delighted. If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet. I don't know about that. Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic. Comes from taking food in pills instead of solid sustenance. I'm going to give you a shot. High-potency vitamin concentrate. You'll need three a day for a few days. And eat some solid food, will you? Well, now, let's see. You've had three shots. I think you better stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you're responding. We haven't seen Tomar either. But my man Hanar is getting more irritable by the minute. I'm giving him shots of formazine. That should have him climbing the walls. Hmm? Oh. You will pardon us. Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice."

You have a very strange sense of humour, Mister Stay there. It's all right. What do you want? Voyage? Where? Andromeda? Why? Well, sorry. This galaxy is already occupied. What's the point of capturing my ship? Even at maximum warp, the Enterprise couldn't get to Andromeda galaxy for thousands of years. What happened to your ship? Yes, I know. We've been there. Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force. Let's take your problem to the Federation. Research expeditions have catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for colonization. The Federation has handled foreign invasions before. All right. We can't break out. There must be another way. That's a very good question. Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life forms in another galaxy? They have the paralysis field. Rojan mentioned something about a central projector. Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field. You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders. On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan mind probe. Do you think you can do it again? Are you all right? I'm responsible. Let them go. What was it? Perhaps practicality. They chose the Enterprise as the best vessel for the trip. Immense beings with a hundred tentacles would have difficulty with the turbolift. We've got to stop them. We outnumber them. Their only hold on us is the paralysis field. Jam. Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis projector? Is there a chance at all? We'll take it. You and Bones have to get to the ship. Yes. Mister Spock, you're sick. No, you're not. Doctor McCoy has given you an thorough examination, and you're ill. In fact, if you don't get to the sickbay, you're going to die. Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance, complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body. Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half an hour? Go ahead. Hanar? Hanar. Mister Spock is ill. The doctor thinks he may be dying. He's a Vulcan. They don't react like humans.  Do what you can with him, Bones. What do you want from me now? My duty is to stop you in any way I can. Or you will kill more of my people? Flowers. I don't know the variety. A rose by any other name. A quote from a great human poet, Shakespeare. That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Increase speed to warp eleven, Mister Chekov. Rojan, I'm going to sickbay. My first officer was taken ill. Anything? Well? What alternative? What? Are you mad? I can't just Reading, Spock. Hold your position. Thank you. So are yours. What neutralising operation? No! Is this all? I couldn't. I didn't think it was. Bones, that's enough! They've reduced the whole crew! It's your idea, Doctor. Go ahead. Even if we could, it's out of the question. We need that projector to bring our people back to human form. What is? But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food. If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we can distract them. They can't have been able to handle the senses yet. If we can confuse them enough, we can get those devices from their belts. All right. It may be our only chance. Look for any way to stimulate the senses. Am I disturbing you? I wish to apologise. For hitting you. I'm sorry. Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women. Well, there are better things for men and women to do. Is this where I hit you? Oh. I'm sorry. Is that better? This is. Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love. Me? We enjoy it. Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject. I did. Not when I came in. The thing is, I can't tell if we're getting anywhere. And I haven't seen Scotty in hours. You had something to say? Yes? Yes. We do think a great deal about it. You have a question? Yes, that's too bad. Why do you defy him? Huh. And how's the research going? That's not enough, Rojan. If you can't keep her, that's not my problem. Why don't you use your paralyser? You thought I was taking your woman away from you. You're jealous! You tried to kill me with your bare hands. Would a Kelvan do that? Would he have to? You're reacting with the emotions of a human. You are a human. I'm stimulating him. You have no choice. To use this ship, you have to use our form and now you're stuck with it, you and your descendants, for the next three hundred years. Look what's happened in the short time you've been exposed to us. What do you think will happen in three centuries? When this ship gets to Kelva, the people on it will be human. They'll be aliens. Enemies! Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in. You can still do that. We can bring this problem to the Federation. There are many planets in this galaxy that can be inhabited. No. But we would welcome friends. You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages. Being able to appreciate the beauty of a flower or a woman. Turn the ship around. We're going home. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

2291,TOS,episode 51,HANAR,"Drea, Tomar, report. Rojan, Hanar here. The ship is ours. We control the bridge, engineering, and life support systems. All is proceeding according to plan, Rojan. Tomar has examined the ship. The modifications are underway. It is an undisciplined environment. One cannot control it. Yet there are things of interest. Since the ship was designed to sustain these forms, we have little choice. What do you want, human? This illness came on him rather suddenly. Is it not unusual? Stand away from the door. I will have you beamed aboard. Please articulate. What are you doing? How many more of these? I see no reason for you to refer to yourself in the plural. Rojan, I want to talk to you. First, I do not like the way responsibility and duty has been portioned out to us. That is my second quarrel with you. And further, I do not care much for the way you run this ship."
2292,TOS,episode 51,ROJAN,"It was very kind of you to respond so quickly, captain. Now you will surrender your ship to me. I am Rojan of Kelva. I am your commander from this moment on. Any efforts to resist us or to escape will be severely punished. Soon we, and you, will leave this galaxy forever. You humans must face the end of your existence as you have known it. You are all paralyzed by a selective field that neutralises nerve impulses to the voluntary muscles. We can control you at will. I will now release you. Yes. Radiating from a central projector. Your ship, Captain Kirk. It will serve us well in the long voyage that is to come. To your neighbouring galaxy, which you call Andromeda. It is our home. Within ten millennia, high radiation levels in our galaxy will make life there impossible. So the Kelvan Empire sent forth ships to explore other galaxies, to search for one which our race could conquer and occupy. Captain, you think you are unconquerable and your ship impregnable, but while we've talked, the capture has already begun. Report, Hanar. Proceed with your orders. Captain, we will modify its engines, in order to produce velocities far beyond the reach of your science. The journey between galaxies will take less than three hundred of your years. Spock Fascinating. Intergalactic travel requiring only three hundred years. That is a leap far beyond anything man has yet accomplished. And our mission will be completed by a commander who is my descendant. There is an energy barrier at the rim of your galaxy. We managed to break through it with great difficulty. Our ship was destroyed. We barely managed to escape in a lifecraft. And now we have the means to begin our journey back to Andromeda. No form of transmission can penetrate the barrier. We do not colonize. We conquer. We rule. There's no other way for us. Captain, we can control the Federation as easily as we can control you. The fate of the inferior in any galaxy. Kelinda, take them to the holding area. We'll keep you and your party here, Captain. Your crew will undoubtedly wish to co-operate with us if they understand that you are hostages. Space again, Hanar. I do not think we could have kept our sanity living too long on this accursed planet. Yes, but disturbing. These shells in which we've encased ourselves, they have such heightened senses. To feel. To hear. To smell. How do humans manage to exist in these fragile cases? At least we'll be away from all of this openness. This is too strange for us, Hanar. We are creatures of outer space, and soon we will be safe in the comforting closeness of walls. This cannot go unpunished. Hanar. That one. Take him aside. Kelinda, the female. Go. As a leader, you realize the importance of discipline. I need you and these other specialists, but those two are unnecessary. I think we're somewhat alike, Captain. Each of us cares less for his own safety than for the lives of his command. We feel pain when others suffer for our mistakes. Your punishment shall be to watch them die. Captain. Proceed, Hanar. Bring them to me. This is the essence of what they were. The flesh and brain and what you call the personality, distilled down into these compact shapes. And once crushed this person is dead. However, that one can be restored. Hanar? Captain's log, stardate 4657.5. Work is proceeding on the Enterprise as my crew is forced to make the required changes in the ship for intergalactic travel. I can't forget the picture of Yeoman Thompson crushed to a handful of dust. We will beam aboard the vessel shortly. I wish you to understand your duties. You will obey. Captain Kirk, I cannot believe that you do not understand the importance of my mission. We Kelvans have a code of honour. Harsh, demanding. It calls for much from us and much from those whom we conquer. You have been conquered. I respect your devotion to your duty, but I cannot permit it to interfere with mine. Drea has computed and laid a course for Kelva, Captain. And we'll go faster yet. Increase speed to warp eleven. Very well. Yes, I was informed. You may go. Take your places, gentlemen. We're approaching the barrier. Captain's log, stardate 4658.9. With The Enterprise under control of the Kelvans, we are approaching the energy barrier at the edge of our galaxy. Spock and Scotty have devised a suicide plan to stop the Kelvans. They have rigged the ship to explode on my signal. Your people are most efficient, Captain. Hanar, start the neutralising operation. You humans are troublesome for us. We needed you to get us through the barrier. But there aren't enough of us to efficiently guard all of you of the time. Further, the food synthesisers cannot manufacture enough food for the entire journey. We are therefore neutralising all nonessential personnel. The procedure is already underway. Now, as to bridge personnel. Drea? We have no need for communication. And since Drea is capable of handling the ship from here on. Do you not agree that this is better thing for them than exploding the ship as your engineer had thought to do? We detected it, of course. Tomar has devised a mechanism to prevent any further tampering. Please accept your situation, Captain. It will make things much less painful. Is there some problem, Captain? What did he want here? In what manner? Very odd creatures, these humans. Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the lips to apologise. Kelinda has no affection for Captain Kirk. Why should I be disturbed? I have no reason for such a reaction. Kelinda's a female, nothing more. Well, of course she is! No! Certainly not. Kelinda, I've been thinking. I do not wish you to fraternise with any of the humans. Well, they, they offer such strange ideas. They're not meant for us. Not for Kelvans. No. And I wish you to particularly avoid Captain Kirk. You will do as I say, or I will neutralise your Captain Kirk and all the other humans as well. Very well. It's the way your duties have always been assigned. Hanar! Hanar, confine yourself to your quarters! Mister Spock, you were not ordered to the bridge. What is your purpose here? Very well. Proceed. Have you seen Captain Kirk? No. I was wondering where he was. He was alone then. I told her to stay away from him. Kelinda, I told you to avoid this human. I am your commander. You did this to her, corrupted her, turned her away from me! You will release her! No, I cannot be! You fool. These bodies are tools. We remain Kelvans! We have a duty, our mission. We've got to accomplish any way we can. You would really do that? You would extend welcome to invaders? Perhaps. Perhaps it could be done. But if we retain this form, where could we find a place? And you. You would wish to remain with him? Yes. Very curious. Bridge, this is Rojan. I'm returning command of the ship to Captain Kirk. You will follow his orders."
2293,TOS,episode 51,DREA,"Life support control, secure. On course and proceeding as planned. We will approach the barrier within an hour. Captain Kirk to the bridge, please. Yes, Commander. Sir?"
2294,TOS,episode 51,KELINDA,"Our ships were of multigeneration design. We were born in the intergalactic void. We shall die there during our return journey. Move there. These are lovely. Captain Kirk, what is it you call them? Our memory tapes tell us of such things on Kelvan. Crystals that form with such rapidity, they seem to grow. They look like this fragile thing somewhat. We call them Sahsheer.  Captain? What is it you wish? I don't understand, Captain. That is not necessary. You attempted to escape as we would have. Why not? Like what? No, the other side. Better? Was it intended as a remedy? Is there some significance to this action? Oh. You are trying to seduce me. I have been studying you. All humans. This business of love. You have devoted much literature to it. Why do you build such a mystique around a simple biological function? The literature? Do you really regard this touching of the lips as pleasurable? Curious. Let me try. He came to apologise for hitting me. Apparently it involves some peculiar touching contact. Yes? Why not? Have you given this order to the others? I will not. You have told me over and over again, humans are no threat to us. We are superior. I will do as I please. I would like to speak with you, Captain. Yes. This cultural mystique surrounding the biological function. You realise humans are overly preoccupied with the subject. I've done some supplemental reading on it, and, er Yes. I was wondering, would you please apologise to me again? Rojan has forbidden me to see you. It's not a question of defiance. We were told to find out everything we could about you. I need some more experiments. I did not wish to. He's most interesting, but I wish to go with you. I believe I owe you an apology. It's most pleasurable."
2295,TOS,episode 51,TOMAR,Engineering is secure. Very well. I will inform Rojan. You will stay here. I do not understand why you take the trouble to consume this bulk material to sustain yourselves. We have ascertained that these contain all the nutritional elements. I believe I will. Assist me. It's quite good. No more. Do you have more? Anything. What is it? You have more? I will try it. What? Very interesting. But I feel rather strange.

Lieutenant Galloway and I are checking out the lower levels. There seems to be no one aboard. Only uniforms. Fascinating. Aye, sir. I have their surgeon's log, Captain. Their last log entry, Captain, on screen. Interesting that the villagers know about phasers. A Yang lance, Doctor. Bruised only. We were approximately one hundred metres from the village when five of the savages ambushed us. We managed to escape without firing. Captain Tracey is being quite factual in several statements. One, the Yangs are totally contemptuous of death. They seem incredibly vicious. Two, he is also being factual in that the Yangs are massing for an attack. There are signs of thousands of them in the foothills beyond. However, he was less than truthful in one very important matter. Captain Tracey's reserve belt packs. Empty. Found among the remains of several hundred Yang bodies. A smaller attack on this village a week ago, driven off by Captain Tracey with his phaser. I have found villagers who will corroborate it. Regulations are quite harsh, but they're also quite clear, Captain. If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty. I agree that formal charges have little meaning now. However, you must at least confiscate his phaser. Not that I have observed, Captain. Of course, should they wish to do so, one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied. Good, Captain. Try to reason with them. Keep trying, Captain. Their behaviour is highly illogical. I have tried, Captain. {Storeroom] Captain, I have managed to loosen this grill somewhat. If the mortar on yours is as old. Captain Tracey mentioned there was once a considerable civilisation here. The only reasonable explanation would be a war. Nuclear devastation or a bacteriological holocaust. Yes, I heard, Captain. Captain? Captain? Captain, are you able to respond? Seven hours and eight minutes, Captain. We can contact the ship in a few moments, Captain, if I can cross-circuit this unit. War created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it. Ready, Captain. Quite crude. Voice communication will not be possible, but we can signal the ship. I'm weak, Captain, but not in difficulty. My need for attention is vital, Doctor, but our need for departure is even more immediate. Yes. I see, Captain. They would've learned to wear skins, adopted stoic mannerisms, learned the bow and the lance. Kohms? Communists? The parallel is almost too close, Captain. It would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided, and in this case, the Asiatics won and took over this planet. I am open to suggestions, Doctor. I'm making a suggestion. There's no question about his guilt, Captain, but does our involvement here also constitute a violation of the Prime Directive?"

They're still here. These white crystals. That's what's left of the human body when you take the water away, which makes up ninety six percent of our bodies. Without water, we're all just three or four pounds of chemicals. Something crystallised them down to this.  Tell the lab the final reading on our tissue is Y three X point zero zero four. And I could use a second blood analyser unit. Our tissues definitely show a massive infection, Jim, but something is immunising us down here, thank heavens, or we'd have been dead hours ago. The problem is, it could be anything Some spores or pollen in the air, some chemical. Just finding it could take months, maybe even years. And I've only got one lead. The infection resembles one developed by Earth during their bacteriological warfare experiments in the 1990s. Hard to believe we were once foolish enough to play around with that. Now wait a minute. He lost his ship and his crew, and he found himself the only thing standing between an entire village of peaceful people. Without a serum, we're trapped here with the villagers. Now why destroy what's left of the man by arresting him? Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning, Jim. Yes. I'm convinced that once there was a frightening biological war that existed here. The virus still exists. Then over the years, nature built up these natural immunising agents in the food, the water, and the soil. That's right. These immunising agents take time, and that's the real tragedy. Had the Exeter landing party stayed here just a few hours longer, they never would have died. Survival of the fittest, because their ancestors who survived had to have a superior resistance. Then they built up these powerful protective antibodies in the blood during the wars. Now, if you want to destroy a civilisation or a whole world, your descendants might develop a longer life, but I hardly think it's worth it. Who knows? It might eventually cure the common cold, but lengthen lives? Poppycock. I can do more for you if you just eat right and exercise regularly. He'll live, but I'll have to get him to better facilities than this. He's fully immunised now. We all are. Leave medicine to medical men, Captain. You found no fountain of youth here. People live longer here now because it's natural for them to. He must have attention soon. You're a romantic, Jim. His heart is different! The internal organs of a Vulcan are Spock, I've found that evil usually triumphs unless good is very, very careful. Spock, we've got to do something! What are you doing?"

It's a very interesting proposition. Let me think it over. I don't think we have the right or the wisdom to interfere, however a planet is evolving. Don't they ever rest? Thank you, Spock. At least tell me why you want to kill me. No point in repeating that it's illogical, Spock. I'm quite aware of it. Pity you can't teach me that. I can't even get at it. He'd be on me in a moment. Keep talking, Spock. Don't let me doze off. That's a very interesting theory. The yellow civilisation is almost destroyed, the white civilisation is destroyed. Keep working on the window if we're ever going to regain our freedom. Spock. Well, well, well. It is our worship word, too. Am I not now a prisoner of the Kohms as you are? Why did you not speak until now? Spock, we'll have you out in a minute. Spock. How long? Seven hours and eight. Spock. Keys. I'll have you out in a minute. Good morning. Good. Did you find out anything? There is a disease here, something that affected the Exeter landing party and us. Then we can leave any time we want to. Tracey is of the opinion these immunising agents can become a fountain of youth. There are people here over a thousand years old, Bones. Then anything you develop here as a result of all this is useless. All that bloodshed for nothing. That'll be sufficient, Mister Spock. We can beam up at any time. Any of us. There's no serum! There are no miracles! There's no immortality here! All this is for nothing! Do what you can for him, Doctor. Where is everybody? We can beam up, Tracey. All of us. All right. Kirk to Enterprise. Yes, quite all right. I'd like ten phasers beamed down with three extra power packs, please. Have you got that? Enterprise, do you read me? Not even if we're in danger, Mister Sulu? The situation is not immediately dangerous. Have the volunteers stand by. Kirk out. Spock? If my ancestors were forced out of the cities into the deserts, the hills Living like the Indians, and finally even looking like the American Indian. American. Yangs? Yanks? Spock, Yankees!  But if it were true, all these generations of Yanks fighting to regain their land. And to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. In my land we have a tribe like you. Up there. One of those points of light that you see at night. You're confusing the stars with heaven. We're not gods! We're not evil ones. We're men, like yourselves. Are your faces alike? Can you tell from them which of you is good and which of you is evil? Those words are familiar. Wait a moment. No, wait! There's a better way. Does not your sacred book promise that good is stronger than evil? We'll discuss that later, Lieutenant. Leslie, free Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock. Put Captain Tracey under arrest. Now, Cloud William. I did not recognise those words, you said them so badly, Without meaning. This was not written for chiefs. Hear me! Hear this! Among my people, we carry many such words as this from many lands, many worlds. Many are equally good and are as well respected, but wherever we have gone, no words have said this thing of importance in quite this way. Look at these three words written larger than the rest, with a special pride never written before or since. Tall words proudly saying We the People. That which you call Ee'd Plebnista was not written for the chiefs or the kings or the warriors or the rich and powerful, but for all the people! Down the centuries, you have slurred the meaning of the words, 'We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution.' These words and the words that follow were not written only for the Yangs, but for the Kohms as well! They must apply to everyone or they mean nothing! Do you understand? We merely showed them the meaning of what they were fighting for. Liberty and freedom have to be more than just words. Gentlemen, the fighting is over here. I suggest we leave them to discover their history and their liberty. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

2643,TOS,episode 52,TRACEY,"Put the axe away, Liyang. I knew someone would come looking for us. I'm just sorry it had to be you, Jim. I'm glad your arrival stopped this. No more of this, Wu. Lock up the savages. WU I said lock up the savages. The prisoners are called Yangs. Impossible even to communicate with. Hordes of them out there. They'll attack anything that moves. Our medi-scanners revealed this planet as perfectly harmless. The villagers, the Kohms here, were friendly enough once they got over the shock of my white skin. As you've seen, we resemble the Yangs, the savages. My landing party transported back to the ship. I stayed down here to arrange for the planet survey with the village elders. The next thing I knew, the ship was calling me. The landing party had taken an unknown disease back. My crew, Jim. My entire crew. Gone. And I'm just as infected as they were. As you are. But I stayed alive because I stayed down here. There's some natural immunisation that protects everyone on the planet surface. I don't know what it is. You'd be dying by now, along with the rest of the Enterprise crew. You'll stay alive only as long as you stay here. None of us will ever leave this planet. Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise has left the Exeter and moved into close planet orbit. Although it appears the infection may strand us here the rest of our lives, I face an even more difficult problem. A growing belief that Captain Tracey has been interfering with the evolution of life on this planet. It seems impossible. A star captain's most solemn oath is that he will give his life, even his entire crew, rather than violate the Prime Directive. I'll be sending the next message, Jim. Enterprise, come in. Captain Tracey of the Exeter. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your captain and landing party must have beamed down too late for full immunisation. They've been found unconscious, but I'm doing everything I can for them now. There's no point in risking more lives, Lieutenant. Since I've acquired some immunity perhaps the others At their next word, kill him. I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Your captain's feverish, quite delirious. I'll contact you later, let you know of any future needs. Landing party out. That's enough of that, Captain. Leave us. I must now consider myself under arrest, unless in the presence of the most senior fellow officers presently available, I give satisfactory answer to those charges which you now bring. Et cetera, et cetera. Those were the first words duty required you to say to me, and you said them. You're covered. Now, suppose we go on to the next subject. Good. Direct, succinct. Answer. No native to this planet has ever had any trace of any kind of disease. How long would a man live if all disease were erased, Jim? Wu. Tell Captain Kirk your age. WU Their year of the red bird comes once every eleven years, which he's seen forty two times. Multiply it. Wu is four hundred and sixty two years old. His father is well over a thousand. Interested, Jim? He will if you order it. We must have a doctor researching this. Are you grasping all it means? This immunising agent here, once we've found it, is a fountain of youth. Virtual immortality, or as much as any man will ever want. Out. By those who own the serum. McCoy will eventually isolate it. Meanwhile, you inform your ship your situation's impossible. Order them away. When we're ready, we'll bargain for a whole fleet of ships to pick us up. And they'll do it. We've got to stay alive. Let the Yangs kill us and destroy what we have to offer and we'll have committed a crime against all humanity. I'd say that's slightly more important than the Prime Directive, wouldn't you, Jim? Guards. Take the doctor back to his workplace. The pointed-eared one stays. And Wu, tell your men we'll be leaving soon. We'll be in ambush for the Yangs. With many fire boxes this time. What do you think of that, Jim? Animals who happen to look like us. You still think the Prime Directive's for this planet? Well, if logic won't work, perhaps this will. Put him in there. No messages. Kirk, the savage in the cell with you. Did you set him free? You sent him, Kirk. You sent him to warn the tribes! The Yangs must've been warned. They sacrificed hundreds just to draw us out in the open. And then they came, and they came. We drained four of our phasers, and they still came. We killed thousands and they still came. Impossible! You can't carry the disease up to the ship with you. You've isolated the serum? Explain it to him, Doctor. Outside. Or I'll burn down both your friends now. Dead or in hiding. Now let's see how eager you are to die. Call your ship. I need your help, Kirk. They're going to attack the village. My phaser's almost drained. We need new, fresh ones. You're not just going to stand there and let them kill you, are you? If I put a weapon in your hand you'll fight, won't you? I want five phasers. No, ten. With three extra power packs each. Say again. You have a well-trained bridge crew, Captain. My compliments. They can be handled, Jim. Together it'll be easy. I caution you, gentlemen, don't fight me here. I'll win. Or at worst, I'll drag you down with me. He was cast out! Don't you recognise the Evil One? Who else would trick you with your own sacred words? Let your God strike me dead if I lie. But he won't, because I speak for him. You tried to kill me. Would a man know your holy words? Would a man use them to trick you? See his servant? His face, his eyes, his ears? Do the Yang legends describe this servant of the evil one? You command him. Everyone's seen that. You want more proof? He has no heart. He fears to speak them, for indeed his tongue would burn with fire. Force him! Kill his servant unless he speaks, so you may see if the words burn him."

2661,TOS,episode 53,SPOCK,"Commodore Wesley. How do you do, sir? The most ambitious computer complex ever created. Its purpose is to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship, to provide the ultimate in vessel operation and control. I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore. I'm well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries. The basic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's. We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently than man. The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship surgeon. I am honoured, Doctor. Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not have the promise of this. The M-5 has been perfected, Commander. Its potential is a fact. If I can be of assistance, Doctor. M-5 has performed admirably so far. Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom. With the course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator. In fact, it might have been a further demonstration of M-5's capability. Enjoy, Captain? No. I'm merely gratified to see Doctor Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly efficient manner. M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career. The planet is class M, Captain. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support. Two major land masses, a number of islands, life form readings. M-5's readout, Captain. Captain, the computer does not judge. It makes logical selections. I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor. You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism. However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before. Doctor, this unit is not a human body. The computer can process information, but only the information which is put into it. Captain, sensors report two contacts now. One on the port bow, one on the stern. Distance, two hundred thousand kilometres and closing. We are not scheduled for war games in this area. This may be a surprise attack as a problem for the M-5. Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain. Attacking vessels are moving off. Minor hit on deflector screen four. No appreciable damage. The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvred her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control. Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing can replace it, or him. Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet Academy. It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose. Another contact, Captain. A large, slow-moving vessel. Unidentified. This is not a drill. M-5 has identified her, Captain. The Woden. Listed in Starfleet Registry as an old-style ore freighter converted to automation. No crew. Coming into visual range. No effect on any of the M-5 controls, Captain. Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target. Full power. All systems report normal, Captain. I would say, Captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself. M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines, tapping the matter-antimatter reserves. The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines. The computer now controls all helm, navigation, and engineering functions. There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit relays might be disrupted from engineering level three. Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the computer would perform. Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved logically. No. But it is interesting. Good. Spock to Captain Kirk. We are ready, Captain. Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does so, I shall trip the manual override into control. Manual override is in control, Captain. Mister Chekov. Examine the H two seven nine elements, also the G nine five systems. Thank you, Ensign. It appears, Captain, we've been doing what used to be called pursuing a wild goose. M-5 has rerouted helm and navigational controls, bypassing this primary system. I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals. I do not know. It is not performing in a logical manner. I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost human pattern. Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation, attacking at will. Hit on the Lexington. Hit in engineering section. Possible damage to her impulse engines. She's still maneuverable on warp drive. The Excalibur, a direct hit. Lexington hit again. Probably true, Captain. It works faster, thinks faster than we do. It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible in a computer. Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5 circuits. Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to believe you would harm it. I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Doctor Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind. M5 Fascinating. Every living thing wants to survive, Captain. Daystrom must have impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer. Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander. I should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death. Captain, attack force almost within phaser range. M-5 is leaving itself open to attack. The machine is committing suicide to atone for the sin of murder. Spock to Captain. The force field is gone, Captain. M-5 is neutralised. I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same condition. Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable? Logically, that is the sort of trap M-5 should have set. No, Doctor. I simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings, not better. I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that question. It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a computer, Doctor. The resulting torrential flood of illogic would be most entertaining."

2669,TOS,episode 53,MCCOY,"I don't like it, Jim. A vessel this size cannot be run by one computer. Maybe you're trying to prove that, Spock, but don't count me in on it. Very funny. If it could, they wouldn't have to replace me. I'd resign because everybody else aboard would be nothing but circuits and memory banks. You know the type, Spock. Jim, you haven't had much to say about this. Frankly, the only fact that I'm concerned about is if this thing doesn't work, there are not enough men aboard to run the ship. That's begging for trouble. Doctor Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer. Is it supposed to do that? Did you see the love light in Spock's eyes? The right computer finally came along. What's the matter, Jim? I think it's wrong, too, replacing men with mindless machines. Jim, we've all seen the advances of mechanisation. After all, Daystrom did design the computers that run this ship. We're all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to a machine. When it comes to your job, that's different. And it always will be different. Jim, if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question, you don't need me to answer it for you. Why don't you ask James T. Kirk? He's a pretty honest guy. All the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5 is informed there are patients to be cared for. Dunsel? Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel? What does it mean, Jim? Spock? What does it mean? This isn't chicken soup. I may be just a ship's doctor, but I make a Finagle's Folly that's known from here to Orion. I strongly prescribe it, Jim. To James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. Simple but effective. It's a line from a poem. A very old poem, isn't it? Jim. Fantastic machine, the M-5. No off switch. Normal? That thing's trying to tell us nothing has happened. There certainly does. Your brilliant young computer just destroyed an ore freighter. In fact it went out of its way to destroy an ore freighter! In which case you'd be guilty of murder. And communications and fire control. I'll get the man responsible in the first place. Where is Daystrom? Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating. Have you found a solution, a way to shut that thing off? Learning to kill. That thing is a danger to us all. Now find some way to shut it off. The biographical tape of Richard Daystrom. Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius. In his early twenties, Jim. That's over a quarter of a century ago. Maybe that's the trouble. Where do you go from up? You publish articles, you give lectures, then spend your life trying to recapture past glory. The M-1 through M-4, remember? Not entirely successful. That's the way Daystrom put it. Right. The government bought it, then Daystrom had to make it work. And he did. But according to Spock, it works illogically. Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed perhaps, he'd still tend to protect that child. I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it. Decoyed. It wanted us to waste our time. But M-5 doesn't know it's a game. If that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships, we're in Of course. I don't like the sound of him, Jim. Jim, he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown, if not insanity. He'll have to be committed to a total rehabilitation centre. Right now he's under sedation and heavy restraints. Compassion. That's the one thing no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Care to debate that, Spock? But tell me, which do you prefer to have around? I was just trying to make conversation, Spock."

M5 Captain, I've located the source of the power shutdowns. It's the M-5 unit, sir. That thing's turning off systems all over the ship. Reverse thrusts will not engage, sir. Manual override isn't working either. Captain, I suggest we disconnect it at the source. So now it has virtually unlimited power. Captain, what'll we do? Aye. I can take them out and cut in the manual override from there. If Mister Spock helps me, maybe an hour. Aye, that's got it, Mister Spock. That's it, Mister Spock. But it was active.

2675,TOS,episode 53,KIRK,"Not now, Leslie. Lieutenant, contact the space station. All right. Put them on. Yes, Commodore, I'd like an explanation Spock. Bob. I'll say. Spock, this is All right, Ensign. You can go. Thank you very much. Would you mind telling me what this is all about? I receive orders to proceed here. No reason given. I'm informed that my men will be removed to the space station, to a security holding area. I think I'm entitled to an explanation. What's that? An entire attack force against my ship? That's Doctor Richard Daystrom's device, isn't it? Tell me about that. What has all this got to do with the Enterprise? Why remove my crew? How much security does this gadget require? Twenty? I can't run a starship with twenty crew. And what am I supposed to do? What do you want me to say? M-5 is an honour, they tell me. Well, I'm honoured. Where is he? Scotty, where's Doctor Daystrom? Doctor Daystrom, this is my first officer, Mister Spock. Well, by all means, do so. Mister Scott, hook in the multitronic unit to the ship's main power banks. I wouldn't worry, Doctor. Doctor McCoy has clearance throughout the ship. I'm curious, Doctor. Why is it called M-5 and not M-1? Total control? There are certain things men must do to remain men. Your computer would take that away. You'll have to prove that to me, Doctor. I think that thing is wrong, and I don't know why. I don't mean that. I'm getting a Red Alert right here. That thing is dangerous. I feel. Only a fool would stand in the way of progress, if this is progress. You have my psychological profiles. Am I afraid of losing my job to that computer? Under human control. Am I afraid of losing command to a computer? Daystrom's right. I can do a lot of other things. Am I afraid of losing the prestige and the power that goes with being a starship captain? Is that why I'm fighting it? Am I that petty? The M-5 computer is now disengaged. All it's done is make the required course changes and some simple turns. Mister Sulu and Mister Chekov could've done that with their eyes closed. My orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the M-5 is in control. I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Doctor Daystrom. You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer. If you don't mind, I'll make my own recommendations. M-5 is committed. Standard orbit, Mister Sulu. Oh, yes. Report, Mister Spock. Check it out, Scotty. All right, my recommendations are as follows. We send down general survey party, avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the planet's surface. The survey party will consist of myself, Doctor McCoy, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Rawlins and Science Officer Spock. Well, the only difference in reports and recommendations is the landing party personnel. That's only a matter of judgment. Why pick Carstairs instead of Rawlins? Carstairs is an ensign, no experience. This is his first tour of duty. Rawlins is chief geologist. Have you located the malfunction, Doctor? Yes, that's correct. Granted, it can work a thousand, a million times faster than the human brain, but it can't make a value judgment. It hasn't intuition. It can't think. Kirk here. What is it? I'll be right up. What are you doing here, Bones? Identification. Put it on audio. Acknowledge, Lieutenant. Then go to Red Alert. Already sounded the Red Alert. All right, Mister Sulu, phasers one one hundredth power. No damage potential, just enough to nudge them. Report on damage sustained in mock attack. Evaluation of M-5 performance. It'll be necessary for the log. Machine over man, Spock? It was impressive. It might even be practical. Put it on visual. Secure from general quarters. I'm not interested in eating, Bones. I've, I've never felt this way before. At odds with the ship. I sat there and watched my ship perform for a mass of circuits and relays, and felt useless. Unneeded. To Captain Dunsel. Thank you, Doctor. That's one of your better prescriptions. Do you know the one, 'All I ask is a tall ship'? 20th century Earth. 'All I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer by'. You could feel the wind at your back in those days. The sounds of the sea beneath you. And even if you take away the wind and the water, it's still the same. The ship is yours. You can feel her. And the stars are still there, Bones. Kirk here. On my way. Lieutenant, get Daystrom up here. Disengaging M-5 unit. Cut speed to warp one. Navigator, go to course one one three mark seven. I want that ship given a wide berth. Scotty, reverse engines. Slow us down. These controls are locked. We can't disengage the computer. Daystrom, release that computer control! Disengage this computer now. But it shouldn't have destroyed anything. There might just as easily have been a crew aboard that ship. Bones. Disengage the computer. Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Tell them we are breaking off M-5 tests and returning to the space station. Come along, Doctor Daystrom, M-5 is out of a job. All right, Daystrom, let's turn this thing off. Force field? You mean it's not going to let any of us turn it off. Captain 's Log, stardate 4731.3. The M-5 multitronic unit has taken over total control of the Enterprise. All right, Doctor, you built this thing. How do you propose to turn it off? Correct it after you release control of my ship. No! Stay here. All right, Scotty. Turn it off. That wasn't a minor difficulty. That wasn't a robot. That thing murdered one of my crewman and you tell me you can't turn it off? And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way? Spock, Scotty, come with me. Report, Spock. We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour. We must regain control of the ship by then. Scotty? How long? Make it less. He's with the M-5 unit, watching it. I think it surprised even him. Did you find anything? Genius is an understatement. At the age of twenty four, he made the duotronic breakthrough that won him the Nobel and Zee-Magnes prizes. Isn't that enough for one lifetime? All right, it's difficult. What's your point? Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein, Kazanga, or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, today I will be brilliant. No matter how long it took, he came out with multitronics. The M-5. And he won't let Spock near it. What are you saying, that he's tampering with it, that he's making it act that way? Why? Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality. Kirk here. Good. Get Daystrom. We're on our way. Let's go. We're going to find out, Doctor. Spock? Good, go ahead. Daystrom, we're going to do our best. Spock. Bridge, this is Kirk. Sulu? We've got helm and navigational control. Turn us about. Have Mister Chekov plot a course back to the space station. Kirk here. Go to the engineering station. While it was getting ready for what? Spock? Doctor Daystrom. Doctor Daystrom, I want an answer right now. I'm tired of hearing about the M-5's new approach. What is it, exactly? What is it? Well, Doctor? Your new approach? Kirk here. What is it? The main attack force. The war games. Correction, Bones. Those four ships don't know it's M-5's game. And M-5 is going to destroy them. Put it on. Daystrom, does M-5 understand that this is only a drill? Full strength? That's no miscalculation. Estimate damage on Lexington, Spock. There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5. There's got to be a way! Lieutenant? There's your murder charge. Deliberate. Calculated. It's killing men and women. Four starships, sixteen hundred men and women! Daystrom! Whose engrams? The computer tie-in. You spoke to it before. It knows you. You can save the M-5 if you talk to it and make it stop the attack. You'd better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him. M5 Spock. The M-5 is not responding to him like a computer. It's talking to him. The M-5 must be destroyed. Security, take him to Sickbay. Take care of him, Doctor. Battle status? Go on. They've just signed their own death warrant. M-5 will kill them to survive. Suppose it's still open to impression. Suppose it absorbed the regret Daystrom felt for the deaths it caused. The guilt. The instrument of his death will not be the Enterprise if I can help it. M-5, tie-in. M5 This is Captain Kirk. You will be under attack in a moment. M5 You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly crippled. Many lives were lost. M5 Why? M5 There were many men aboard those ships. They were murdered. Must you survive by murder? M5 Why? M5 But you have murdered. Scan the starship Excalibur, which you destroyed. Is there life aboard? M5 Because you murdered it. What is the penalty for murder? M5 And how will you pay for your acts of murder? M5 M-5? Scotty, Spock, before it changes its mind. Get down to Engineering, pull out every hook up that makes M-5 run. Pull out the plug, Spock. Lieutenant. Intership communications. This is the captain speaking. In approximately one minute, we'll be attacked by Federation starships. The M-5 no longer controls the ship, but neither do we control it. The M-5 has left itself, and us, open for destruction. For whatever satisfaction we may get from the knowledge, our nineteen lives will buy the survival of over one thousand of our fellow starship crewmen. Kirk here. I need communications. Then cut power. Cut power. Keep those shields down. That's exactly the situation I was hoping for when I forced the M-5 to realise it had committed murder. Daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of God and man. The computer that carried his engrams also believed it. I wasn't sure. Any other commander would have simply followed orders and destroyed us, but I knew Bob Wesley. I gambled on his humanity. Bridge. His logical selection was compassion. Mister Sulu, take us back to the space station. Ahead, warp factor two. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

2999,TOS,episode 53,DAYSTROM,"Yes? Ah, you'd be Captain Kirk. Thank you. Thank you very much. Captain, I've finished my tests on the M-5, and it must be hooked into your main power plants in order to be operative. Your engineer there wouldn't allow us the power necessary without your orders. Now, who is this? Well, I'm sorry, but this is a security area. No, no, no. Thank you. I can manage. There's nothing wrong, Captain. Just a few minor settling-in adjustments to make. As you can see, all is in order now. Well, you see, the multitronic units one through four were not entirely successful. This one is. M-5 is ready to take control of the ship. That is what it was designed for, Captain. There are other things a man like you might do. Or perhaps you object to the possible loss of prestige and ceremony accorded a starship captain. A computer can do your job and without all that. That is what we're here for, isn't it, Captain? Yes, but you see, the idea is they didn't have to do it. And you'll find it won't be necessary for you to regain control of the unit after it's completed each manoeuvre. Captain, your orders at this point are not open to interpretation. You must commit the M-5 to handle its approach, the orbit, and then to analyse data regarding landing party recommendations. Well, if you feel you need the exercise, go on, Captain. Play M-5's recommendations, won't you, Mister Spock? M5 Judgment, Captain? Aren't you really more interested in why M-5 did not select you and Doctor McCoy? Well, let's find out anyway. M-5 tie-in. M5 Explanation for landing party recommendation. M5 Why were the Captain and the Chief Medical Officer not included in recommendation? M5 As I suspected, it is not a malfunction. M-5 was merely shutting down power to areas of the ship that do not require it. Decks four and six are living quarters, are they not? And currently unoccupied. Quite right. As the unit is called upon to do more work, it pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it, just as the human body draws more energy to run than to stand still. Can't you understand? The multitronic unit is a revolution in computer science. I designed the duotronic elements used in your ship right now, and I know they are as archaic as dinosaurs compared to the M-5. A whole new approach. Rather impressive display for a machine, wouldn't you say, Captain? Captain, what is it? There appears to be some defect in the control panel. Fortunately it was only a robot ship. It's not my doing, Kirk. This exercise is a trial for M-5. A shakedown. We must expect minor difficulties, but I assure you they can be corrected. I can't. Give me a few moments with it. It wasn't a deliberate act. M-5's analysis told it it needed a new power source. The ensign simply got in the way. You don't shut a child off when it makes a mistake. M-5 is growing, learning. To defend itself. It's quite a different thing. When a child is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point, if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was taught, thinks independently. You can't understand. You're frightened because you can't understand it. I'm going to show you. I'm going to show all of you. It takes four hundred thirty people to man a starship. With this, you don't need anyone. One machine can do all those things they send men out to do now. Men no longer need die in space or on some alien world. Men can live and go on to achieve greater things than fact-finding and dying for galactic space, which is neither ours to give or to take. They can't understand. We don't want to destroy life, we want to save it. What is it, Captain? No! No, no, no. You can't take control from the M-5. You can't do it. Now let me work with it for a while, please. Please. Please, please! Yes, quite right, Mister Spock. You see, one of the arguments against computers controlling ships was that they couldn't think like men. Exactly. I've developed a method of impressing human engrams upon the computer circuits. The relays are not unlike the synapse of the brain. M-5 thinks, Captain. Of course. It was programmed to understand, Captain. The ore ship was a miscalculation, an accident. I don't know There isn't. It's fully protected itself. It misunderstood. I really don't know how to get to the M-5. I really do not know. Why, mine, of course. They can't do that. They'll destroy the M-5. I can make it stop. I created it. M-5 tie-in. M5 This is, this is Daystrom. M5 M-5, do you know me? M5 Stop. M-5, your attack on the starships is wrong. You must break it off. But these are not enemy vessels. These are Federation starships. You're killing, We are killing, murdering human beings, beings of our own kind. You were not created for that purpose. You are my greatest creation. The unit to save men. You must not destroy men. M5 Survive, yes. Protect yourself, but not murder. You must not die. Men must not die. To kill is a breaking of civil and moral laws we've lived by for thousands of years. You've murdered hundreds of people. We've murdered. How can we repay that? M5 We will survive. Nothing can hurt you. I gave you that. You are great. I am great. Twenty years of groping to prove the things I'd done before were not accidents. Seminars and lectures to rows of fools who couldn't begin to understand my systems. Colleagues. Colleagues laughing behind my back at the boy wonder and becoming famous building on my work. Building on my work. Destroyed, Kirk? No. We're invincible. Look what we've done. Your mighty starships, Four toys to be crushed as we choose."
3000,TOS,episode 53,WESLEY,"Are you surprised? Mister Spock. You've had a singular honour conferred on you, Jim. You're going to be the fox in the hunt. War games. I'll be commanding the attack force against you. Have you heard of the M-5 multitronic unit? How do you know so much about it, Commander? You've been chosen to test the M-5, Jim. There'll be a series of routine research and contact problems for the M-5 to solve, plus navigational manoeuvres and the war games problem. If the M-5 works under actual conditions as well as it has under simulated tests, it will mean a revolution in space technology as great as warp drive. When your crew has been removed, the ship's engineering section will be modified to contain the computer. They're not needed. None. Doctor Daystrom will see to the installation himself and he'll supervise the tests. When he's ready, you'll receive your orders and proceed on the mission with a crew of twenty. The M-5 can. You've got a great job, Jim. All you have to do is sit back and let the machine do the work. Captain's Log, stardate 4729.4. The M-5 computer has been installed on board ship, and we have left the space station for test manoeuvres. Enterprise from Commodore Wesley aboard the Lexington. This is an unscheduled M-5 drill. Repeat, this is an M-5 drill. Enterprise, acknowledge on this frequency. Enterprise from starships Lexington and Excalibur. Both ships report simulated hits in sufficient quantity and location to justify awarding the surprise engagement to Enterprise. Our compliments to the M-5 unit, and regards to Captain Dunsel. Wesley out. Enterprise from Lexington. This is an M-5 drill. Repeat. This is an M-5 drill. Acknowledge. Full phasers. What the devil is Kirk doing? Damage report, Lieutenant. Helm, course one six four, mark three. Enterprise. Jim. Have you gone mad? What are you trying to prove? Break off the attack! Jim, we have fifty three dead here, twelve on the Excalibur. If you can hear us, stop the attack! Jim, why don't you answer? Jim! Answer! Come in, Jim! Jim, break off your attack! All ships damaged in unprovoked attack. Excalibur Captain Harris and first officer dead. Many casualties. We have damage, but are still able to manoeuvre. The Enterprise refuses to answer and is continuing attack. I still have an effective battle force and believe the only way to stop the Enterprise is to destroy her. Request permission to proceed. Wesley, commanding attack force, out. Acknowledged. Lexington out. Phasers on target. The Enterprise looks dead. I'm going to take a chance he's not just laying a trap. Wesley to attack force. Break off attack. Do not fire. The Enterprise has dropped her shields. I repeat, hold attack. Do not fire."

Captain, no signs of bodies whatsoever. It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two, directly ahead. SS Beagle. Small class four stardrive vessel. Crew of forty seven, commanded by. Jim, I believe you knew him. Captain R M Merik. Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to water is exactly as on your Earth. Density five point five, diameter seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. Again, exactly like Earth. I also picked up indications of large cities. No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio communications, power transportation, an excellent road system. Television was the colloquial term. Captain, the one described as the barbarian is also listed here. Flight officer William B. Harrison of the SS Beagle. At least there were some survivors down there. But hardly more practical, captain. Close to the city we located, but not populated. We should not be observed. Fascinating. This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your twentieth century. Moderately industrialised pollution containing substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed hydrocarbons. Yes, I believe that was the term. I had no idea you were that much of a historian, Doctor. Then the Prime Directive is in full force, Captain? I fail to see the humour in that situation, Doctor. Complete Earth parallel. The language here is English. There would seem to be evidence to that effect. I call them ears. Never. Colloquial twentieth-century English. An amazing parallel. Sir, we came here looking for some friends, forty seven of them who were stranded here some six years ago. They wore clothing similar to ours. Have you heard of such men? Captain, I thought you might find this interesting. Fascinating. Captain, a logical question, if I may. Septimus, how many years ago did Merikus become your first citizen? Curious, Captain, the similarity in names. Were you told why Merik was dropped from the Space Academy? Why, Doctor? Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions. Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me. Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I assumed it was trial and error. Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite understandable. I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating. They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, Doctor. Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on? Quite correct. I tell you I'm well able to defeat you. I do not want to injure you. Need any help, Doctor? Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the strength of the door. Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be brief? Yes, that's quite true. Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However, Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore Really, Doctor? What did they do to you? I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely. It seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total brotherhood. Sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion. It will replace their imperial Rome, but it will happen in their twentieth century."

Aye. Transmission lost, sir. Shall I try to get it back? I'm afraid you have it all wrong, Mister Spock, all of you. I've been monitoring some of their old-style radio waves, the empire spokesman trying to ridicule their religion. But he couldn't. Don't you understand? It's not the sun up in the sky. It's the Son of God."

3023,TOS,episode 54,MCCOY,"The word was smog. I am not, Mister Spock. I was simply trying to stop you from giving us a whole lecture on the subject. Jim, is there anything at all we know about this planet? No references to space, or the fact that there are other worlds, or more advanced civilisations. One, just once, I'd like to be able to land someplace and say, Behold, I am the Archangel Gabriel. Naturally. You could hardly claim to be an angel with those pointed ears, Mister Spock. But say you landed someplace with a pitchfork. For which we are grateful, for we are men of peace ourselves. Well, if you're speaking of worships of sorts, we represent many beliefs. Odd that these people should worship the sun. Because, my dear Mister Spock, it is illogical. Rome had no sun worshipers. Why should they parallel Rome in every way except one? Quite logical, I'd say, Mister Spock. Just as it's logical that twentieth-century Rome would use television to show its gladiator contests or name a new car the Jupiter Eight. What term? Logic? Medical men are trained in logic, Mister Spock. I do? No, I think I can walk. I'll try. Are you out of your head? Next he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history. They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism. You must know that's impossible. Starfleet regulations Jim. Must you always be so blasted honest? I am defending myself! Whatever gave you that idea? You tell him, buster. Of all the completely ridiculous, illogical questions I ever heard in my life! Angry, Mister Spock, or frustrated, perhaps? For the fifteenth time. Spock. Spock, I know we've had our disagreements. Maybe they're jokes. I don't know. As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves sometimes, but what I'm trying to say is Well, what I'm trying to say is you saved my life in the arena. I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin! Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock? You're more afraid of living. Each day you stay alive is just one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out. That's it, isn't it? Insecurity. Why, you wouldn't know what to do with a genuine, warm, decent feeling. I know. I'm worried about Jim, too. Jim! What happened, Jim? Captain, I see on your report Flavius was killed. I am sorry. I liked that huge sun worshiper. A philosophy of total love and total brotherhood."

But they have used the code term Condition Green, which means they're in trouble. But it also prohibits my taking any action. Mister Chekov, pinpoint power source locations. Type, power, load factors, and how much our beams will have to pull to overload them. Let it take time, lad. They're in trouble, and I'm under orders not to interfere. However, no order can stop me from frightening them. It may do no good, but it may suggest to someone just what a starship can really do. Aye. Now, Mister Chekov. Activate.   Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Ready to beam up three. Captain's log, stardate 4041.7. Note commendation, Engineering Officer Scott. Despite enormous temptation > Thank you, Captain."
3029,TOS,episode 54,KIRK,"Missing for six years, and now this junk in space. Then whatever destroyed the ship, the crew was able to get off safely. Navigator, compute the present drift of the wreckage. Mister Spock, assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same speed and direction for the past six years? Standard orbit around the planet. There may be survivors there. Yes, at the academy. He was dropped in his fifth year. He went into the merchant service. Put it on the screen. Yes, similar. But the land masses and oceans are quite different, however. Exactly in some ways, different in others. What era? Put it on the screen. Slaves and gladiators. What are we seeing, a twentieth-century Rome? Ready the transporter room, Mister Spock. We're beaming down. You could have selected a more convenient place, Mister Spock. The SS Beagle was the first ship to make a survey of this star sector when it disappeared. No identification of self or mission. No interference with the social development of said planet. Let's go. I think he means it, Spock. We come from another province. We come from a place that's quite some journey from here. I doubt if you've heard Do we look like any Romans you ever saw ? Our people don't believe in slavery. Wait. I can prove we're telling the truth. A small device. I'll take it out slowly. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Scotty, lock in on my transmission beam. Scan us. Including ourselves, how many of us are there? Good, Scotty. Continue scanning. We'll maintain transmission. Kirk out. The Enterprise is our ship, somewhere at sea. That's all I can tell you. If it isn't sufficient, you will have to kill us. Perhaps you've heard, let's say, an impossible story or a rumour of men who came from the sky or from other worlds. The stars. Yes, of course. Spock? The Jupiter Eight. Conventional internal combustion engine. You were right about the smog. But the Jupiter Eight? Mars toothpaste. Neptune bath salts. Septimus, we need your help. We must go into the city. We know that one of our missing friends was seen there recently. We can't do that. Perhaps you know his name. Merik. Captain Merik. Yes. He's the leader of our friends. That doesn't sound like the same man. Septimus, wherever we may be from, you must believe that it is one of our most important laws that none of us interfere with the affairs of others. If Captain Merik is Merikus, then he has violated that law, and he must be taken away and punished. Will you help us get to the truth of all this? He failed a psycho-simulator test. All it takes is a split second of indecision. Hardly the type to become a political strongman. Are you a slave, Flavius? Then you heard the word of the sun? There are many things I'd like to know Tell Merikus I'd like to see him. Tell him it's Jim Kirk. Perhaps a friend. Well, if I am a friend and you don't tell him, do you really want to risk that? But if there have been slaves for over 2,000 years, hasn't there always been discontent, runaways? I'm not sure they're sure. When the slaves began to worship the sun, they became discontent again. When did all this happen? You go on believing it, Flavius. All men are brothers. Three against three. We may never get a better chance. I doubt if he'll get very far. He feels ill. All right, but he'll double over before we get very far. Let's go. Captain Merik, isn't it ? I agree. McCoy. All right, what happened? Go on. What happened to your crew? Did they voluntarily beam, come ashore? What happened to your crew? My world, proconsul, is my vessel, my oath, my crew. What happened to your vessel you've explained. What happened to your oath is obvious. You sent your own men into the arena? Do you really believe I could be made to order my own people down? Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, if you have a fix. Stand by, Scotty. Yet on the other hand, my chief engineer's standing by for a message. If I brought down a hundred of them armed with phasers Scotty. Sorry to keep you waiting. Condition Green, all's well. Kirk out. The rules. If Spock should finish his man off first, would he be able to help Proconsul, in some parts of the galaxy I have seen forms of entertainment that makes this look like a folk dance. I've had to select men to die before so that others could be saved. It won't work. Whatever he has in mind, whatever tricks. You hear that, Proconsul? It won't work. I'm not co-operating. I may die, but you won't get any entertainment out of it. Very good. Excellent. I've been in some strange worlds with strange customs. Perhaps this is considered torture here. You'll be the first to know. Nothing except perhaps an explanation. I appreciate that. Of course. I thank you. And my friends? I've heard it was similar. Enterprise log, Engineer Scott reporting. All banks in readiness for disruption of power sources on the planet's surface. Stand back. Obsolete, but effective. They threw me a few curves. No time to explain. And strong personal feelings, he obeyed the Prime Directive. His temporary blackout of the city below resulted in no interference with the society and yet saved the lives of myself and the landing party. Gentlemen. Caesar and Christ. They had them both. And the word is spreading only now. Wouldn't it be something to watch, to be a part of? To see it happen all over again? Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit. Ahead warp factor one."

3355,TOS,episode 54,MERIK,"Well done, Jim. I'm afraid it isn't that easy. They've been handling slaves here for two thousand years. Yes, it's me. This is our Proconsul, Claudius Marcus. This way. Your friends, too. There's lots to talk about, lots to explain. Don't judge me before you know the facts. Come on, we can talk freely here. The Proconsul knows who and what we are. You can leave us. Well, a celebration. A meeting of old friends. This other is your ship's surgeon? It's a pity we can't let him loose in our hospitals. Our level of medicine would improve immeasurably, I'm sure. We had meteor damage, Jim. I went ashore with a landing party to look for iridium ore for repairs, and I met this gentleman. He convinced me it would be unfair to this world to carry word of their existence elsewhere. So I made the decision to stay. This is an ordered world, Jim, a conservative world based on time-honoured Roman strengths and virtues. There's been no war here for over four hundred years, Jim. Could, let's say, your land of that same era make that same boast? I think you can see why they don't want to have their stability contaminated by dangerous ideas of other ways and other places. And as for my men, those that were able to adapt to this world are still alive. Those who couldn't adapt are dead. That's the way it is with life everywhere, isn't it? Just as I did, Jim, you're going to order your own people ashore. They're going to be arriving soon, anyway, Jim. A recon party, then a rescue party, then another rescue party. I had less men. It added up the same. Jim, you've already started a message. Your engineer's waiting. What are you going to do? Ah, that was stupid, Jim. This is not an Academy training test. This is for real. They're taking you to die. Ship's log, stardate 4041.2. Chief Engineer Scott recording. Captain Kirk and his landing party have checked in Most of my men went the same way. I hoped I would feel it less with yours. Maybe now you understand why I gave in. The Romans have always been the strongest, and they've had practice for over two thousand years in enslaving men, using them, killing them. He commands not just a spaceship, Proconsul, but a starship. A very special vessel and crew. I tried for such a command. It's your decision, Proconsul. No, Proconsul. Starship, lock in on this. Three to beam"
3356,TOS,episode 54,ANNOUNCER,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Live and direct from City Arena, and in colour, we bring you Name the Winner, brought to you tonight by your Jupiter Eight dealers from coast to coast. In just a moment, tonight's first heat. We're in a taped commercial, Proconsul. Forty seconds, then we'll be back live. Stand by. Ten seconds. And first tonight, ladies and gentlemen, a surprise extra. In the far corner, a pair of highly aggressive barbarians. Strong, intelligent, with strange ways, and I'm sure full of a lot of surprises. And facing them, two favorites here from previous encounters, Achilles and Flavius. Victory or death? And for which of them? Well, ladies and gentlemen, you know as much about that at this moment as I do because this is your programme. You name the winner. Flavius may be getting off to a slow start, but he's never disappointed this crowd. A close one. The barbarian with the pointed ears seems to be in trouble. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Before tonight's first heat, a simple execution. Stay tuned to this channel. There's a lot of excitement coming your way."
3357,TOS,episode 54,ACHILLES,"Fight, barbarian! Stop running. Fight. Fight, you pointed-ear freak!"
3358,TOS,episode 54,MASTER,"Fight, you two. You bring this network's ratings down, Flavius, and we'll do a special on you. A clear foul, Proconsul. Your decision? Don't move. You'll only die harder."
3359,TOS,episode 54,FLAVIUS,"Don't move! Hands in the air! I said, don't move! Who are you? Where are you from? What do you call those? Are you trying to be funny? Uniforms. Probably some new Praetorian guard unit. I should kill you here, but Septimus would probably be displeased. Move. Move! I didn't harm them, Septimus, as much as I wanted to. There is only one true belief! Roman butchers, sent here by the first citizen. A Roman lie. We must kill them. Septimus, I know killing is evil, but sometimes it's necessary. But they've located us, our hiding place. It's better to kill a few of them than all of us. Almost six. I was there when he became lord of the games. If he is your friend, you are no friends of ours. We'll wait here until dark. You are barbarians indeed not to know of Flavius Maximus. For seven years, I was the most successful gladiator in this province. Yes. The words of peace and freedom. It wasn't easy for me to believe. I was trained to fight. But the words, the words are true. Long ago there were rebellions, but they were suppressed. And with each century, the slaves acquired more rights under the law. They received rights to medicine, the right to government payments in their old age, and they slowly learned to be content. Are they enemies, Captain? Long ago. Perhaps as long ago as the beginning of the empire. The message of the sun, that all men are brothers, was kept from us. Perhaps I'm a fool to believe it. It does often seem that man must fight to live. I will not fight. I'm a Brother of the Sun. I don't mind fighting, but why you? At least defend yourself. Not like that, you fool. Hold your weapon higher. Murderers! If you want death, fight me!"
3360,TOS,episode 54,DRUSILLA,"I was told to wait for you and provide wine, food, whatever you wish. I am Proconsul's slave Drusilla. Although for this evening. For this evening I was told I am your slave. Command me. What will not work? We're alone. Please believe me. I've never lied to one who owns me. I was concerned. I am ordered to please you. Torture? I do not understand. I do not wish to see you tortured in any way. At the first sign of pain, you will tell me?"
3361,TOS,episode 54,SEPTIMUS,"Keep always in your mind, Flavius, that our way is peace. Oh? Are you Children of the Sun? Then are you slaves like ourselves? No. Tell me the empire has a device like that, Flavius, and you may kill them. Otherwise, accept them as friends. Captain's log, stardate 4040.7. On the surface of planet four, system eight nine two, the landing party has won the confidence of what obviously is a group of runaway slaves. They dwell in caves not far from a large city, wear rags, live under primitive conditions. But they are creatures of a heavily industrialised twentieth-century type planet very much like Earth. An amazing example of Hodgkins's law of Parallel Planet Development. But on this Earth, Rome never fell. A world ruled by emperors who can trace their line back two thousand years to their own Julius and Augustus Caesars. No, Captain. I'm sure I would have heard of the arrival of other men like you. There are no other worlds. Lights shining through from heaven. It is where the sun is. Blessed be the sun. Taken from the names of false gods. When I was a senator, I worshiped them too, but I heard the words of the sun. I became a Brother. For that, they made me a slave. My advice to you is to leave. Go back where you came from. Merikus? Merikus is first citizen. Butcher. Perhaps five years. First I must discuss it with the others. We have decided. Flavius will guide you. We will provide you with suitable clothing. I caution you, take great care. The police are everywhere. May the blessings of the sun be upon you."
3362,TOS,episode 54,MAXIMUS,"Hold! Don't move! Hands in the air! Four fleeing fish. A fine haul. Flavius Maximus. You have been too long absent from the games, Flavius. The first citizen will be pleased. Runaway slaves are always welcome. No, not slaves. Barbarians. It's been a long time since I've watched barbarians die in the arena. Captain's log, stardate 4040.9. Uniformed police like those of Earth, a great city like Rome with automobiles. Astonishing similarities to twentieth-century Earth, down to the fine carbon steel in the bars. The first citizen? Why would he bother with arena bait like you? Perhaps? Flavius. Your friends are waiting for you. You've already been matched for the morning games. Come. Put a sword in your hand, and you'll fight. I know you, Flavius, you're as peaceful as a bull. You three come with us. No talking. Outside. Outside!"
3363,TOS,episode 54,CLAUDIUS,"But it was exciting. They'd do well in the arena. But this is no place for a reunion. Prepare food for our friends. They've come from a great distance. A great distance indeed. So, this is a Vulcan. Interesting. From what I've heard, I wish I had fifty of you for the arena. Come. You must be hungry. Gentlemen? Oh, try the sparrow broiled in garum. Delicious. Or perhaps some of this roast kid. Lovely thing, isn't she? Contamination. Can't risk that. Oh, you'll understand as you learn more about us. Interesting. And you, Captain, which world do you prefer? Are designed to circumvent any such order. There may be over four hundred men on your ship, Captain, but they can be brought down if it's handled properly. Say, a few at a time. You see, I have the advantage of a trained ship captain to tell me what is and what is not possible. Your communicator, Captain Kirk. Now do save us all a lot of unnecessary trouble and issue the appropriate orders. I believe this, Captain. That you would do almost anything rather than see these two dear friends put slowly to death. Very wise of you, Captain. No point in sending up bullet-ridden corpses. I do hope so, for your sake. Now, Captain, what are you going to order your men to do? you could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire empire, and violate your oath regarding noninterference with other societies. I believe you all swear you'll die before you'd violate that directive. Am I right? But on the other hand, why even bother to send your men down? From what I understand, your vessel could lay waste to the entire surface of the world. Oh, but there's that Prime Directive in the way again. Can't interfere. Order your officers to come down. Guards, take them. Prepare them for the games. Question, Captain? We believe men should fight their own battles. Only the weak will die. My word as a Roman. Ready to order your men down, Captain? Quite true, Captain Kirk. The games have always strengthened us. Death becomes a familiar pattern. We don't fear it as you do. Admit it. You find these games frightening, revolting. Certain this isn't different, Captain? Those are your men dying, not strangers. You're a clever liar, Captain Kirk. Merikus was a spaceship captain. I've observed him thoroughly. Your species has no such strength. I see no evidence of superiority. They fight no better than your men did, Merikus. Perhaps not as well. Your opinion, Merikus? After all, they're like yourself. Your opinion, Captain Kirk? Would you like me to kill them now? An easy death? Then you'd gladly accept whatever happens to you. Take them back to their cage. Well, it won't go that easily for them, Captain, nor for you. Take him to my quarters. Captain. I'm sorry I was detained. Should we have our little talk now? So far on this planet we've kept you rather busy. I don't wonder you slept through the afternoon. By the way, one of the communicators we took from you is missing. Was it my pretty Drusilla by any chance? See if he has it. Not that I would have punished her. I would have blamed you. You're a Roman, Kirk, or you should have been. It's not on his person? I am sorry I was detained. I trust there was nothing further you required? Because you're a man, I owe you that. You must die shortly, and because you are a man Would you leave us, Merik? The thoughts of one man to another cannot possibly interest you. Because you are a man, I gave you some last hours as a man. Unfortunately, we must demonstrate that defiance is intolerable. But I've learned to respect you. I promise you, you will die easily, quickly. When their time comes, the same of course. Guards. Take him to the arena. Oh, we've pre-empted fifteen minutes on the early show for you. In full colour. We guarantee you a splendid audience. You may not understand because you're centuries beyond anything as crude as television. Make it a quick, single thrust. Guards, don't let him escape! Guards! Hold! We're in each other's line of fire. I pity you, Captain Merik, but at least watch and see how men die. Swords only!"

Captain, something is beaming aboard this vessel. The beam is originating at least one thousand light years away. If what he says is true, Captain, every second we delay him could be dangerous. A most difficult decision, Captain. Quite a lovely animal, Captain. I find myself strangely drawn to it. He did say his planet was hidden, Captain. Current Earth crises would fill a tape bank, Captain. There will be an important assassination today, an equally dangerous government coup in Asia, and, this could be highly critical, the launching of an orbital nuclear warhead platform by the United States countering a similar launch by other powers. Most definitely. Once the sky was full of orbiting H-bombs, the slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident, setting off a nuclear holocaust. He might be inclined to prepare a perfect one, Captain. But then again he may be telling the truth. Following him down is a major risk, Captain. If we ourselves do anything that changes history In here, Captain. Chances are he's out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one of the control centres. Here, let me help you, Sergeant. It's operated with this dial here. I can try, Captain. I can estimate some of this, Captain, but without more time It is difficult to know which is best, Captain. Without facts, the decision cannot be made logically. You must rely on your human intuition. Correction, Mister Seven. It appears we did not interfere. The Enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968. And you'll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons. Captain, we could say that Mister Seven and Miss Lincoln have some interesting experiences in store for them. Live long and prosper, Mister Seven."

There's no way for us to know. We can estimate only within a thousand metres or so where he beamed down, Captain. Aye. Locked in. Proceed one nine five degrees true.   Correlated. Readings indicate a greater altitude. Approximately thirty metres higher, sir. Proceed five metres, two four seven degrees true. There's an old-style weather satellite in orbit below us.

Spock, you're the expert. Can you detonate the warhead from this computer? Spock. I don't know what your job is! You may set those controls so we can't detonate that warhead. Spock, if you can't handle it, I'm going to have to trust him. Go. Our record tapes show, although not generally revealed, that on this date, a malfunctioning suborbital warhead was exploded exactly one hundred and four miles above the Earth. I'm afraid we can't reveal everything we know, Mister Seven. Yes, I think we could say that. Two to beam up, Scotty. And the same to you, Miss Lincoln.

Why should I tell you? Who are you, anyway? With three four eight? Listen, friend, maybe I'd just better call the police right now. Who do you think you are? Okay, I will. Report. Oh. Everything I've done? Well, okay. Well, let's see. Well, how do you expect me to type, with my nose? Did you see that? The machine typed everything I. It's typing everything I'm saying! Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Okay. That does it. I quit! I'm quitting right now! Acting? I'm leaving. Goodbye. Hey. Hey! Hey. Hey, watch it! Okay, I'll bite. What is it? Research for a new encyclopaedia? No? No. Sure, I care. What do you think I am? Oh. Well, what are you guys around here, anyway? FBI? Some kind of government agents, huh? CIA. Very groovy. Yeah? Okay. I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, you guys can't come in here. You can't come in here. Now, get out. What do you think you're doing? This is a government office. Neither one of you can come in here. This is against the rules. What do you think you're doing? You want me to Send the police. Eight Eleven East Sixty Eighth Street, apartment twelve B. No, get your hands off of me, you big jerk! Who do you think you are? Let go! What do you think you're doing, you big jerk? What's the big idea? Mister Seven, help! Help! Let go of me! Stop it! Don't go in there! What's the big idea? Get your hands off of me! I mean it! What are you? I'm warning you, I've already called the police. In there! All right, don't answer, but you can tell him I quit. You can tell him I promise not to tell anybody anything. He's safe, and you're safe, my little green friend. Same to you. No! I'm sorry. I just touched that button right there and then wow! Oh, my gosh! Captain's log, supplemental. Spock and I in custody. Even if we talked, they wouldn't believe us. We're powerless to stop Mister Seven or prevent the launch, or even be certain if we should. I have never felt so helpless. Look, hey, I mean, not even the could do all this. Look, I'm sorry, but like you asked me, I do care about my country, and you can't be CIA. Hold it! Hold it, Mister Seven. I'm telling you, you're through monkeying around with my country's rocket. Hold it! Don't move! You did enough already! Mister Seven, I want to believe you. I do. I know this world needs help. That's why some of my generation are kind of crazy and rebels, you know. We wonder if we're going to be alive when we're thirty. Oh, no. Listen you, get away from him. Please. He's telling the truth. Would you mind telling me who that is? Your cat?"
3729,TOS,episode 55,SEVEN,"Why have you intercepted me? Please identify yourselves. Yes, I heard him, Isis. We're aboard a space vessel. From what planet? That's impossible. In this time period, there weren't Humans with a Vulcan? You're from the future, Captain. You're going to have to beam me down to Earth immediately. Careful, Isis. All right. Captain Kirk. My name is Gary Seven. I am a human being from the twentieth century. I was on my way I've been living on another planet far more advanced. I was beaming to Earth when you intercepted me. They wish their existence kept secret. Even in your time, it will remain unknown. Impossible for you, not for them. Captain Kirk, I am of this time period. You are not. You interfere with me with what I have to do there, and you'll change history. You'll destroy the Earth and probably yourselves, too. This is the most critical period in Earth's history. The planet I'm from wants to help Earth survive. You're tired. Go to sleep. I know, Isis. But we'll be gone before they get here. You're right, Isis. It is primitive. It's incredible that people can exist like this. At least we won't have to. Not for long. Computer on. Specify locations of agents two oh one and three four seven. Simply check my voice pattern. You'll find me listed as Supervisor one nine four. Code name Gary Seven. Computer, I am a class one supervisor. You are ordered to override previous instructions and answer my questions. Computer, I caution you. I have little love for Beta Five snobbery. Override. All right. Agents are male and female, descendants of human ancestors taken from Earth approximately six thousand years ago. They're the product of generations of training for this mission. Problem. Earth technology and science have progressed faster than political and social knowledge. Purpose of mission. To prevent Earth's civilisation from destroying itself before it can mature into a peaceful society. Why didn't you say so in the first place? No, don't answer that. Simply begin search immediately. Recheck all news broadcasts, decode any government intercepted message That's the same kind of nonsense that almost destroyed planet Omicron Four. Progress of mission Has the rocket been set to malfunction? How much time before launch? Computer, record the following. Unless agents are found immediately, I must undertake their mission. Where have you been? Where have you been for the past three days? Where's three four seven? Two oh one, code responses are not necessary. Sit down. I said sit down. I'll say one thing for you. You play your role well. But that is no longer necessary. I'm Supervisor one nine four, code name Gary Seven. I need a complete report Yes, report. Everything you have done for the past three Earth days. Everything you've done. Not with your fingers. Wait a minute. You're not acting, are you? Tie in to computer. Scan unidentified female present. Miss Lincoln. Miss Lincoln, What kind of work did your employers say they were doing here? All right. You can go. Of course, if you do, you won't be helping your country. Unless you don't care about that. I don't know, Miss Lincoln, what you are, not yet. All I know is that my incompetence has made you aware of very secret devices that are vital to the security of this nation. Thank you, Isis. I'll be right in. It's a trained cat, Just like guard dogs, that kind of thing. Don't let anybody in here. I'll be busy. That just doesn't make sense. For them to die in something as useless as an automobile accident. Are the facts verified? Computer off. KIRK; Where's Mister Seven? Yeah, sure, Sarge. There it is. All right. All right. Be careful, lsis. Don't get stepped on. Security, this is Sergeant Lipton, and we're all straightened out down here. Right, thank you very much. Goodbye. All right, Sergeant. Now let's just turn right around. We're going to walk this way. You just sit right down right right there and have a little nap. Yes, thank you. I know how to open it. I know there's not much time. Meow? You are nervous, aren't you, doll? All right. I'm going as fast as I can. What are you doing? I wasn't finished. You must have intercepted the Enterprise trying to beam me on board. Computer on. Lock into launch site scan. Computer, adjustments at the rocket base were not completed. Can I still take over the rocket as planned? Exceiver on manual. Lock into flight telemetry. Visual off. Roberta, please don't try to leave. You'll find all the doors locked. Are you jealous, Isis? It's most unbecoming. Begin malfunction at third stage. Nine zero point zero eight. Visual on. Begin malfunction. Take it off course. Arm the warhead. Exceiver nine one point two one eight. Computer, rocket status. You've got to let me finish what I started, or in six minutes World War Three begins. Roberta, you've got to believe me. Look, a truly advanced planet wouldn't use force. They wouldn't come here in strange alien forms. The best of all possible methods would be to take human beings to their world, train them for generations until they're needed here. Captain, I want that warhead detonated, too. Unless I do it at least a hundred miles above ground, just barely in time to frighten them out of this arms race Captain, he can only guess. Will you please let me do my job. Roberta, be careful. The servo is set to kill. There are only seconds. I'll need time to set it. Computer, go to visual. Count by tens. And in spite of the accidental interference with history by the Earth ship from the future, the mission was completed. So everything happened the way it was supposed to. That, Miss Lincoln, is simply my cat. What else do your record tapes show?"

Interior atmosphere, conventional nitrogen-oxygen. Instruments indicate a transferal beam emanating from the area of the humanoid life form. Directed at the Bridge of the Enterprise, Captain. Fascinating. Activity without end, but with no volition. Captain? Captain Kirk? Captain, there is a definite pleasurable experience connected with the hearing of your voice. Is that you, Doctor McCoy, and are you with the Captain? Engineer Scott as well. Unfortunately, I do not know where I am. A practical idea, Captain. It seems unlikely that I shall be able to get to you. Yes, Captain, I am still here. Have you returned to the Enterprise? I am not certain. I seem to have a body which stretches into infinity. Then what am l? Fascinating. It could explain much, Doctor. My medulla oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing, apparently pumping blood, apparently maintaining a normal physiologic temperature. Why are you endangering your lives by coming here? Back where? Thoughtful, Captain, but probably impractical. While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain. No denigration intended, Doctor McCoy. That skill does not yet exist in the galaxy. Captain, I appreciate the risks you are taking on my behalf, but I must insist they are worthwhile only if there is a reasonable chance for success. Let me ask you, how much time has elapsed since Doctor McCoy must've told you that twenty four hours is the maximum my body can It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills, does it not? Acknowledged. Yes, Captain. I shall give it top priority. Captain, I have an answer for you. It seems your pain bands are manually controlled. The red button on a bracelet releases them. I know that does not make much sense. How very flattering. Fascinating. Indeed, Captain. That is unquestionably part of what I am doing. If I may explain, Captain. She refers to the tape storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place. I scan it. A most impressive store. It is a device with feeding circuits. They lead into the mind of the priestess leader. Its use is strictly predetermined by the builders. She is an alien. The configurations of her brain are different. It could cause irreparable damage to your human brain, Doctor. Captain, you might lose the doctor that way. I cannot allow you to jeopardise your life for me. Yes. Doctor McCoy. If you will finish reconnecting my speech centre, I might be able to help. Yes. That's correct. One thing at a time. Ah, ah, mmm. That's better. Now, Doctor. Try the sonic separator. Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling. Please stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions, one by one. In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct. You will then seal using the tri-laser connector. Ready. Correct. Correct. Correct. Very good, Doctor. Congratulations, Doctor. And thank you. On the whole, Captain, I believe I am quite fit. Fascinating. A remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation. At the peak, advanced beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive level which you saw. And it all began thousands of years ago when a glacial age reoccurred. This underground complex was developed for the women. The men remained above, and a male-female schism took place. A fascinating cultural development of a kind which never As I was saying, a fascinating cultural development of the kind which hasn't been seen in ages.

3758,TOS,episode 56,MCCOY,"Jim! Jim! You'd better come down to Sickbay Right now. Now. Thank God. No, not like this. I don't know. He was worse than dead. Jim. His brain is gone. It's been removed surgically. It's the greatest technical job I've ever seen. Every nerve ending in the brain must've been neatly sealed. Nothing ripped, nothing torn, no bleeding. It's a medical miracle. No. That incredible Vulcan physique hung on until the life-support cycle took over. His body lives. The autonomic functions continue. But there is no mind. What girl? I can't give you any guarantee. If it happened to any of us, I'd say indefinitely. But Vulcan physiology limits what I can do. Spock's body is more dependent on that tremendous brain for life support. Take him? Take him where? Jim, where are you going to look? In this whole galaxy, where are you going to look for Spock's brain? How are you going to find it? Even if you do, I can't restore it. I don't have the medical technique. But I don't know how. If you don't find it in twenty four hours, you'd better forget the whole thing, Jim. Call Chekov and tell him to send my stomach down. I'll have her talking in a minute. She's not, Jim. No change in reading. She doesn't know. Jim, it's no use. You'll get nothing out of that one. Hers is the mind of a child. Where are you, Spock? Where else would I be? Jim, she may not remember or even really know. Disassociation could be complete. It doesn't seem possible she could have performed surgery on Spock. Yes, for instance, above it's cold and harsh. And below, it's warm. The air is fresh. Who are the doctors? Who operates? We just want to talk to somebody about Spock's brain. That's all. Yes. Yes, in a way it is. The human brain controls the individual's functions. It's not possible. I wouldn't believe the human organism could take such pain. I'm sure you noticed the delight aspect of this place. It does, Captain. You are a disembodied brain. Thank you. I told him. Jim.. Spock. No pain. She couldn't, Jim. Her mind is functioning on a very simple level. Mental faculties here seem to be almost atrophied because of non-use. Without you there could be no delicate miracle that kept Spock's brain alive. Yes. From the very first, I appreciated your ability. It would be just enough time. Jim, it worked for her. It might work for me. I'm a surgeon already. If I could learn these techniques, I might be able to retain them. He might, but we're sure to lose you if I don't try. Spock, didn't you hear? I might be able to retain and bring these techniques to the world. Jim, isn't it worth that risk? Wouldn't you insist upon taking such a risk yourself? Of course. Of course. A child could do it. A child could do it. Captain's log, Stardate 5432.3. Doctor McCoy is proceeding to restore Spock's brain. Our problem, we do not know how long his increased surgical knowledge will stay with him. Any additional attempt to use the teaching device is impossible. It would kill my medical officer. I can't. I All the ganglia, the nerves. There are a million of them. What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? I'm trying to thread a needle with a sledgehammer. What am I supposed to do? I can't remember. I don't remember. No one can restore a brain. He's dying, and I can't stop it. Spock? Speech centre. Sonic separator. Tri-laser connector. Ready? Right forefinger. Right wrist. Right elbow. I'll never live this down. This Vulcan is telling me how to operate. Closed. How do I know? I could have made a thousand mistakes. Sealing nerve endings, joining ganglia. The fluid balance is correct, but I don't know. I knew it was wrong. I shouldn't have done it. I should have never reconnected his mouth."

Captain's log, stardate 5431.4. for fifteen hours and twenty minutes we have been following the ion trail of the spaceship that has Spock's brain. Time left to us, eight hours and forty minutes. Captain, I've lost the trail. It's gone, sir. A sudden deaction shift. But that ship, Captain, either it was many years ahead of us or the most incredible design fluke in history. But a technological rating of only three. They couldn't possibly have put that ship we saw into space. I say planet four, Captain. At least planet four is ahead of three technologically. A hunch, Captain?"
3763,TOS,episode 56,SCOTT,"It beats me, but isn't she a beauty? I've never seen anything like her. And ion propulsion at that. They could teach us a thing or two. Aye. Scattered. Widely spaced. Humanoid, all right. On the large side. Aye. Captain! There's someone, something out there in the rocks. Five of them. Humanoid, large. A companion. Aye, sir. Captain! Over here, sir. There's food in there and a whole pile of other stuff. A storehouse for our muscular friends. It could be a warning device to keep those creatures away from the food. In that case, the beam would be a signal. Keep him close to the right. Captain, that power we picked up above, we're getting closer. Enough to push this planet out of orbit. Either a nuclear pile a hundred miles across or Ion power. Aye. Captain, I've got something, but I can't quite get a fix on it. Mister Spock, where are you? Aye. There's no sun, but there's light. That's impossible. Who built the machines? These are on to stay for a while. Must be a magnetic lock of some kind. Those women could never have set up anything as complex as this has to be. Why, that takes engineering genius. But there's no sign of engineering genius in any of those women. Pain and delight, he said up above. How does Spock's brain fit into this? Isn't there a way to correct that situation? Body? Why, you have none. Got it. Must be in there, Captain. That phaser is set to kill. I've never seen anything like it. He's operating at warp speed. I'd like a try at that teacher myself. Captain Kirk! He's forgetting."
3764,TOS,episode 56,KIRK,"What do you read, Mister Spock? Any contact, Lieutenant? Keep trying. Magnification ten, Mister Chekov. Well, Scotty? Interesting design. Life forms, Mister Spock? Directed at what? Security guard. I'm Captain James Kirk. This is the Starship Enterprise. Helm status, Mister Sulu. Condition reports from all decks, Lieutenant. Spock. Where's Spock? Yes, what is it? All right. On my way. Spock. What happened? Like this? What happened? You've got him on complete life support. Was he dead? What do you mean? Come on, Bones. What's the mystery? His what? How could he survive? If his brain is missing, then Spock is dying. That girl. From that ship. She took it. I don't know why, or where, but she must have taken it. Bones, how long can you keep him functioning? That's not good enough, Doctor. Then we'll take him with us. In search of his brain, Doctor. From what you say, the moment we find it we must restore it to his body, or we lose him. I'll find it. It was taken out. It can be put back in. The thief that took it has the knowledge. I'll force it out of her. You and Scotty have Spock ready. Where does the trail lead to? Lock on, Mister Sulu. Maximum speed. No question about the trail? All scanners, extreme sweep. Well? We've lost her trail, but she went into that system. Mister Chekov, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen. Read out, Mister Chekov? She was breathing our air. She must've gone to one of them. Show us the three Class-M planets. Mister Chekov. Earth equivalent approximately 1485. The year 2030. Third Class M planet, Mister Chekov. Now. as I understand it, Mister Chekov, there are three Class-M planets, Not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight, Yet one of them accomplished it. Thank you, Mister Chekov. That's the primitive glaciated planet. The source of it? What do your surface readings show, Mister Chekov? With regular pulsations of generated energy? I can't afford to guess wrong. I've got to choose the right planet, get there, find the brain. Eight hours and thirty five minutes. Recommendations, Mister Chekov. But advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities. It'd be a miracle if they had developed it. Yes. Yes. Why would they want it? Eight hours and thirty four minutes. Planet six is glaciated, you say? But the energy. Regular. It's there. It's real. Have the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down to planet six. A hunch, Mister Sulu. If I guess wrong, Mister Spock is dead. Spock will die. Captain's log, stardate 4351.5. We are beaming down to a primitive glaciated planet in the Sigma Draconis star system. Time left to us to find Spock's brain, eight hours and twenty nine minutes. Suit temperatures to seventy two. Life-form readings, Mister Spock? Mister Scott? Watch out. We know their development is primitive. Read out, Mister Chekov. You have a thick skin. Phasers on stun. I want them conscious. Fire only on my signal. Flank out. We mean you no harm. We're not your enemies, we're your friends. We only wish to talk to you. No. We come from a far place. We are men. Like yourselves. Who are the Others? Do they live here with you? Do they come from the sky? Do they come for your women as well? The female of your kind. Don't you have a mate? Will you take us where we can find the Others? We do. We want to find them. Take us there and we'll let you go. Buildings? Somewhere down there is where the Others live. Scotty, see if you can find a way down. It's all right. It's all right. Let him go. What was it he said, pain and delight? A dead and buried city on a planet in a glacial age. I don't think so. Scotty. Metal. Forged, tempered. Our apish friends didn't make these. What do you think? Or the food could be a lure set by the Others to bring them in here. And this cave a trap. Exactly. Kirk to Enterprise. Have Doctor McCoy beam down immediately. Mister Chekov, you and the security team will remain here at the entrance. We'll be in constant contact with you. All right, Bones. Bring him along. Ready? Phasers on stun. A lot of it? What source? Or what? We're slowing down. Is she all right? Who's in charge? I wish to speak to him. What have you done with Spock's brain? Where've you taken it? You're lying! See what you can pick up on your communicator. We don't want to hurt you. What is this place? Who are you? Spock, is that you? Yes, Spock. Yes. We'll get you, Spock. It won't be long. Quickly! There she is. That's the one. What have you done with Spock's brain? Captain's Log, stardate 5431.6. Immediately after making contact with Spock's brain, Doctor McCoy, Engineer Scott, and myself were taken prisoner inside a highly complex civilisation hundreds of metres below the surface of planet Sigma Draconis Seven. The primitive creature we encountered above warned us about the givers of pain and delight and the frightening consequences of being captured by them. What have you done with Spock's brain? This is Spock. You saw him on the ship. You have his brain. It must be restored to him immediately. What have you done with it? I do not know about Luma, but you were on the Enterprise. I saw you. You came to my ship! I saw you on my ship. No, it doesn't. Sorry. We don't want to hurt anyone. No. We'll stay here and learn about you and tell you of us. I wish to talk to those in charge. Yes, the organisers, the managers. The leader of your people. Who controls this complex? Yes, the Controller. The Controller. Who controls? I would like to meet, to see him. We intend no harm. No, no, no. I promise you. Bones. Scotty. Spock's brain controls Great leader. Great leader! We come from a far place to learn from your Controller. He is our friend. You must take us to him. We beg you. Soon it will be too late. You must take us. No wonder the Morgs are so obedient, and terrified. How is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we've met? They were smart enough to invent these training devices. What a way to maintain control over a man. Yes, I certainly did notice those delightful aspects. But that too was strictly under command of the women. With a communicator, we might be able to find out. This fellow is keeping us from our property. I certainly think that science might provide an answer. Agreed, Doctor. Science will triumph. Come on, Scotty. Bones, give them something to keep them out for a while. Spock. Spock. Come on, Spock. Spock, you were on this frequency, Spock. No. We might be able to locate you, if you gave us some idea of what they were using you for. Is it medical? Spock, we don't have time for that. We came to put you back. Where are you? Back into your body. We brought it along with us. The skill to remove it exists right where we are. Restoring it must also be possible. That's why we've got to get to you as quickly as we can. Eighteen hours and twelve minutes. That leaves us exactly five hours and forty eight minutes, Spock. Yes. Very brief. That's why we must get to you immediately. Beam us a signal so we can home in on you. Bones. Oh, Spock, one question. We've got pain-giving devices attached to us. Can you tell us how to get them off. Oh, yes it does, Spock. Keep concentrating, Spock. Keep concentrating, Spock. You'll find another Controller. Spock, you're in a black box tied in with light rays into a complex control panel. You say you're breathing, pumping blood, maintaining temperature? Is it possible that you're re-circulating air, running heating plants, purifying water? He will not stay. Now, you took his brain. You will put it back. How did you do it? She was on the Enterprise. She must have done it. How did you do it? How do you get the old knowledge? What is the Teacher? How does it work? Show us. KARA; I cannot. You must tell us. How does it work? Show us! We'll protect you. We're not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing. If you continue, you'll kill Spock. But Spock will be dead. His body's dying this minute. No one may kill a man. Not for any purpose. It cannot be condoned. You must help us. When you came to the ship, you had the knowledge. Yet, when we came here, you didn't. How long does the knowledge last? If you had the knowledge, could you restore what you've taken? You must help us. You must restore with that knowledge what you have taken. You must put back what you have taken. Go ahead, Doctor. Put the Teacher on. No. You won't be destroyed. You'll be without your Controller for the first time, but you'll be much better off, I think. No, you'll live and develop as you should have. All this shouldn't have been done for you. Now the women here below and the men here above will control together. There are other ways. You'll discover them. You must move to the surface, you understand. No, you won't. You'll learn to build houses, to keep warm, to work. We'll help you for a while. Humans have survived under worse conditions. It's a matter of evolution. You'll be fine. What is it? Bones? Bones? Bones, you can't stop now. Bones? You could. A while ago it was child's play. Captain's log, supplemental. Our race against time to save Spock's life may prove futile. Doctor McCoy has lost the surgical knowledge he obtained from the teacher. He has been drawing on his own skills and surgical techniques in an attempt to continue the operation, but he is faltering and uncertain. In a desperate hope that he can draw on Spock's brain for assistance, I instructed Doctor McCoy to give priority to connecting Spock's vocal chords. Well? Well? How do you feel, Spock? What's that? Well, we took the risk, Doctor."

No, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. No sign of organised civilisation. Primitive humanoids picked up at irregular intervals. I can't explain it, sir. Sigma Draconis Three. It's closest, heaviest population. None of these planets could. Several thousand years at least. Only the tropical zone is ice-free. What if you guess wrong, Captain? No structures, Captain. No mechanised objects that I can read. No surface consumption or generation of energy. Atmosphere is perfectly all right, of course. Temperature, a high maximum of forty. Livable. Captain, five hundred metres in that direction there's a foundation under the surface. A huge one. Registrations all over the place. Yes, sir. Immensely old, completely buried. But they were here once. What could the Others do to cause such terror? A peculiar mixture. And the male humanoid who doesn't know the meaning of the word female. If it will trap the creatures for the Others, Captain, won't it trap us, too? Aye, sir. It might be a long wait. We may as well be comfortable."

Gentlemen, the Controller's explanation of the functioning of the Teacher is essentially correct. However, he is giving no credit to me. I provide the means whereby the knowledge is used. Without me, Captain Thank you, Doctor. That was very gracious. Good, Captain Kirk. Then you also appreciate that without the Teacher, I would not have the knowledge to use that which you have thoughtfully provided. So it is. That is the knowledge you have brought me. Do not move. If your weapon kills, it will kill you. The Controller die? The Controller will live for ten thousand years, and we shall give him all our devotion. Why do you not understand that the need of my people for their Controller is greater than your need for your friend. Do not! I do not know killing. I do not wish to kill. The commandment must be fulfilled. Correct. Three of your hours. I would not. No! I will not betray my people. The Controller will stay. No! You will have him back and we will be destroyed. We will die. They will not help us without the pain. We will die above in the cold."

4124,TOS,episode 57,SPOCK,"I did give a full report Sensor scan to one half parsec. Negative, Captain. Increasing sensor scan to one parsec. All scanners report clear. Nothing in our immediate vicinity. Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design. A second ship has appeared. Correction, there are now three. We are surrounded. I have a theory, Captain. True, Captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure. It would be a great prize. I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless. If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made. Spock. I understand. Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel. It is no myth. I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a Vulcan. You're being clever, Commander. That is unworthy of a Romulan. It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself. You would not resort to them, Commander. They would prove ineffective against the captain. I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed. The strain of command has worn heavily upon him. He's not been himself for several weeks. As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person. I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision. I'm betraying no secrets. The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable. Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness. I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and the Federation. I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory. He is not sane. I am half Vulcan. My mother is a human. Vulcan. Eighteen years. The question is irrelevant. My duty as an officer is to obey him. I do not desire a ship of my own. Such opportunities are extremely rare. That thought has occasionally crossed my mind. Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately need a ship. You want the Enterprise. Indeed. I am honoured, Commander. Are the guards also invited? Of course. I shall obey your restrictions. It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable. I am ready. The matter is not open for discussion, Doctor. There is no alternative, Doctor. The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue. It is misguided loyalty to resist any further. I was unprepared for his attack. I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip. I am very flattered, Commander. There's no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the Enterprise. It is indeed a very powerful recruiting inducement. A place? I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society. Please believe me. I do appreciate it. Yes, of course, but not just this moment. An hour from now will do even better. Would it not, Commander? I was beginning to wonder. How rare, and how beautiful. But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier. Spock to Captain Kirk. Captain Are you prepared to beam over? Yes, Captain. The cloaking device is in an area near the commander's quarters. It is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorised personnel. What is your present location? Unknown, Captain. At present, I am rather heavily Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should actually stimulate our conversation. I must confess that I too am moved emotionally. I know it is illogical. That will be profitless, Commander. I do not believe you will find it. I assure you I am quite sane. First officer of the Enterprise. What is your present form of execution? Captain's log, stardate 5027.4. Commander Scott has less than fifteen minutes to install the Romulan's cloaking device and get it working. I hope Mister Spock can buy us the time we need. I demand the Right of Statement first. Thank you. I shall not require much time. No more than twenty minutes, I should say. My crime is sabotage. I freely admit my guilt. The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both specific and binding. As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to protect the security of the Federation. Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security. I carried out my duty. There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement. May I continue? Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan loyalty, there is also the combined Romulan-Vulcan history of obedience to duty. One hundred and fifty thousand kilometres, Captain, and closing very rapidly. One hundred thousand kilometres. They should commence firing at us within the next twelve point seven seconds. The cloaking device is working perfectly, and the commander has informed me that even the Romulan sensors cannot track a vessel so equipped. Deck two. It is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger. It was not intentional. All the Federation wanted was the cloaking device. It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel. You underestimate yourself, Commander. Obviously. Military secrets are the most fleeting of all. I hope that you and I exchanged something more permanent. It was the only choice possible. You would not respect any other. Captain, please go. Somehow they do not look aesthetically agreeable On humans."

He'll recover, but he'll need further attention. Inform your superior. McCoy. Chief medical officer. Well, you can see for yourself, he's mentally depressed, physically weak, disoriented, displays feelings of persecution and rebellion. No, not now. Yes, it's possible. Spock, I don't believe it. There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out. What do you mean, the matter's not open for discussion? What did you do? What did you do? Your instincts are still good, Mister Spock. The captain is dead. I left orders that no one come in here. Well now that you know it, you might as well assist me. Hand me the physiostimulator. Spock gave him a nerve pinch to simulate death. I didn't know it until I beamed aboard the Romulan ship. Jim and Spock were operating under Federation orders. That's the Vulcan death grip for you. You took a big chance they didn't start an autopsy. So that if anything went wrong, you would be the one to blame. What for? Sickbay to Bridge. Mister Scott, will you report to Sickbay. You have to. It's urgent. Well, I do. Mister Scott, please. What the devil is Spock doing? What's delaying him? You're taking an awful chance, Jim. Sickbay to Bridge.

4137,TOS,episode 57,SCOTT,"Lieutenant, when did the order come through? From Starfleet. The order to enter the Neutral Zone. Surely the Captain couldn't be doing this on his own authority. That's a Klingon ship! But it couldn't be, not in this area. They caught us right enough. We've not got many choices. If the Enterprise is taken by Romulans, they'll know everything there is to know about a starship. Perfectly clear. Security, put our two Romulan hostages in the brig. Lieutenant Uhura, give me a channel to that ship. This is Lieutenant Commander Scott. The Enterprise takes no orders, except those of Captain Kirk, And we will stay right here until he returns. And if you make any attempt to board or commandeer the Enterprise, it will be blown to bits along with as many of you as we can take with us. Scott here, Doctor. Sickbay? I can't leave the bridge at a time like this. We're surrounded by enemy vessels ready to attack us. I don't know of anything more urgent than that. All right, Doctor. It better be important. Scott out. All right, Doctor, what's so urgent that... Captain? Captain Kirk. Well, you look like the devil himself, but as long as you're alive. What's it all about? They're in the brig, sir. Aye, sir. No doubt of it. But Mister Spock hasn't sent the proper co-ordinates yet. But, sir, what about Mister Spock? It'll have to hook into our deflector shield control. I don't know, sir. I've got that device installed, but bless me if I know whether it'll work. It's the biggest guess I've ever made. I did, sir. It's not working. Captain, I'm working as fast as I can. It's ready now, Captain, but I don't know whether our circuits can handle this alien contraption. It'll likely overload."

Mister Spock. Full sensor scan of the region, please. Yes, Mister Spock, that was the past. I'm concerned with the present. Or is it becoming too much for this crew to present me current information?

I know where the course change takes us. Execute. Better and better, Mister Spock. Very well, Mister Sulu. If you two have complaints, you can bring them out into the open. Sound Red Alert. Man battle stations. Stand by main phasers. Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command. Advise them of our situation. Include all log entries to this point. Mister Spock, your sensors read clear. What happened? Put it on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and complete that message to Starfleet Command. Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. Lieutenant. They want something, or they would have destroyed us by now. It's my ship they want, and very badly. Lieutenant. Save your threats. If you board this ship, I'll blow it up. You'll gain nothing. My first officer, Commander Spock. You understand that Starfleet Command has been advised of the situation? The design of the ship is the same. Mister Spock, you said you had a theory on why your sensors didn't pick up the new ships until they were upon us. If so, Romulans could attack in Federation territory before we knew they were there, before a vessel or planet could get even begin to get their defences up. Well, that's a brilliant observation, Mister Scott. Do you have any other helpful opinions? We have three. We can fight and be destroyed, or we can destroy the Enterprise ourselves and keep her from the Romulans. Or we can surrender. Opinions, gentlemen. Dismissed, Doctor. I said dismissed. Kirk here. Put them on the screen. Put him on. Why should we walk right into your hands? What guarantee do we have they'll beam aboard our ship once we're on yours? Give us your transporter co-ordinates. We're beaming aboard. One final order, Engineer Scott. If we do not return, the Enterprise must not be taken. If the Romulans attempt it, you're to fight, and if necessary, destroy yourselves. Is that clear? Energise. Commander. I'm honoured. Instrument failure caused navigational error. We were across the Neutral Zone before we realised it, then we were surrounded by your ships before we could get back. Accidents happen. Cut off back-up systems malfunction. We were due for overhaul two months ago. The error was corrected. We were not spying, Commander. You're grossly mistaken if you think we were there What earns Spock your special interest? You've been told everything. There's nothing else to say. We've been all through that, Commander! Let her rant. There's nothing to say. That's a lie! Shut up, Spock! You filthy liar! I'll kill you, you filthy traitor! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Did you hear that, you coward? You've betrayed everything of value you ever knew. Did you hear the sound of human integrity? You traitor. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! Oh. My neck feels like it's been twisted off. Ah, but the Romulans don't know that. Sure fooled the doctors. As far as the rest of the crew's concerned, I'm still dead. That's what this whole masquerade was about. To keep the Enterprise and the Federation off the hook. Bones, I want you to prepare for surgery. Yes. Are those Romulan officers still aboard the ship? I'll need a Romulan uniform. SCOTT; Aye. It'll be a pleasure. I wish I knew. Scotty, are you sure we have a clear channel to Spock? Then we can't wait any longer. Prepare to beam me aboard the flagship. It can't be helped, Scotty. Just don't put me inside a bulkhead. Energise. I've just effected an escape from the Federation vessel. I have important information for Sub-commander Tal. Where is he? Good. I shall remember to mention your alertness to him. Return to your duty. Kirk here. I'm already on board, Spock. Do you have the information? Spock, I'll get the cloaking device. Will you be able to get back to the Enterprise without attracting their attention? There's an intruder aboard. Has someone tried to gain entrance there? Over there! There's an enemy spy aboard. He'll be after the cloaking device. Scotty, energise. We'll just have to hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed. Can you do it? You have fifteen minutes, Scotty. The report was premature. We'll discuss it later. Mister Sulu, lay in a course for home. Mister Chekov, take the sensors. Mister Spock is still aboard the Romulan flagship. I want his body readings pinpointed and isolated. That was not a request, gentlemen. Mister Chekov, there's only one Vulcan aboard that ship. He should be easy enough to locate. Feed the co-ordinates to the transporter room on the double. Have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal. Go ahead, Scotty. Stand by, Scotty. Transporter room, beam Mister Spock aboard. The commander? All right. Have them report to the Bridge on the double. Mister Sulu, take us away from the Romulans. Warp factor nine. Scotty, throw the switch on that device. Lieutenant, open a channel to the Romulan vessel. Establish two-way visual contact. This is Captain Kirk. Hold your fire. We have your commander aboard. Break contact! Scotty, we're running out of time. Mister Spock, distance from the Romulan vessel? Stand by, phasers. Commander, you'll forgive me if I put up a fight. Scotty. Throw the switch. Throw the switch. Mister Sulu, come about. Three one eight mark seven. Thank you, Mister Spock. Cancel Red Alert. We'll let you off at the nearest Federation outpost. Mister Spock will have the honour of escorting you to your quarters. Commander. Very good, Mister Chekov. Thank you, Mister Leslie. What is it, Bones? What for? I'm on my way. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

4234,TOS,episode 57,COMMANDER,"Captain Kirk. I don't think so, but we have an important matter to discuss. And your superficial courtesies are an overture to that discussion. You are the first officer? I speak first with the Captain. You may wait outside. The matter of trespass into Romulan space is one of galactic import, a violation of treaties. Now I ask you simply, what is your mission here? A starship? One of the Starfleet's finest vessels? You're saying instrument failure as radical as you suggest went unnoticed until you were well past the Neutral Zone? I see. But you were able to navigate with this malfunction? But I doubt it'll clear you of espionage. Your language has always been most difficult for me, Captain. Perhaps you have another word for it. Captain, if a Romulan vessel ventured far into Federation territory without good explanation, what would a starbase commander do? You see, it works both ways. I hardly believe you are the injured party. Spock, come in. The captain has made his statement. I must admit some surprise on seeing you, Spock. We were not aware of Vulcans aboard the Enterprise. Quite so. Yet there are certain ships, certain officers, that are known to us. Your situation appears most interesting. He is a Vulcan. Our forebears had the same roots and origins. Something you wouldn't understand, Captain. We can appreciate the Vulcans, our distant brothers. I have heard of Vulcan integrity and personal honour. There's a well-known saying, or is it a myth, that Vulcans are incapable of lying? Then tell me truthfully now, by your honour as a Vulcan, what was your mission? It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge. Then there is a truth here that remains unspoken. There is Mister Spock's unspoken truth. You knew of the cloaking device that we have developed. You deliberately violated Romulan space with a blatant spy mission, by order of the Federation. We have not even begun! There's no force that I can use on a Vulcan that will make him speak. That is a fact. But there are Romulan methods completely effective against humans and human weaknesses. Then they will leave him dead, or what might be worse than dead. But I will know your unspoken truths. Attention, Enterprise, I am speaking to you from the Romulan flagship. The Enterprise, under command of Captain James T. Kirk, is formally charged with espionage. The testimony of First Officer Spock was highly instrumental in confirming this intrusion into Romulan space was not an accident. First Officer Spock's testimony was specific that your ship was not under orders from Starfleet Command or the Federation council to perform such a spy mission. It was Captain Kirk who was solely responsible. Since the crew had no choice but to obey orders, the crew will not be held responsible. Therefore, I am ordering Engineer Scott, presently in command of the Enterprise, to follow the Romulan flagship To our home base. You will there be processed and released to Federation Command. Until judgment is passed, Captain Kirk will be held in confinement. You humans make a brave noise. There are ways to convince you of your errors. Take him to the security room. A Vulcan among humans. Living, working with them. I would think the situation would be intolerable to you. To whom is your allegiance then? Do you call yourself Terran or Vulcan? How long have you been a Starfleet officer, Spock? And you serve Captain Kirk. Do you like him? Do you like your shipmates? Possibly, but you are subordinate to Captain Kirk's orders, even to his whims. You are a superior being. Why do you not command? Or is it that no one has offered you, a Vulcan, that opportunity? For someone with your capabilities and accomplishments, opportunities are made and will be. I will see to that, if you'll stop looking on the Federation as the whole universe. It is not, you know. You must have your own ship. Of course. It would be a great achievement for me to bring home the Enterprise intact. It would broaden the scope of my powers greatly. It would be the achievement of a lifetime. And it would open equal opportunities for you. Yes? I'll come there. Attend me. I neglected to mention, I'll expect you for dinner. We have much to discuss. Allow me to rephrase. Will you join me for dinner? Mister Spock. That corridor is forbidden to all but loyal Romulans. I hope that one day there will be no need for you to observe any restrictions. Are you the doctor? Captain Kirk's condition? Then by your own standards of normality, this man is not fully competent. Mister Spock has stated that he believes the captain had no authority or order to cross the Neutral Zone. Could this mental incapacity have afflicted him earlier? Mister Spock, the doctor has now confirmed your testimony as to the mental state of your captain. He was and is unfit to continue in command of the Enterprise. That duty has fallen on you. Are you ready to exercise that function? That's enough, Doctor. As a physician, your duty is to save lives. Mister Spock's duty is to lead the Enterprise and its crew to a safe haven. I've had special Vulcan dishes prepared for you. I hope they're to your liking. We have other inducements. You have nothing in Starfleet to which to return. I offer, we offer you an alternative. We will find a place for you, if you wish it. With me. Romulan women are not like Vulcan females. We are not dedicated to pure logic and the sterility of non-emotion. Our people are warriors. Often savage. But we are also many other pleasant things. As a Vulcan, you would study it. As a human you would find ways to appreciate it. I am so glad. Now one final step to make the occasion complete. You will lead a small party of Romulans aboard the Enterprise, and there you will take your rightful place as its commander. And you will lead the ship to a Romulan port, with my flagship at its side. Yes. Yes, it will, Mister Spock. You do know I have a first name. Well, I do. Would you like to hear it? If you will give me a moment, the soldier will transform herself into a woman. Is my attire now more appropriate, Mister Spock? It's hard to believe that I can be so moved by the touch of an alien hand. Mister Spock, we mustn't question what we truly feel. Accept what is happening between us, even as I do. Not now, Tal. Enter. Locate its source. The cloaking device. Bring him. Full alert. Search all decks. You must be mad. Why would you do this to me? What are you that you could do this? Return to your station, Sub-commander. The boarding action on the Enterprise will begin with my command. If they resist, destroy her. Execution of state criminals is both painful and unpleasant. I believe the details are unnecessary. The sentence will be carried out immediately after the charges have been recorded. You understand Romulan tradition well. The right is granted. It should take less time than that to find your ally, who stole the cloaking device. You will not die alone. Recording the Romulan Right of Statement. Proceed, Commander Spock. Everyone carries out his duty. You state the obvious, Spock. Very well. Your twenty minutes is almost up. I would give you credit, Captain, for getting this far. But you will be dead in a moment and the credit would be gratuitous. Destroy this vessel. I gave you a direct command! Tal! You see, Captain? Your effort is being wasted. Of course. It's expected. You are very generous, Captain. If I may be taken to your brig, I will take my place as your prisoner. Captain. The Federation. And what did you want? And that's exactly all you came away with. You realise that very soon we will learn to penetrate the cloaking device you stole. It was your choice. It will be our secret."

We give you one of your hours. If you do not surrender your ship at the end of that time, your destruction is certain. We will be open to communication should you wish it. The subspace message will take three weeks to reach Starfleet. The decision is yours, Captain. One hour. My commander wishes to speak with you, Captain Kirk. The commander wishes to see you and your first officer aboard this vessel. It is felt this matter requires discussion. Two of my officers will beam aboard your vessel as exchange hostages while you are here. Granted, we do not easily trust each other, Captain, but you are the ones who violated our territory. Should it not be we who distrust your motives? However, we agree to simultaneous exchange. Alien? Are you certain? I must know the source! Commander? Permission to enter. It is urgent, Commander. Commander, we have intercepted an alien transmission. We have, Commander. This room. Commander, the cloaking device is gone. Alert all vessels. Weapons officer, bring main batteries to bear on the Enterprise. We have you under our weapons, Enterprise. You cannot escape. Commander? Helmsman, flank speed.

An alien metal of some kind. An alloy resistant to probe. Readings can't even measure its age accurately. These incised symbols are fascinating. Evidently, some form of writing. Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own. Bearing one one seven mark four. If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes. Every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the problem, perhaps past solution. Yes, sir. They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I believe. All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes. Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here. Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them. Doctor? I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid. Spock to Enterprise. Prepare to beam us up, Mister Scott. We're warping out of orbit. Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon. Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid destruction is minute, but as the asteroid approaches this planet, the angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all. Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and resume the search. Doctor, assume this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid. If we don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid. In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain. In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid has moved from here to here. The longer we delay, the less the likelihood of being able to divert it. Beam us up, Mister Scott. Stress or not, we cannot reduce speed. I do not intend to miss that Deflection point. Objection noted, Mister Scott. Carry on. Full power, Mister Scott. Then bypass the relays and go to manual control. I want full power, Mister Scott. Magnification factor twelve, Mister Sulu. All engines stop. Hold position here. Prepare to activate deflectors. Engineering, maintain full power. Full power. Not now. Activate deflectors. Degree of deflection, Mister Sulu. Recircuit power to engines. Maximum speed heading three seven mark zero one zero. Correct, Mister Chekov. I intend to retreat in front of that asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams. To destroy it. A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will split that mass. Incorrect. We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of impulse power. That, Doctor, is another calculated risk we must take. Co-ordinates, Mister Chekov. That is our target. The asteroid's weakest point. Lock all phasers on that mark. Maximum intensity, narrow beam. I want to split that fissure wide open. Very astute, Doctor. We'll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as Mister Scott can maintain power. Fire phasers. Rig for simultaneous firing, Mister Sulu. Commence simultaneous bombardment. Estimated repair time? {Engineering]SCOTT I've already surmised that. Thank you, Mister Scott. I accept the responsibility, Doctor. Mister Chekov, resume heading eight eight three mark four one. Exactly fifty nine point two two three days, Doctor, and that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way. Another calculated Vulcan risk, Doctor. There isn't time, Doctor. I must decipher those obelisk's symbols. They're a highly advanced form of cipher writing. I'm aware of that, Doctor. I'm also aware when we arrive at the planet, we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue. I believe those symbols are the key. I am not hungry, Doctor. And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks. My physical condition is not important, Doctor. That obelisk is. You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not words. They are musical notes. In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots, use musical notes as words. The tones correspond roughly to an alphabet. Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by a super-race known as the Preservers. They passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow. So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of them. Which has now become defective and is failing to operate. Precisely, Doctor. Spock to Enterprise. We've located the captain. Beam down Nurse Chapel with an emergency surgical kit. Hallucinations? The nurse has given you something to ease the pain. Why were you being stoned? Naturally, since he did not come from there.  Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in abundance. Spock here. Report noted. Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind fusion? I am Spock. You are James Kirk. Our minds are moving closer. Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk. Closer. James Kirk. Our minds are one. I am Kir Spock! His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual. Captain, were you inside this structure? This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative that we get inside immediately. Captain, we do not have much time. If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be destroyed. I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes. That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence. If you could remember your exact words, Captain. It is similar to deflector panels I've seen, Captain, but far more complicated. Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of sequence. I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their proper"

The whole place is an enigma, biologically and culturally. Why, they look like. I'd swear they're American Indians. Shouldn't we contact them, Jim? Tell them? What's the matter, Jim? Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting. Back in the twentieth century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome. It's particularly common to over-pressured leader types, like starship captains. Yes. Leaving? You can't be serious, Spock. The devil with an asteroid! It won't get here for two months, Spock! In the meantime, what about Jim? That may be hours from now. He may be injured or dying. Can a few more minutes matter, Spock? What for? It might also cripple the ship, and we would be crushed by the asteroid. Jim won't be able to get out of its path. You sound like you're cutting a diamond. Well, Spock, you took your calculated risk in your calculated Vulcan way, and you lost. You lost for us, you lost for that planet, and you lost for Jim. And my responsibility is the health of this crew. You've been driving yourself too hard, and I want you to get some rest. Back to that planet? Without warp speed, it'll take months, Spock. Well then what's the use? We might not be able to save the captain even if he still is alive. We might not be able to save anything, including this ship! You haven't heard a word I've said. All you've been doing is staring at that blasted obelisk. I thought you were reporting to Sickbay. You've been trying to do that ever since we started back to that planet. Fifty eight days. Well, you won't read them by killing yourself. You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks. Now if you don't let up, you're going to collapse. Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured, and as for the pressure, that green ice water you call blood Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and guilt. You're blaming yourself for crippling this ship, just as we blamed you. Well, we were wrong. So were you. You made a command decision. Jim would have done the same. My prescription is rest, now. Do I have to call the security guards to enforce it? I prescribed sleep. Musical notes? You mean it's nothing but a song? Were you able to make sense our of the symbols? I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy. That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries. The Preservers put an asteroid deflector on the planet. And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working order, otherwise I need Nurse Chapel. Wife? His brain is unimpaired. Everything else is functionally normally except his memory. It'd take time. We have no choice. What is it? She had bad internal injuries, Jim. No."

What are the odds on such duplication? Analysis, Spock. Any theories about what it is? What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mister Spock? And how much time did you say we have to investigate? You did say thirty minutes? Then let's go. Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this environment. It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la. Mister Spock, is it possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet, one capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector system? Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world into atoms? We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise. What? Oh, nothing. It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated. No problems, no command decisions. Just living. Ah, the Tahiti Syndrome. Let's go take care of that asteroid. But first I want another look at that obelisk. Kirk to Enterprise. Where am I? What place is this? What are these? I feel should know. They're familiar and yet unfamiliar. How did I get here? Who am I? Try to remember.   Who are you? I'll answer anything I can, but as I told you, many things are strange to me. I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning for me here. But I came from the sky, too. Only I can't remember. I can't remember. Wait a moment. He'll be all right now. It's a simple technique. It goes way back. Way back. Miramanee, tell me about the Wise Ones. Not this one. Tell me. Secrets of the temple. The secrets were passed on from father to son? Well, why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger? Ki, Kir No, no, everything is fine. Your land is rich, your people happy. Who could be displeased with that? I can't tell you anything. All I can tell you is that I'm happy and peaceful here. I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before. Why are they so sure I can help them? Yes, but I. I need time to remember. The Joining day? No, Miramanee, there's no one else in my mind or my heart. Name the Joining day. I have found paradise. Surely no man has ever attained such happiness. Get out of my way, Salish. Nobody's asking for your permission. I have no intention of striking you dead. Miramanee. Come here. Miramanee. I'm happy. I'm so happy. If it weren't for the dreams, my mind would be completely at peace. They've come back. They were gone for a while, but they've come back, and I see faces, too. Very dim. I feel I should know know them. I feel my place is with them, not here. I don't deserve this happiness. A gift? What? These last few weeks, my love for Miramanee grows stronger with each passing day. However, the dreams return every night. Fragments of memories. I can almost get hold of them, and then You! A canal. And with it we'll bring the water from the lake right to the lodge. And we can expand the system, and irrigate the fields and double the food supply. Lamp. Preserve. Preserve. MIRAMANEE@ For times of famine. That is why you made the lamp, Kirok, so that I would never know when it was night, and I would be forever cooking. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. That's not why I made the lamp at all, to keep you forever cooking. It's only the wind and the thunder. Why? But it's only the wind. The wind can't harm them. But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky. I don't know how to get inside the temple. We'll go to the caves. It'll be safe there. Take care of Miramanee. I am Kirok! I have come! I am Kirok! Miramanee! My wife. Is she all right? Miramanee. No! Miramanee! No! Miramanee! I am Kirok! I am It worked. Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment. McCoy. I don't know how to get inside. The key must be in these symbols. We've got to decipher them. You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument? Give me your communicator. Tonal control, consonants and vowels. I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within twenty minutes, get out of orbit. Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone. The landing party is expendable. The Enterprise isn't. Kirk out. Miramanee. Bones, stay with her. Do what you can. Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering. More symbols. Can you read them? Spock, just press the right button. How is she? Will she live? And so are your people, Miramanee. If that's what you want. And I'll love you, Miramanee. Always."

We do not doubt the words of our priestess, but these are troubled times, and we must be sure. It is against custom to interrupt a tribal elder at council, even for the medicine chief. Our skies have darkened three times since the harvest. The last time worst of all. Our legend predicts such danger and promises that the Wise Ones who planted us here will send a god to save us, one who can rouse the temple spirit and make the sky grow quiet. Can you do this? Wait. My people are grateful. Only a god can breathe life into the dead. Do you still question? Give him the medicine badge. Miramanee takes the headband with the metal disc from Salish's head and puts it on Kirk. They all salute him. Our people rejoice and wish to honour your name, but I did not know what you wish to be called. What may I tell them? Kirok? Have we displeased you? Then it must be ourselves, the way we live. Perhaps we have not improved as quickly as the Wise Ones wish. But there is something. Tell us. We will change it. You will wait until I walk the holy path to the earth lodge first, to give me time to tell the priestess that you follow and that the Joining will take place. Kirok! Kirok! When the ground trembles the caves are not safe, Kirok. If you do not rouse the temple spirit, we will all die."

There is no sound in the body. There is no light in the eyes. He will move no more. Miramanee. What are you doing? You should be working on our ritual cloak. What do you mean? We cannot go against tradition. But you are promised to me. Tribal priestess and medicine chief are always joined. I wish no other. Miramanee, if you could choose, would you choose me? Even though you be a god, Kirok, I cannot permit this Joining. Then you must strike me dead. You bleed. You bleed, Kirok. Behold a god who bleeds! Behold a god who bleeds! Kill me. Kill me, Kirok, for I will not rest until I prove to my people that you are no god. Why are you not at the temple, Kirok? Soon the ground will begin to tremble. The people need your help. The caves? Surely a legend can do more than that for his people. Well, what do you wait for, god? Your robes? There's the false one! He's false! Then go. Go die with your false god."
4861,TOS,episode 58,MIRAMANEE,"Wait. We are your people. We've been waiting for you to come to us. Captain's log, stardate 4843.6. First Officer Spock commanding. We've been en route to the asteroid for several hours. Our delay on the planet's surface has made it imperative that we proceed at maximum warp speed for a period which exceeds the recommended safety margin. Salish, a terrible thing has happened. The boy was attending the fishnets, and he became entangled in them and sank to the bottom of the river. Lumo brought him up quickly, but he doesn't move. I must see to the needs of the god, as is my duty. There will be no ritual between us now, Salish. It is because of tradition that I cannot marry you. That was before he came. He is medicine chief now. Salish, choose another. Any maiden would be honoured to join with you. You have no choice. Perhaps you would like to bathe now. Tell? But a god knows everything. The Wise Ones brought us here from far away. They chose a medicine chief to keep the secret of the temple and to use it when the sky darkens. There are no lacings. How is this thing removed? Yes. How does this open? His father did not wish to share his power too soon. He died before he told Salish the secret. Well, you came from the stone metal. Did you not bring life to the child? Here there is much time. For everything. The ritual cloak is finished. If it pleases you, I would like to name the Joining day. I'm the daughter of the chief. Tribal law betroths me to our leader. If there is another, I will step aside. God's wish is above tribal law. The sooner our happiness together begins, the longer it will last. Tomorrow. It's a time for joy for all my people. Each time your arms hold me is as joyous as the first. I thought you no longer had the dreams, that you no longer saw the strange lodge which moves through the sky. I have a gift for you. It may make you happy. Wait. I bear your child. And with the power of the lamp. Lamp? Which turns night into day, we can cook twice as much food, and as you taught us, pre Preserve. I act like a stupid child. I have nothing to fear. You are here. It is time. KIRK; Time? To go to the temple. The people will be waiting. To save them. The wind is only the beginning. Soon the sky will darken, the lake will go wild, and the earth will tremble. Only you can save us. If we don't go now, it will be too late. You must go inside the temple and make the blue flame come out. But you are a god. There is nothing you cannot do, my husband. No! No! Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him! He can save us! I belong to him. Kirok could not get back into the temple. I saw him come, come. Kirok. It is true. You are safe. I knew you would save them, my chief. When I am better, it will be as it was, will it not? We will live long and happy lives. I will bear you many strong sons. I'll love you always. Each kiss is as the first. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked. I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise term. Induced by an outside force. The release of bacteria. Or a helpless mental depression and a state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced. I do not know, but it is possible. A valid assumption, I would say. Or the promise of reward. At present, yes. Odd. There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave. Definitely not humanoid, Captain. Impossible to make any specific identification. The readings do not correlate with any known information. I'm not aware of it, Captain. I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be registered on sensors. Are you all right, Captain? Captain, I have extracted the salient portion of Professor Starnes' tapes. Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses. There is another portion, Captain, which I believe you'll find particularly interesting. Unknown. He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent. Except for scenes of family life, games and picnics with the children, that is the complete record. Whatever overwhelmed them must have done so with incredible speed. Otherwise, the professor would have provided details of the experience. He was an excellent scientist and tireless in his pursuit of the truth. Possible, Captain. Evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth. According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi. After many centuries, the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those they had preyed upon. No, like so many legends, this one too has a frightening ending. It warns that the evil is awaiting a catalyst to set it again into motion and send it marauding across the galaxy. I was speaking of a legend, Captain. According to Federation records, this is the first. He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised it, was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship. I am unable to lock on to the proper co-ordinates. It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus. Captain, we are no longer orbiting Triacus. Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet? This bridge is under complete control. There is no need. I cannot obey your order, Captain. Captain, we must get off this bridge. Captain. Jim. Correct, Captain. Where to, Captain? Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger. They are the carriers. They are followers. Without followers, evil cannot spread. Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children. Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it You take from those who do not know you. Why should you fear it? Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognised you too late."

What those children saw is incredible, Jim. The way those deaths occurred, any reaction is possible including lacunar amnesia. That's my diagnosis. Until specific tests can be made, it remains that. Not until the fabric of the traumatisation weakens or you come up with another explanation for their behaviour. Forcing them to see this experience now could cause permanent damage. Come on. It's time to be going. The tests show no evidence of tensions due to lying. They behave as though nothing had gone wrong. They check out sound physically. There are no signs of any foreign biochemical substances to account for their present state. I have no answers, Jim. Well, can't it wait till we get to a Starbase hospital so they can be checked out by child specialists? Well, I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children if you do. Be careful. Or by misleading the innocent. Do you mean the children may be involved? I think I read you, Jim, but as medical officer I must warn you that unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children, you are treading dangerously. They're crying, Jim. I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see. Yes. It's all right. We can help them now."

Or of fear. And you insist their behaviour indicates traumatic shock? A child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead? I can't believe it. Not these children, to this extent. It's incredible. I'll be guided by that opinion, Doctor, for the present. What about questioning them? Accepted, Doctor. Careful. Children. Children, listen to me. It's late and it's time to go up to the ship. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You'll go up with the doctor. Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children. Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be. Such as? What would make the children immune? Then the children would have been exempted by conscious design. And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment. An attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet. This planet is uninhabited, Mister Spock, to the best of our information? Getting a reading? Picking up any life-forms, Mister Spock? Oh, that's strange. That's very strange. I'm getting a feeling of anxiety in this place. It doesn't sound very scientific, does it? But it's strongest right here. Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder. No, of course. That's, that's me. That's me. But what's causing your tricorder to react? Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here. Let's get back to the ship. I want to check out those tapes from Professor Starnes' tricorder. And I am going to question those children. There has to be an answer. We're not leaving here until we find out what went on or what's going on. It could be far worse for them if I don't, and for us too. Well, well, well. You're all having such a good time, I think I'll join you. Is that all right? I'll have a dish, too. A little one. A very small one. It's better than Triacus, isn't it? I don't think your parents liked it very much either. I'm sure your parents loved you. That's why they took you with them to Triacus. So they wouldn't be so far away from you for such a long time. That would make them very unhappy and miss you. I'm sure that you would miss them, too. Now wait a minute. No, I don't think so. It'll spoil your dinner. All right, children, you've had a busy day. I think you could use some rest. Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters. Tommy, Just a moment. I'd like to ask you a question. Come and sit down. Tommy, will you tell me what you saw? In the cave, on the planet. On Triacus. Did you see your father today? Did he seem upset? What about? What was going on that would have upset him? I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends. We invited you aboard the Enterprise. Why would I do that if I didn't like you? Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus? Aren't you upset about leaving your parents? Yes, certainly. I'll take you. Kirk to security. Post a guard on the children. They're to be kept under constant watch. Lieutenant Uhura, any report from the planet security team? Good. Let's see them. Let's see some more of these unscientific hypotheses, Mister Spock. What happened? I didn't see you come in, Tommy. No. We'll probably take you to a Federation Starbase. I'm sorry, Tommy. Marcos Twelve is not within our patrol area. Mister Spock, we'll pursue this in my quarters. All right, Tommy. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy report to my quarters for a brief conference. Mister Leslie? That could be what destroyed him. Misleading the innocent? I wonder. Yes, Doctor. Spock what do we know about the race that lived here? Is that the end of it? Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst? But most legends have their basis in fact, Spock. I understand your diagnosis, Doctor, and I'll respect it. But not to the exclusion and safety of the Enterprise. Thank you. Spock, what other expeditions have visited Triacus? What was it Professor Starnes said about the unseen force? A ship. Yes, a ship for Triacus. But why? By whom? Security detachment. Ready for relief duty on Triacus. Assemble in the transporter room immediately. I'll have some questions for that planet detachment as soon as they're beamed up. I think it's about time we found out whether Professor Starnes' enemy within is on the planet below or here onboard ship with us. Come on. Your tour of duty will last one hour. Be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings. Don't wait to investigate. Beam down the guards. Beam up the security detachment from Triacus. Spock? What's wrong? Why not? That's impossible. If we're not orbiting Triacus, then the men I beamed down are dead. Activate the bridge monitor screen. Captain to Bridge. Mister Sulu, we're not orbiting Triacus. You're off course. I'm coming right up. Sulu! Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think you see on the screen. Set a course for Starbase Four. Helmsman, did you hear me? Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starbase Four. Tell them we're bringing the children there. Tell Starfleet Command I suspect them of being alien in nature, and I want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival. Lieutenant, what are you staring at? Lieutenant, there's nothing there. Mister Spock, you make the call to Starfleet. Mister Sulu, I ordered you to change course. Mister Sulu Mister Sulu, there's nothing there. That was an order, Spock. Complete? Take a look around you. Take Mister Sulu to his quarters. He is relieved of duty. Confine them to quarters. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Yes, we must. I'm losing command. I'm losing my ability to command. I'm losing the Enterprise. I'm losing command. I'm losing the Enterprise. The ship is sailing on and on. I'm alone. Alone. Alone. I'm losing command. I've lost command. I've lost the Enterprise. I've got command. I've got command. I've got command. Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend. This ship is off course. Scotty. I want you to override the bridge navigation system and plot a course for Starbase Four. Why not? Scotty, listen to me. The Enterprise has been invaded by alien beings. Its destination is Marcos. If we take it there, millions will die the way they died at Triacus. No, I'm all right, Spock. My beast is finished. It won't return. Spock, they're not the alien beings. They're children being misled. They're children. They don't understand the evil that they're doing. We'll have to kill them. Captain Kirk. What is it, Ensign? By whose order? Where did you hear this order, Ensign? Now, listen to me. This order is false. I want you and your men to return to their stations. Ensign, listen to me. Ensign, listen to me. This is a false order, Ensign. I know that, Ensign. You have never disobeyed an order, but an alien being is aboard this ship. Ensign, listen to me. You will disobey this order! Starfleet Command supersedes your order, sir! Enough. Take these men to detention then join me on the bridge. The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Twelve. We will not be landing there. The crew does not understand. When we make them understand as I understand, they won't take you to Marcos. Your friend? Where is your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why does he hide? Good. I'm glad you're not afraid of me. But your leader is afraid. What's he afraid of? He's afraid to be seen. And when the crew sees and hears him, they'll understand that he is not their friend, and they won't follow him. Then let him show himself. Bring him out! Let him prove to me that he is my friend and I'll follow him to Marcos Twelve and to the ends of the universe! Mister Spock, playback the chant the children sang to summon up the Gorgan. The time has come to see the world as it is. Come on. I did, Gorgan. My beast is gone. It lost its power in the light of reality. I command again, and I ordered you here. And we know you. Not if we join together to fight you. We're also very strong. Children, I have pictures of some of you on Triacus. I'd like to show them to you. Would you like to see them? Mister Spock, the pictures. So we were told. Mister Spock, the pictures. The children are waiting. Not always, Gorgan. Not this time. You can't hide from them. They see you as we see you. They know what you are. Even the children learn. Don't be afraid. Look at him. Without you children, he's nothing. The evil remains within him. Look how ugly he really is. Look at him and don't be afraid. It's all right. It's all right, Mary. It's all right. It's all right, isn't it, Doctor? Reverse course, Mister Sulu. Set course for Starbase Four, Mister Sulu."

5239,TOS,episode 59,GORGON,"You have done very well, my friends. You have done what must be done. You have come aboard the Enterprise. Now our destination is a Federation settlement. Captain Kirk will undoubtedly choose a closer station. Do not let that deter you. Marcos Twelve has millions of people on it. Nearly a million will join us as our friends. The rest will be our enemies. Together with our other friends who will join us, we will defeat our enemies as we defeated them on Triacus. A million friends on Marcos will make us invincible. No one will tell us where to go, when to sleep, where to eat. The universe will be mine to command, yours to play in. To accomplish this great mission, we must first control the Enterprise. To control the ship, we first must control the crew. You know how to do that. That is your next task. And as you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do. As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do. As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do. Friends we have reached a moment of crisis. The enemy have discovered our operation, but they are too late. They no longer control the ship. We do. We shall prevail. They will take us any place we desire. Go back to your stations. Maintain your controls. If resistance mounts, call upon their beast. Their beast will serve us well. The fear in each one of them is the beast which will consume him. Remember how it was on Triacus. If they resist, so shall it be on the Enterprise. If you need me, call and I will appear. Our new goal is Marcos Twelve. It is our new beginning. We must not falter. Foolish. You will be destroyed. I would ask you to join me, but you are gentle, and that is a grave weakness."
5240,TOS,episode 59,STEVE,I did not. It's coconut and vanilla. They're both white. Chocolate wobble and pistachio. And peach. Yeah? Yeah. Mine sure did.
5241,TOS,episode 59,KIDS,Yeah.
5242,TOS,episode 59,TOMMY,"Hi. Who are you? I'm Tommy Starnes. This is Mary, Steve, Ray, and Don. Yes, they did. Busy, busy. Can we have some more ice cream, please? See what I told you? They all say it. Saw where? You were there. I saw him. Yeah, he was very upset. I didn't ask him. How should I know? He was always upset, just like you, Captain Kirk. You have your reasons. That place? That's for adults. My parents? They love it down there. Always busy. They're happy. Can I go now? I'm tired too, you know. I know the way. Captain, after we leave here, can you take us to Marcos Twelve? But I have relatives on Marcos Twelve. Captain, can I stay here and watch? I'll be very quiet. Hi. What is that? Will we see that all the time we stay here? He thinks he sees it. Very soon. Go to your stations. Mary, you remain here with me. The crew will take us. The crew believes. We are going to Marcos! We are going to follow our friend! But we won't. We don't need him. We're not afraid of you. He's not afraid of anything. He is our friend. No!"
5243,TOS,episode 59,STARNES,"Must destroy ourselves! Alien upon us. The enemy from within. The enemy! Log date 5025.3. Ever since our arrival on Triacus, I've felt a certain growing feeling of uneasiness. At first I attributed it to the usual case of nerves associated with any new project. However, I've found that the rest of my associates are also bothered by these anxieties. The only ones not affected are the children Bless them, they find the whole thing an exciting adventure. Ah, to be young again. 5032.4. The feeling of anxiety we've all been experiencing is growing worse. 5038.3. Professor Wilkins finished his excavation today. Although whatever civilisation that might have been here was destroyed by some natural catastrophe, it would appear that one of the race took refuge in the cave. And, for our efforts, we are becoming only more apprehensive. As if some unseen force were influencing us. I'm being influenced to do things that do not make sense. I even went so far as to call Starfleet Command to request a spaceship to be used as a transport. It was only when I couldn't tell them what I wanted to transport that I began to realise that my mind was being directed. I decided to send a dispatch to Starfleet, warning them. God forgive us. Must destroy ourselves! Alien upon us. The enemy from within. The enemy!"
5244,TOS,episode 59,DON,"I'm, I'm sorry, Captain Kirk. Oh, not yet. That dirty old planet? Parents like stupid things. Guess what we are."
5245,TOS,episode 59,RAY,Not now. What's so good about that place?
5246,TOS,episode 59,GORGAN,"Who has summoned me? No, Captain. I command here. My followers are strong and faithful and obedient. That's why we take what is ours wherever we go. Then you know I must win, Captain. Ah, but your strength is cancelled by your gentleness. You are full of goodness. Such as you cannot be changed. You are like the parents. You must be eliminated. I forbid it. I fear nothing. They would not help transport us. They were against us. They had to be eliminated. You are also too late. The kind ones always are. You are my future generals. Together we can raise armies of followers. Go to your posts! The first great victories are upon us. You will see. We have millions of friends on Marcos Twelve. We shall exterminate all who oppose us! Our purity of purpose cannot be contaminated by those who disagree, who will not co-operate, who do not understand. They must be annihilated. I command you! I command you! To your posts! Carry out your duties, or I will destroy you! You will be swept aside to make way for the strong. Death. Death to you all. Death to you all. Death to you all. Death to you all."
5247,TOS,episode 59,MARY,"You missed me. Come on. Play with us. Come on. Ring around the rosy, pocket full of posy. Ashes, ashes, we all fall down! Ring around the rosy, pocket full of posy. Ashes, ashes, we all fall down! Captain's log, supplementary. We have buried the members of the Starnes exploration party. Everyone has been deeply affected by what has happened here, with some important exceptions. Let's go and play. But we're just beginning to have fun. That was fun. Please do. You weren't there very long. You don't know. Ha. That's what you think. Watch out. Watch out. I'll sting you. Yeah. Aw, do we have to? He sees Triacus on the screen. Will we reach Marcos Twelve soon? They will! They will! He will come if we call him. He's not afraid of anybody."

5262,TOS,episode 60,SPOCK,"Thank you, Mister Marvick. I shall be wearing the visor. It has proved effective for Vulcans. I shall endeavour to keep it under control. Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos. I am First Officer Spock. Captain Kirk, we are ready. Doctor Jones, may I congratulate you on your assignment with Ambassador Kollos. I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience. No one ever has. I was referring to mind-links I had attempted with members of other species. I was unable to accept. My life is here. Spock to Bridge. We have arrived at the Ambassador's quarters. I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the Ambassador. I almost envy you your assignment. Not correct, Doctor, although I am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine. Were you born a telepath? I understand. May I show you to your quarters? I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint. Do call when you are ready. Why, thank you, Captain. On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was indeed fortunate. Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain. What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions. As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you, Doctor. I see, Doctor McCoy, you still subscribe to the outmoded notion, promulgated by your ancient Greeks, that what is good must also be beautiful. I'll escort you to your quarters. I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain. Good evening, gentlemen. Do you know whether he saw the Medusan? Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain. Dangerous insanity. Trying, Captain. Mister Chekov, your assistance, please. We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the lack of traceable reference points. When we exceeded warp speed factor nine point five, we apparently entered a space-time continuum. Impossible to calculate. We lack data to analyse. Our instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us makes no sense. Our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy. Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a return course. We experienced extreme sensory distortion, and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed. And we cannot re-cross the barrier using sub light speed. An entertaining suggestion, Mister Chekov, but not very helpful. KIRK; There is someone else aboard who might be able to help us navigate. The Medusans have developed interstellar navigation to a fine art. Could Kollos function despite the sensory distortion? Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different from ours. Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become Kollos. A fusion. A mind-link to create a double entity. Each of us would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both. We will function as one being. If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose separate identity. A necessary risk. Of course, Doctor Jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link. Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to converse with Kollos. In some ways, she is still most human, Captain, particularly in the depth of her jealousy. Not sufficient. Her telepathic powers are formidable. If it is at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I am doing shall intrude. The Enterprise is at stake. It is not possible for you to be involved. This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's a more important factor. The object is to pilot this ship. That is something you cannot do. Fascinating. Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web. My compliments to you, and to your dressmaker. An elegant solution. but I fail to understand why you apparently try to conceal your blindness, Doctor Jones. This is delightful. I know you. All of you. James Kirk, Captain and friend for many years. And Leonard McCoy, also of long acquaintance. And Uhura, whose name means freedom. She walks in beauty, like the night. Are you surprised to find that I've read Byron, Doctor? In part. That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos. Ah, Miranda. There you are. O brave new world, that has such creatures in it. My world is next for us. Captain Kirk, I speak for all of us you call Medusans. I am sorry for the trouble I've brought to your ship. And now to the business at hand. With your permission, Captain. Co-ordination is completed. Warp one in six seconds. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Position report, please, Mister Chekov. Thank you, Mister Chekov. Manoeuvre completed, Captain. How compact your bodies are. And what a variety of senses you have. This thing you call language though, most remarkable. You depend on it for so very much. But is any one of you really its master? But most of all, the aloneness. You are so alone. You live out your lives in this shell of flesh. Self-contained, separate. How lonely you are. How terribly lonely. So soon? You're a wise Captain. I rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement. And the ways our differences combine to create meaning and beauty. Live long and prosper, Miranda."

5270,TOS,episode 60,MCCOY,"You poor girl. Vulcan is not my idea of fun. I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be. Isn't it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad? Why do you do it? How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness the rest of her life? Will we allow it, gentlemen? To whatever you want the most, Miranda. Are you sure you're well enough to find your way alone? Now, where I come from, that's what we call a lady. Well, she's not just another girl, Captain. Don't make that mistake. I don't know what it is, exactly. She seems very vulnerable. Of course. But there's something so very disturbing about her. Good night, Jim. He's dead, Jim. Captain's log, stardate 5630.8. As a result of Larry Marvick's insane fears, the Enterprise lies derelict in uncharted space. We have no way to determine our position in relation to the galaxy. We are in a completely unknown void. I have the autopsy report on Marvick. Heart action stopped, cause unknown. Respiration stopped, cause unknown. Brain activity stopped, cause. Shall I go on? I mean he evidently could not live with what he saw. I don't think she'll want anyone to intrude in the kind of rapport she has with Kollos. Now wait a minute. I realise that you can do almost anything a sighted person can do, but you can't pilot a starship. I'm sorry, Miranda, but you must be realistic. You are blind, and there are some things you simply cannot do. Please. Do not fight us like this, Doctor Jones. I appeal to you as a colleague. Do not oppose us. She would have told you herself if she had wanted you to know. I respect her privacy. That's not Spock. That's Spock! But, Jim. He's hardly breathing. Help me get him to Sickbay. Unless Miranda can look down into his mind and turn it outward to us, we will lose Spock. Her knowledge of them may be the only thing that could save Spock's sanity, perhaps even his life. There's nothing else to be done. That's different. Marvick loved her. But they weren't rivals in love. Jim, you shouldn't go in there. What'd you say to her? What's she doing in there? You look like you've paid a visit to the devil himself. You have what you wanted most. Well, I'm truly sorry that you're leaving. Goodbye."

5275,TOS,episode 60,SCOTT,"Montgomery Scott, Chief Engineer. Call me Scotty. Aye, indeed. It's a rare privilege meeting one of the designers of the Enterprise. Larry, would you like to stop off at Engineering with me? I have a few things to check and a bottle of scotch says you can't handle the controls you designed. Good night, gentlemen. Ah, there, Marvick. So you couldn't resist a wee wager. The controls are all yours, and the bottle of scotch'll be in your room this evening if you can handle 'em. I don't know! We need some repairs, sir, but the ship is intact."
5276,TOS,episode 60,KIRK,"Mister Marvick. I am James Kirk, the Captain. Yes, everything will be taken care of. This is Mister Spock, my First Officer. MARVICK; Oh, yes, you're the Vulcan. It's all right for you to remain, but you, Captain, and this other gentleman. We mustn't keep the ambassador waiting. If you'll go with Mister Scott, I'm sure the two of you will have a great deal in common. Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to transporter control centre on the planet. This is Captain Kirk. Inform the ambassador and Doctor Jones we're ready to beam them aboard. Kirk out. Are you sure this visor will work? It's your human half I'm worried about. Inform me when transport is complete. Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to all decks. This is Captain Kirk to all ship's personnel. Clearance plans now in effect. Clear passageways immediately. The Ambassador will be escorted to his quarters at once. Thank you, Mister Spock. Notify all hands to return to stations. All right, let's take her out. Warp factor two. I can't understand why they let you go with Kollos. The male population of the Federation. Didn't someone try and talk you out of it? Well, I'm glad he didn't succeed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you. Tell me, Doctor Jones. Why isn't it dangerous for you to be with Kollos? Spock I can understand. Nothing makes an impression on him. You're very welcome, Mister Spock. But no human can look at Kollos, even with a visor, without going mad. How do you manage? To read minds? I don't understand. Oh. Well, I doubt that Mister Spock would don the most revered of all Vulcan symbols merely to annoy you, Doctor Jones. Yes, very interesting. I might even say fascinating, but back to your mission. Doctor, do you feel any way may be found to employ Medusan navigators on starships? It would certainly solve many of our navigational problems. Yes, I think most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness. One of the last of our prejudices. At the risk of sounding prejudiced, gentlemen, here's to beauty. To Miranda Jones, the loveliest human ever to grace a starship. Some more Antarean brandy? What is it? In this room? Who is it? Can you tell? Of course. Perhaps I'll see Sleep well, Miranda. Yes, she is something special. Good night, Scotty. You dressed up for the occasion, Spock. Very impressive. Good evening. Sleep well. Bones, what's troubling you with the girl? I didn't think that for a moment. What else? We're all vulnerable in one way or another. Meaning she's quite a woman. I agree. Good night, Bones. Miranda! Miranda? Miranda! Has the Ambassador been hurt? Who could have done such a thing? Larry Marvick? Why? Captain Kirk to all ship personnel. Red Alert. An attempt was made to murder Ambassador Kollos. The murderer is dangerously insane. He is Lawrence Marvick. Be on the watch for him. Kirk out. Explain, Lieutenant Sulu. Get engineering, Uhura. Can't you disengage power from there, Mister Spock? Put them on intercom. Security to engineering. No. Scotty, where are we? Bones. All right. All right. We'll take you to a place to hide. Where are we? You mean he just simply died. Or what he felt. Damage report, Scotty? Position report, Mister Spock. Then we should be able to navigate back. Explain. Hazards? I could confine her to quarters. I think that could be arranged. I may be sentimental, but this is my favourite place. Earth. Certainly. Try these. Let me see. It's just a thorn. I was hoping to make you forget about this today. You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved you. But someday, you will want human love and companionship. Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with the Medusans in order to avoid human emotion? A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love, Miranda? You're young, attractive and human. Sooner or later, no matter how beautiful their minds are, you're going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself, someone who isn't ugly. Miranda, I meant no insult. Please. Here we are among the roses. A very romantic setting. I wish there were moonlight, too. Moonlight would suit you very well. Miranda, don't. What? Yes, of course. It's the only reasonable explanation. You can't see and Kollos can't hurt you. I think I understand. You said it. Pity is the worst of all. No, that won't be necessary. Mister Spock will make the mind-link. No other decision is possible. If we can't persuade you, there is someone who can. You'll have to take this up with Kollos. For your own sake. Bones, why hadn't you told me? Yes, there's a great deal to respect about that lady. Am I addressing the Ambassador? We don't hold you to blame for what happened, and thank you now for your help. Yes. Mister Sulu, release the helm to Mister Spock. Then go ahead, Mister Spock. Take over, Mister Sulu. Thank you, Ambassador. Mister Chekov, plot a new course. Ambassador, you must dissolve the link. There must be no delay. Spock! Don't look! Cover your eyes! Don't move! No one is to move. Spock? Are you all right? KIRK; Spock? It's all right. You're safe with us now. Vulcan mind techniques. They seem so untrustworthy now that Spock's life is at stake. But does she want to? She's been in there so long. She tried to help Marvick. Marvick is dead. And Spock is her rival. Is that any better? Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy. Whatever happens, Bones, don't interfere. Captain Kirk. No change? What are you doing about it? Which doesn't seem to be much. It's worth a try, isn't it? After all, he's not a machine. Only half. The other half is human. Far more human than you, apparently. If you don't reach him soon, he'll die. But that's what you want, isn't it? Oh yes? You want him to die. What did you do to him on the Bridge? Did you make him forget to put the visor over his eyes? Yes, you know your rival, don't you? You couldn't keep him from making a mind-link with Kollos, something you couldn't do yourself! With my words, I'll make you hear such ugliness as Spock saw when he looked at Kollos with his naked eyes! The ugliness is within you! Your desire to see Kollos is madness! You can never see him. Never. But Spock saw Kollos, and for that he must die. The smell of hatred, the stench of jealousy permeates you. Why don't you strangle him while he lies there? Kollos knows what's in your heart. You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to Kollos. Maybe too much. You may be right, Bones. Maybe I shouldn't have gone in. She was blind, really blind. Really in the dark. And if he dies. If he dies, how do I know that I didn't kill him? How do I know that she can stand to hear the truth? Spock. Miranda. I didn't think you'd even talk to me. Miranda, good luck, Health. I have something for you. I never met a rose that didn't. Peace. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

5634,TOS,episode 60,MIRANDA,"I'm Doctor Jones. The ambassador is most honoured to meet you, Mister Spock. Thank you, but the assignment's not yet definite. It will depend upon my ability to achieve a true mind-link with the Ambassador. I wasn't aware that anyone had ever achieved a mind-link with the Medusans. I've heard, Mister Spock, that you turned down the assignment with the Ambassador. I'm sure the Ambassador would be charmed. I see in your mind that you are tempted to take my place. Yes. That is why I had to study on Vulcan. I think I'll stay here a bit. Ambassador Kollos often finds the process of transport somewhat unsettling. What is it he sees when he looks at you? I must know! They, Captain? Now that you ask, yes. Thank you, Captain. I spent four years on Vulcan studying their mental discipline. Joy can be many things, Doctor. On Vulcan, I learned to do things impossible to learn anywhere else. How not to read them, Captain. Vulcan was necessary to my sanity. Indeed? The key is the mind-link that I learned on Vulcan. Once we have learned the technique of forming a corporate intelligence with the Medusans, the designers, that's where Larry comes in, can work on adapting instruments. How can one so full of joy and the love of life as you, Doctor, condemn yourself to look upon disease and suffering for the rest of your life? Can we allow that, gentlemen? There's somebody nearby thinking of murder. It's gone now. It isn't there anymore. Captain, would you mind if I said goodnight? Thank you, gentlemen. You make a choice impossible. Please, stay and enjoy yourselves. It was a delightful dinner. Of course, Doctor McCoy. Please don't worry about me. Who is it? It's late. All right. Come in, then. I rather enjoyed it. I'll be further away than that soon. Now, we've been over this time and time again. Larry, please, try to understand. I've been honest with you. I simply cannot love you the way you want me to. And I'm going away with Kollos. That's final. I think you'd better leave now. So it's you! I didn't know that it was you before. Who is it you want to kill, Larry? Is it me? You mustn't keep this to yourself. I want to help you. No harm has come to the Ambassador, Captain. Larry Marvick. Yes, he did. I'll go with you. I must. I can reach his mind. Yes, Larry. I'm here. I am here, Larry. No. I can see what he sees. No, don't. Don't think of it! I've never been to Earth. What lovely flowers. May I touch them? They have no scent. It doesn't hurt anymore. I didn't want his love. I couldn't return it. Shall I tell you what human companionship means to me? A struggle, a defence against the emotions of others. At times, the emotions burst in on me. Hatred, desire, envy, pity. Pity is the worst of all. I agree with the Vulcans. Violent emotion is a kind of insanity. Perhaps. Ugly. What is ugly? Who is to say whether Kollos is too ugly to bear or too beautiful to bear? I see you're a very complicated man. Kollos, no. You mustn't let him! Let me go. You have no idea what a dangerous thing Spock is planning. We must stop him! Let me go! Why? I've already committed myself to mind-link when Kollos and I reach the Medusan vessel. Why put yourself in jeopardy? Then teach me to operate the ship. I can memorise instantly. Pity, which I hate. Do you think you can gather more information with your eyes than I can with my sensors? I could play tennis with you, Captain Kirk. I might even beat you. I am standing exactly one metre, four centimetres from the door. Can you judge distance that accurately? I can even tell you how fast your heart is beating. No. I won't let you. No. It seems I have no choice but to obey you. Captain's log, supplementary. Our one chance to return to our own galaxy is dependent upon the navigational skills of the Medusan ambassador. With that end in view, Kollos has been brought to the bridge and placed behind a protective shield. 'Tis new to thee. Who is it? Doctor McCoy? Who's there? I have no news for you, Captain. Only that his life processes are ebbing. Why, what I can, of course. No doubt you think I can wake him with a kiss. But he is a Vulcan. Face reality, Captain. His mind has gone down almost too far even for me to reach! That's a lie! You're insane! That's a lie! Liar! Sadistic, filthy liar! Don't say anymore, please! Please go away! Now, Spock, this is to the death. Or to life for both of us. I am one with Kollos. We come to the end of an eventful trip, Captain. Well, I have you to thank for my future. Your words enabled me to see. I suppose it has thorns. I know now the great joy you felt when you joined minds with Kollos. I understand, Mister Spock. The glory of creation is in its infinite diversity. Peace and long life, Spock."
5635,TOS,episode 60,IDIC,
5636,TOS,episode 60,MARVICK,"Captain, what are you doing here? You'll have to leave before the Medusan ambassador arrives. Mister Spock, do you have the visor? You must be sure to wear it. Humans who get even a glimpse of Medusans have gone insane. And the reverse, of course, that what is beautiful is automatically expected to be good. Very special. I suggest you treat her accordingly. I've known Doctor Jones long enough to be aware of her remarkable gifts. Well, it's been a long day for me. Some other time. Miranda? Larry. I've got to talk to you. Please, Miranda, it's important. I thought the dinner was never going to end. Yes, I know you did. I didn't. You were so far away. Please don't talk of that. There's so little time. Please, Miranda, don't go with Kollos. Don't I know it. I've asked you in restaurants, in the laboratory, on one knee, on both knees. Miranda, how can you do this? I understand that you're a woman and that I'm a man, one of your own kind, and that Kollos will never be able to give you anything like this. Why did I ever meet you? Miranda. So now you want to help me. Now I know what a mere human male has to do to get a reaction out of you. Make you think he's a patient. The great psychologist. Why don't you try being a woman for a change? Where's Mister Scott? We mustn't sleep! They come in your dreams! That's the worst! They suffocate in your dreams! We're making it out of here! We'll be safe at the boundaries of the universe! We'll be safe! Beyond the boundaries of the galaxy. We made it. We're safe. We're safe, Captain Kirk. Oh, no. No! No, Captain. We mustn't sleep. No! No! No, they come in your dreams. That's the worst. They suffocate in your dreams. No! No. No. KIRK; Come on. We must stay here with the controls. Ready to speed. Speed! Speed to the next galaxy. Miranda? Miranda, you're here. With me. I didn't lose you. Oh, my beautiful love, I thought I'd lost you. Liar! Liar! Deceiver! You're not alone! You brought it with you. It's here. It's here. You brought it with you! Liar! Liar! Liar! Don't love her! Don't love her! She'll kill you if you love her! I love you, Miranda."

It has made several course changes corresponding with our own. Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us. Indeed. Vulcan, Captain. Unquestionably. Most impressive. True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned. No recorded contacts. If they ever ventured into space, they evidently withdrew immediately. I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be little choice. Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area. Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit is not functioning. No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function. Apparently that Melkotian buoy Fascinating. Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American frontier town, circa 1880. Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era. Crude but dangerous. Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern. He looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for our punishment. Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution. Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us. Are they really? Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history. The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector of America. the United States of America, that is. And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out. History cannot be changed. Is this a dead man, Doctor? Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately. Without moving a muscle of either hand. If I remember correctly, that would involve you in what was called the fast draw. It initiated unfortunate events. I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mister Chekov. I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely closely. The day is still young, Ensign. And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon. Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours. Mister Chekov is involved, Captain. It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town. There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor. I could make a device to deliver it on target. I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding. I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade. And it is not yet our time. Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us. Specifically, our future. I understand the feeling, Captain. My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor. Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human. Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused. Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You, Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not? But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK Corral? Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived. Another hour. Not precisely. It should. Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain. It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device. Then perhaps we could quiet things down. These crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well. Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor. Captain? Right now. It has not been tested. But this is painless. Fascinating. Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but it must function. A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function, which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order. That may not be necessary. A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored. Existence cannot be without them. I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction. The tranquilliser you created should have been effective. Exactly. Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov? Wrong. His mind killed him. Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality. All of this is unreal. But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses. Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by its rules. We judged the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real, therefore they can kill. He may indeed be dead. We do not know. Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me. Precisely. The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you. Very well, sir. Engineer? Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are illusions only. Shadows without substance. They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist. Captain. Captain, the Melkotian object. The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable nature, Captain. Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain. Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems too personal. This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you? But he wanted to, Doctor. Yes, Captain. Mankind, ready to kill. I wonder how humanity managed to survive."

5659,TOS,episode 61,MCCOY,"I knew it had to happen. It's a fine time for that transporter mechanism to break down. It's just bits and pieces. It's incomplete. In the midst of what seems so unreal, the harsh reality. This is not a dream. Tombstone. Hell for leather, right out of history. What's the matter with us? We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881. Very dead, Mister Spock. What's the matter? Taos Lightning straight bourbon. Try some. In small amounts, it was considered medicinal. Take it easy, Mister Scott. I hate to think what that stuff's doing to your stomach lining. Or a communicator. It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly four fifty nine thirty. Well let's get there. Mister Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying to find a way out of here, and quit explaining why we can't get out of here. A tranquilliser. Of course, Jim. I can make a tranquilliser! I know the place to get the proper drugs. I'll need a mortar and a pestle. Well, thank you. Mind if I look around a bit? Crude, but very useable. Oh, you don't have to worry. I know how to handle this. I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug, too. Oh, so you're the dentist. Well, I'm a physician, and I have a serious emergency. I wonder if you mind if I borrow a small quantity of this. My name is McCoy. I'm a doctor. The emergency is real. I need these things. That is my intention, Doctor. There's nothing I can do, Jim. Let it go, Jim. He's dead. We all knew the risk when we joined the service. Now let it go. You talk about another man's feelings. What do you feel, Spock? Because there are no feelings to discuss. Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty. It's human. We don't have much time. Get to the point, Spock. I'll have it ready before Spock. And if we fight them, we all die. We know that. I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this. Three or four seconds. It's not necessary, Captain. It's very simple. Nothing can go wrong. It would. Guaranteed. It should have worked. Did you inhale the gas, Scotty? You still feel all right? No dizziness? No sweating? No palpitations? Nothing could go wrong, Captain. It should work. You don't have to worry about that now, Jim. Look at the clock. Then we'd better become experts, and fast. What do you mean, Spock? A piece of lead in his body. Come on, Spock. If you've got the answer, tell us. What do you mean unreal? I examined Chekov. He's dead. But that's not possible. There'd always be some doubt. We're just human beings, Spock. We don't have that clockwork ticker in our head like you do. We can't turn it on and off. They do not exist. Unreal. Appearances only. They are shadows. Illusions. Nothing but ghosts of reality. They are lies. Falsehoods. Spectres without body. They are to be ignored. SPOCK Neither do I. He's in perfect health. But he didn't kill, Mister Spock."

5664,TOS,episode 61,SCOTT,"Impossible, Doctor McCoy. My transporter was working perfectly. And these, Captain? It's impossible! Things like this can't happen. Absolutely. Half a gallon of scotch. It just takes a bit of getting used to, Captain. Actually, a man could grow quite fond of this stuff. Aye. If we only had a phaser. If we could only contact the Enterprise. We have these, Captain. Aye. Captain, let me. Captain, we can't just stand here and take it. But they murdered Chekov! If you think I'm going to Mister Spock, Chekov is dead! I say it now, and I can hardly believe it. But you worked closely with him. That deserves some memorial. Would a volunteer solve the problem? All right. On one condition. That I'm wide awake and with you at five o'clock. Aye. It's to kill the pain. Well, you should've warned me sooner, Mister Spock. Fire away. Aye. Deeply. I never felt better. Good. If they want a fight, let's gie'em a fight."
5665,TOS,episode 61,KIRK,"Steady as she goes. Phaser crew, stand by. Sensor readings? Analysis, Science Officer? Thank you, Science Officer. Come to one eight one mark seven. It's staying with us. Full stop, Mister Chekov. Hold your position. English. Interesting. Telepathy. Our orders are very clear. We're to establish contact with the Melkotians at all costs. What previous contacts have been made with the Melkotians? Lieutenant, hailing frequencies. This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. We've contacted your buoy and understand its message. We hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you. Lieutenant, answer? Try again. Opinion, Mister Spock? None whatsoever. Mister Chekov, deflectors at full intensity. Increase speed to achieve planet fall as scheduled. Lieutenant Uhura, advise Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scott to meet me in the transporter room. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, let's go find out what it is they're afraid of. Captain's Log, stardate 4385.3. We have transported down to the Melkotian planet and have encountered conditions which are completely contrary to what we were prepared for. Spock, what is this? Tricorder readings, Mister Spock? Then let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. We come in peace, but we'll defend ourselves if necessary. Spock, evaluation? Or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of our death. Beautiful specimen. Whatever the Melkotians have planned for us, it won't be pleasant. These could be useful. Just remember one thing. To individuals at close range, these could be as deadly as phasers. October 26, 1881. Tombstone, Arizona. But why here? And why now? Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier. There's something about that date, October 26, 1881 But what was it? Looks like we did. You know us? I'm a barrel of laughs. Johnny? He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom, and Billy. Ike Clanton, Tom and Frank McLowery, Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton. In the late nineteenth century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone. The Earps, Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday. The Clantons lost, Mister Chekov. We are the Clantons. And if this is a replay of history That's one thing we can be sure of. Death is real. Yes, of course. The man who kills on sight. Morgan Earp. Good old Virgil. We can always count on him. I don't think we're going to have any choice. No, no, no. All right, all right, all right. We don't want any trouble. Just leave us alone, Mister Earp. That's all we ask. I guess so. Er, Mister Chekov? Young lady. Young lady. I'd like to talk to Mister, to Billy alone, if you don't mind. Mister Chekov, you be careful. Mister Spock, except for our hand guns, we haven't changed, not even our clothing, yet these people see and hear us as the Clantons. All right, what have we got? We're here in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26, 1881. The day of the gunfight at OK Corral. And we're the Clantons, and Morgan Earp has just gone to tell his brothers we're here. Well, we're not going to be at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon. You, bartender. Ed. You, er, you claim you know us. Take a close look at me. Who do you think I am? I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. These men are part of my crew. We're not really here, we're from the future. We haven't been born yet. Feel the material in my shirt. Now feel the material in your own shirt. Do you notice any difference? Do these clothes look like yours? Have you seen clothes like this before? Where? I'm not joking. I'm not joking! I'm not Ike Clanton! Good morning, gentlemen. My name's James Kirk. I'm afraid there's been some sort of misunderstanding. Yes, of course you did, and I wanted to talk to you about that. There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding. Yes. We'd be glad to. We don't want to fight. I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mister Earp. My name is not Clanton, it's Kirk. I'm not joking. Not me, Mister Earp. We don't want any trouble. We'll be glad to co-operate. What do you call that stuff? Fire? Label it for external use Only. And your reflexes. We're going to need fast reflexes from now on. There's no negotiating with the Earps. We know that. Could we make a communicator? The problem is clear, Spock. We're going to have to seek contemporary solutions. Where's Chekov? Mister Chekov, I mean Billy. Come along. Gentlemen. To exercise the better part of valour. Well, that settles that. A force field. Mister Chekov. If you were in charge of the Enterprise, what would you be doing? Very good. If we could find the place where we beamed down, the ship might lock in and beam us up. It could be anywhere within a thousand mile radius. We have until five o'clock to find that way. Now consider this. What materials were on hand in 1881 that could help us fight the Earps on their own terms? No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us. We have to find a way to put the Earps out of action. Is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap? Bones, the venom, the plants. Can you make use of them? First, Bones, the ingredients you require. Chekov, mortar and pestle. How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target? Cotton wadding. Try the apothecary. No. Yes, we can. Scotty, they're trying to push us into something we're not ready for. Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning. But not this minute, Spock. It takes us a little longer. Bones, Scotty. About what? William Claiborne, that's right. Yes. Yes, that's right. That means it doesn't have to happen the way it happened. We can change it. Bones, how's the tranquilliser coming? Spock? And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade? Forget precision. Will it work? Make sure it does, Spock. If we don't tranquillise them, we'll have to fight them. But not with the Earps. I've tried that. That's out. There must be a way. History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead. That means there must be a way to change this history. Not with the Earps. There is one other place I can try. Yes, Sheriff. I want you to stop the fight. I do now. How else is he going to get justice? It's not too late. Sheriff. Sheriff. There must be plenty of decent people in town who don't like the Earps. Let's organise them. Then the people had better wake up and let the law work for them. Yes, I want revenge. I want to crush the life out of the Earps. But I can't just kill them. Can't I get it through your stupid head? I can't just kill them! I can't murder them! I can't kill them! I can't kill them! How soon will that be ready? Good. How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect? How did you manage to test it? Up to now, everything has gone wrong. I want it tested now. It doesn't work. It was our last chance. We need a weapon. An answer. Ten minutes and it's all going to end at the OK Corral. Well, we're going to wait right here until well after five o'clock. We're not going to move from this spot. Let's get out of here. Scotty, Bones. We're trapped. They got their way. We've got to stand and fight. They're experts at gunfighting. We don't have a chance. Spock, you've got something? It would've been effective anywhere else. Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him. But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation. If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us. We must all be as certain as you are, Mister Spock, to save our lives. We must. Spock, a Vulcan mind meld. Right here, it seems. Do you remember anything else? Good. Perhaps that explains why he's here. Nothing was real to him except the girl. Sensor readings. Lieutenant, sound Red Alert. Mister Chekov, deflector shields on full. Phaser gun crews, lock on target. Phaser guns, stand by to fire. Damage report, Lieutenant. It is. We fight only when there's no choice. We prefer the ways of peaceful contact. I speak for a vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing. We have sought you out to join us. Our mission is still one of peace. Excellent. Lieutenant, cancel Red Alert. Mister Chekov, resume original course, warp factor two. I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mister Spock. Is that the way it seemed to you, Mister Spock? Mister Spock, you're absolutely right. That's exactly the way it was. That's the way it was in 1881. We overcame our instinct for violence. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Aye, aye, sir. Aye, sir. It was Russian, sir. Every word. Aye, sir. Standard orbit in five minutes. Then what are we doing here? Where are we now, Captain? Who won? And we are the Clantons? Oh, you knew that? And pass up an opportunity to see you? Don't be silly. Get your hands off her. What can I do, Captain? You know we're always supposed to maintain good relations with the natives. I don't think that's such a bad thing, Captain. With his outdated weapon? If he shoots at me, I will just step out of the way. A lot of people and things have tried to kill me. You'd be surprised. Yes, sir. Where are we going, Captain? Yes, but where is the Enterprise? I'd be using the ship's sensors trying to locate us. All those western Cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus plants. Sylvia! Hello. That's very nice. That's just what I was preparing to inquire. Have you been shopping? No, no, I haven't forgotten. I am looking forward to it most eagerly. Married? I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible. But it is absolutely impossible. I am not someone you can marry. If only I could make clear to you what I really am. Mister Earp. Get your hands off her. Captain, I don't understand. What happened? Where have I been? But that girl. She was so beautiful. So real. No. It's, it's gone, sir. Warp factor two, sir."

It's taking crazy chances with Morgan Earp right in the same room. I wish it was all over. I saw Virgil out patrolling this morning. They've been blowing off all over town about how they chased the Clantons out. I guess you'll show them now, won't you? Billy, you were wonderful. Yes, Ike? All right. I understand. Billy Claiborne, you be careful. You shouldn't have come back to town, Billy. Morgan'll kill you because he wants me. You can joke about it. I've seen them in action. Especially Morgan. Billy? Please, don't even go near him. Ahem.  Billy Claiborne, you know how crazy I am about you. Well, aren't you going to ask me what I've got in my shopping bag? Of course, silly! What else would I be doing on a beautiful afternoon with the dance only one week away? Or have you forgotten that already? You will be absolutely wild when you see me in the new gown I'm going to make. I found this most scrumptious material, yards and yards of it. You know what I was thinking, Billy? I was thinking what a beautiful wedding gown it would make. Why don't we just turn that dance into a wedding ball? It would be so heavenly. But I'm positive the gown will be ready. What else is there to stop a wedding? Do you think I don't know? Billy Claiborne, you are a cattle rustler and a horse thief and I don't care what else."

You can talk that way after what the Earps did to Billy today? Nobody in this town will deny you your right to your revenge. You listen to me. Get down to the OK Corral. Keep out of sight.

6046,TOS,episode 62,SPOCK,"Spock here, Captain. Sensors have picked up a Klingon ship, closing fast. Captain, the enemy ship is drifting, totally disabled. And we never fired upon her. Here, Captain. Understood, Captain. Transporter room. Our landing party is intact, Doctor. First group from the Klingon vessel, Captain. At the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on Beta Twelve A, the Klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers. Moreover, they also were apparently attracted by a distress call. Our log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present situation. Sensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range, Captain. Captain, neither the Klingon technology nor ours, is capable of this. The instantaneous transmutation of matter. I doubt that they are responsible. None. However, if they had such power, would they not have used it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves? Scans indicate that our forces and those of the Klingons are exactly equal at thirty eight each. The Klingons control deck six and starboard deck seven, while we control all sections above. Most curious, Captain. There appear to be more life-energy units on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the Enterprise crew plus the Klingons. A considerable discrepancy. I shall attempt a compensatory reading of Klingon units. No additional Klingons detected, Captain. It is an alien life force, a single entity. I cannot ascertain its location. Readings being diverted to the library computer for analysis. Computer report. What purpose? If the alien is creating these events, Captain, it is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind. Captain, I am constrained to point out that since minds are evidently being influenced, we cannot know at this moment whether our own memories are completely accurate and true. An appropriate choice of terms. However, it is notoriously difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons once blood has been drawn. We are attempting to end it, Doctor. By reason, preferably. There is an alien on board which may have created this situation. Easy, Mister Scott. May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans? I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant. Fascinating. The result of stress? Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons. Apparently, it is by design that we fight. We seem to be pawns. It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately, and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities. Sensors may be operating. Alien detected in the engineering section, near reactor number three. Jim, he's not responsible. It would appear that the entity wants us alive. Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers. I understand, Doctor. I, too, felt a brief surge of racial bigotry. Most distasteful. Totally unfamiliar. Fascinating. During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy level increased. When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy. This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of hostility, violent intentions. To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation in order to satisfy that need. It has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict. Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The fighting must end and soon. The alien is affecting his mind, Captain. Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it. There's nothing we can do about it. We have nine minutes, fifty three seconds to power zero. There is, of course, a logical alternative. Kang's wife is, after all, our prisoner. Perhaps a threat. Eight minutes, forty two seconds. It has rarely been done because of the danger involved. Pinpoint accuracy is required. If the transportee should materialise inside a solid object, a deck or wall. No one can guarantee the actions of another. Your automatic setting is laid in, Captain. When transporter is energised, you will have eight seconds to get to the pads. You'll know in seven point nine seconds, Captain. Those who hate and fight must stop themselves, Doctor. Otherwise, it is not stopped. All fighting must end, Captain, to weaken the alien before our dilithium crystals are gone. The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain. I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon."

There are rules, even in war. You don't keep hacking at a man after he's down. Hand me that numanol capsule. Truce? Are you serious? I've got men in Sickbay, some of them dying. Atrocities committed on their persons, and you talk about making peace with these fiends? If our backs were turned, they'd jump us in a minute. And you know what Klingons do to prisoners. Slave labour, death planets, experiments! While you're talking, they're planning attacks. This is a fight to the death. We'd better start trying to win it! Who cares what started it, Mister Spock. We're in it! Murderers. We should wipe out every one of them! How many more men must die before you two begin to act like military men instead of fools? Brain waves show almost paranoid mania. What happened? Orderly. Jim. Johnson's heart wound is almost healed. Same with the other casualties. Sword wounds in the vital organs, massive trauma, shock. They're all healing at a fantastic rate.

All subspace frequencies have been blocked, and there's too much radiation coming from that Klingon ship. It's a hazard to the vicinity. Transporter room to Bridge. Klingon ship is vacated, sir. I would if I could, sir. The controls have gone crazy. Something's taken over. The engines, sir. They've gone to warp nine, by themselves! Three hundred and ninety two trapped below decks. The doors and bulkheads won't budge. We'll have to cut through. No, sir. She's a projectile at warp nine. And don't ask me what's holding her together. Scott here, sir. There's no use trying to free those men down below. The phaser torches, they won't cut through the bulkheads, nor the doors, nor the decks. There's something happened to the metal. I'm there now, sir, and you never saw such a fine collection of antiques in your life. Aye, sir. A Claymore. You're a beauty. Any signs of those devils, Mister Sulu? They've taken Engineering. I don't know how many more of those Klingons are around, but we'll split up here and try to make it back to the bridge. Sir. Chekov was right, Captain. We should have left those fuzz-faced goons in the transporter. That's right where they belong! Non-existence! Now they can study the Enterprise, add our technology to theirs, change the balance of power. You've jeopardised the Federation! Keep your Vulcan hands off me. Just keep away! Your feelings might be hurt, you green-blooded half-breed! Then transfer out, freak! But this is war. Have we forgotten how to defend ourselves? Without sensors? All our power down? This thing could go anywhere. But, Captain, I didn't do it. Everything just came on by itself. Scotty, sir. The ship's dilithium crystals are deteriorating. We can't stop the process. In twelve minutes, we'll be totally without engine power. There's no change, Captain. The dilithium crystals are discharging. Aye. Now that's something the Klingons would understand. It's the alien that's done this. We're in its power, our people and yours. I wouldn't trust her, Captain. Even if it could work, she may be leading you into a trap. We'll go with you. But she can't guarantee that Kang will stop to listen, right, Mister Spock?"

Deflectors on. Condition Red. Protect yourselves. Total reply if attacked. So that's the answer. Klingons. Maintain Red Alert. We took no action against your ship, Kang. There was a Federation colony on this planet. It was destroyed. Yes, a test of a new Klingon weapon, leaving no traces. Federation ships don't specialise in sneak attacks. You received a distress call? We received a distress call. Go to the devil. Chekov! Stop the torture! Help Chekov. I'll beam you aboard the Enterprise. Once there, no tricks. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Spock. Mister Spock, we have guests. Adjust transporter to wide field. Beam up everyone in the target area. Full security, Johnson, on the double. Good work, Spock. Klingons. Johnson? Bring them in. I said no tricks after we reach the ship. You're a prisoner of the Federation of Planets against which you may or may not have committed an act of war. Prepare to destruct. You wouldn't be standing here if I had. Apparently you have a few things to learn about us. Detain them in the crew lounge. Programme the food synthesiser to accommodate our guests. You'll be well-treated, Kang. Secure from Red Alert. But maintain general quarters. Scan this sector for other ships. Run a full check on the colony. I want this thing nailed down fast. No proof that Klingons committed it. Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that they will be believed. Report. Keep trying. We've got a diplomatic tiger by the tail. Very good, Scotty. Mister Sulu? Fire phasers. Lieutenant Uhura? Mister Sulu, change course to seventeen mark four, warp factor three. Sulu? Override. Scotty, stop all engines. Scotty! New course? That'll take us out of the galaxy. Johnson. Get down to Security. Search every section. Some Klingons may have beamed aboard undetected from the wrecked ship. Then get down to Engineering and help Scotty hammer things back to normal. And free those trapped crewmen. And before I put you in the brig, there's a little something I owe you. Phasers. Out! Sickbay. Bridge. The Klingons are free. They're armed as we are. They'll try to take the ship. Scotty, how many men do we have? Deploy forces to protect your section and the auxiliary control centre. Check the armoury, and try and free those trapped crewmen. Blow out the bulkheads if you have to. We need numbers. What kind of luck have you had controlling the ship's speed? Five-minute report. Kirk out. Full sensor scan of the ship. Report on any movement by the Klingons. The Klingon Empire has maintained a duelling tradition. They think they can beat us with swords. Any other logical candidate? Mister Sulu. Get below. Take command of Engineering and auxiliary control. Mister Chekov. Mister Chekov, as you were. Chekov! This is no time for a vendetta. Maintain your post. Chekov, maintain your post! His only brother, killed in a Klingon raid. Sulu, get down to Engineering. Security, this is the captain. Find Mister Chekov and bring him to the bridge. I don't know, but he does. And now he wants revenge for a non-existent loss. Kirk here. What about the armoury? Get back to Engineering. Try to re-establish engine control, and talk to ordnance about manufacturing phaser replacements. What the blazes is going on? Constant surveillance, Mister Spock. Could more Klingons have beamed aboard? An alien life force. We must make contact, find out what it wants. A brother that never existed, a phantom colony, imaginary distress calls, the creation of these weapons. Do you sense a pattern, Mister Spock? And now it has control of the Enterprise and taking us out of the galaxy. But why? We must talk to Kang, bury the hatchet. McCoy? The alien is the real threat. That's the enemy we have to wipe out. Kirk here. Kang, there's something important I must discuss with you. The Enterprise is heading out of our galaxy, controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship. Engineering has been taken over by Klingons who have cut off life-support systems. Mister Sulu. Get down to emergency manual control. Try to protect our life-support circuits and auxiliary power. Scotty, I'm glad you've come. Scotty? Scotty, take it easy. Gentlemen! Spock! Scotty. Spock. Spock! Stop it! You're half human! What are we saying? What are we doing to each other? We've been under stress before. It's never set us at each other's throats. There isn't any war! Or is there? Scotty. What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in other terms than war. We've been trained to fight its causes, if necessary. Then why are we behaving like a group of savages? Look at me. Look at me. Two forces aboard this ship, each of them equally armed. Has a war been staged for us, complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating? Even, Spock, even race hatred? But what's the game? And whose? And what are the rules? Yes. Mister Sulu, report. We're getting something. Good work. Start scanning. Let's find that alien. Let's go. Chekov! What have I done? There's an alien entity aboard the ship. It's forcing us to fight. We don't want to. We don't know what its motive is. We're trying to find out. You must help us. Take me to Kang. A temporary truce, that's all I ask. Spock, take her. Chekov. Chekov. Is this what's in store for us, from here on in? Violence, hatred. He lost control. So did I. We're becoming animal warriors. Let's go, Spock. Why? So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum? What's next, the roar of crowds? Let's find the alien. You come with us. Maybe we can prove to you that it exists. What is it? What do you want? What are you doing here? Duty? Did McCoy release you from Sickbay? Then get back to Sickbay! I order you Johnson! It subsists on the emotions of others. It exists on the hate of others. And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence. It's got to have a vulnerable area. We've got to get rid of it. Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies, filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare. Kang has got to listen. We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing. Kang. Kang, this is Captain Kirk. Kang, do you read me? Kang. He won't answer. Time factor? Well, do whatever you can. Kirk out. And so we drift in space, with only hatred and bloodshed aboard. Now do you believe? Captain's log, stardate Armageddon. We must find a way to defeat the alien force of hate that has taken over the Enterprise. Stop the war now, or spend eternity in futile bloody violence. If I could talk to Kang, somehow cut through the Klingon lines, make peace before it's too late. Kang! Kang, this is Captain Kirk. I know you can hear me, so don't cut me off. We have Mara, your wife. We talk truce now, or she dies. Reply. She has five seconds to live. Reply. He called my bluff. The Federation doesn't kill or mistreat its prisoners. You've been listening to propaganda, fables. How much time? We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all. There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help. How? We can't get through the Klingon defences in time, unless. Spock. Intra-ship beaming from one section to another. It's possible? We're all in a trap. This is the only way out. No. That'd start the final battle. I believe her. Prepare the transporter. We'll wait for your signal. I hope your computations are correct, Mister Spock. Mara. Before you start killing, give me one minute. Nobody wins. Have any more of your men died? We can't be killed. There's an alien aboard. It wants us alive. Look! Look, Kang. For the rest of our lives. A thousand lifetimes. Senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total control over us. All right. All right. In the heart. In the head. I won't stay dead. Next time I'll do the same to you. I'll kill you. And it goes on, the good old game of war, pawn against pawn! Stopping the bad guys. While somewhere, something sits back and laughs and starts it all over again. Be a pawn, be a toy, be a good soldier that never questions orders. Lieutenant Uhura. Put me on ship-wide intercom. Kang. This is Captain Kirk. A truce is ordered. The fighting is over. Lay down your weapons. Get off my ship. You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We know about you, and we don't want to play. Maybe there are others like you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over. We'll be on guard now, ready for you. So ship out! Come on! Haul it!"

6427,TOS,episode 62,KANG,"You attacked my ship! Four hundred of my crew dead. Kirk, my ship is disabled. I claim yours. You are now prisoners of the Klingon Empire against which you have committed a wanton act of war! For three years, the Federation and the Klingon Empire have been at peace. A treaty we have honoured to the letter. Were the screams of my crew imaginary? What were your orders, Kirk? To start a war? You've succeeded. To test a new weapon? We shall be happy to examine it. By what? No bodies, no ruins. A colony of the invisible? We have wondered when you would begin. You lured my ship into ambush by a false Klingon distress call. You will tell us why with the proper persuasion. I don't propose to spend the rest of my life on this ball of dust arguing your fantasies. The Enterprise is mine! Instruct your transporter room to beam us aboard. We have no devil, Kirk. But we understand the habits of yours. I shall torture you to death one by one until your noble captain cries enough. Who will be first? And you volunteer to join him. That is loyalty. Don't plan any tricks, Kirk. I will kill one hundred hostages at the first sign of treachery. Animals? Your captain crawls like one. A Klingon would never have surrendered. Order everybody in this area to be transported up. All weapons on him. Liar! There are still survivors aboard my ship. Completing the job you started? My wife, Mara, and my science officer. More Federation treachery. We are prisoners. So I have seen. When I take this ship, I'll have Kirk's head stuffed and hung on his cabin wall. No, they wish to question us, learn our strength, our plans. They never will. Patience. Vigilance. They will make a mistake. Capture of the Enterprise will give us knowledge to end this war quickly. Most interesting. The bulk of your crew trapped, your ship racing from this galaxy at wild speeds. Delightful. How did I perform this sabotage, Kirk? All my men are here. Then we take the ship. In time, in time. We must take these sections. First, Engineering. This is Kang. I have captured your engineering section. I now control this ship's power and life-support systems. I have deprived all areas except our own. You will die of suffocation in the icy cold of space. Cause them to be unsteady. One of Kirk's tricks. Could he bypass this circuit? What power is it that supports our battle yet starves our victory? Power. Interrupt it at their main life-support couplings. Where? She is a victim of war, Captain. She understands. Mara, you're alive, and you bring us a prize. Brave captain, what about? What have they done to you, Mara? Are you out of your mind? What have they done to you? I see why the human beast did not kill you. With your death, we win. No doubt you will reassemble after I have hacked you to bits! Klingons kill for their own purposes. This is Kang. Cease hostilities. Disarm. Out! We need no urging to hate humans. But for the present, only a fool fights in a burning house. Out!

The Klingons almost did me in once. I'm out to even the score. I've got my orders. I'm obeying orders! Kill the Klingons! It's them or us, isn't it?"

6430,TOS,episode 62,MARA,"Kang, what has happened? What will they do to us? I've heard of their atrocities, their death camps. They will torture us for our scientific and military information. They will kill us before we can act. We are forty against four hundred. Enemy numbers are the same as ours. We have a fighting balance. Their life-support systems have resumed. Holding steady. They appear to be controlled from another location. Also unable to affect ship's course for return to our empire. Number six deck. Come. Commander, it's a trick! You're not going So this was no trick? We have always fought. We must. We are hunters, Captain, tracking and taking what we need. There are poor planets in the Klingon systems, we must push outward if we are to survive. I will help you now. I will take you to Kang. I will add my voice to yours. Kang, wait. He's come alone, unarmed. He must talk to you. No! Listen to him. We are all in danger. Kang, don't! They didn't harm me. Listen to him. Stop! Stop, please! You fool. Kang, I am your wife. I'm a Klingon. Would I lie for them? Listen to Kirk. He is telling the truth."

6445,TOS,episode 63,SPOCK,"Do we have maximum magnification, Lieutenant? Very archaic type, Captain. Sub light speed. It would appear that the Enterprise is the target, Captain. Yes, Captain? Correct, Captain. We are approaching those co-ordinates. An asteroid, two hundred miles in diameter. Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly. Correct, Captain. Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting. It is pursing an independent course through this solar system. It is under power, Captain. And correcting for all gravitational stresses. Atomic. Very archaic. Leaving a trail of debris and hard radiation. Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow. It surrounds an independent inner core, which has a breathable atmosphere. Sensors read no life forms. Then the passengers, or builders, are dead. Interesting. The course Ensign Chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it on a collision course with Daran Five. Correct. Population approximately three billion and seven hundred twenty four million, if memory serves me correctly. Estimated time of impact three hundred ninety six days. One fails to see the logic in making a ship look like a planet. The asteroid ship is over ten thousand years old, Doctor. Still no sign of life forms, Captain. The doctor must have received an excessively large electrical shock. Nothing else could've caused this, Captain. At least nothing that has happened here. May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor? Yes. I know of it, Captain. Very well, Doctor. The Captain and I seem to have suffered no ill effects. Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command. Logical, Captain. Also logical, Captain. He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains. Indeed, Doctor. The young lady did show a marked preference for your company. We are very interested in your world. Incredible as it may seem, these people have no idea they're living on a spaceship. Captain, the Oracle room. I believe that I can. The writing is definitely Fabrini, Captain. I recognise it. Yes. Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground, as these people do, to protect themselves. Captain. If I remember correctly, the oracle's reprehensible conduct was initiated when Natira knelt on that platform. Nothing here which would indicate this is anything but a planet. There's no question but that the creators would be considered gods. Eight planets, Captain. That is the number in the Fabrina solar system. And no doubt they've been in flight on this asteroid ship for ten thousand years. Your decision is most illogical, Doctor. I believe it's time to move on. She evidently understood something. There are no guards to detain us. Temperature one hundred eleven degrees and rising. Temperature one hundred fifteen degrees. One hundred twenty degrees. Yes, it is. It refers to the altar. Apply pressure to the centre until it opens.   I've neutralised the heating elements. There seems to be a weakness in one of the eight tubes. Yes. Let me check that engine. A very simple problem, easy to correct. I believe we can attempt the course correction, Captain. Guidance control's taking over. I believe we can allow this ship to go back to its automatic control. Captain. Intelligence files. Their banks contain the total knowledge of the Fabrini, ready for the people to consult when they arrive at their destination. And they seem to have amassed a great deal of medical knowledge. Your haemoglobin count is back to normal, Doctor, which indicates that the flow of oxygen to each cell of your body is back up to its abundantly energetic level."

I've just completed the standard physical examinations for the entire crew. The crew is fit. I found nothing unusual, with one exception. Terminal. Xenopolycythemia. It has no cure. He has one year to live. The ship's Chief Medical Officer. I'll be most effective on the job in the time left, if you'll keep this to yourself. Captain's log, stardate 5476.3. I have just had the sad duty of informing Starfleet about Doctor McCoy's condition and have requested an immediate replacement. Without me, Jim? You'd never find your way back. I'd like to go. I'm fine, Captain. You'd swear you were on the surface of a planet. You found no intelligent life forms, Mister Spock, but surely I think so. She called this the world. These people don't know they're on a spaceship. I'm all right. Are you all right, Mister Spock? Oh, that Oracle really got to me. I must be especially susceptible to its magic spells. Well, we'd better get to the control room. Don't worry. I can make it, Jim. Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor. It tastes like an ancient herb derivative. There's something under the skin. He's dead. Oh, no. I'm quite all right, thank you. Well, now. Nobody can blame her for that, can they? Perhaps not. You are very kind. No, thank you. I'm curious. How did the Oracle punish the old man? There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there? It's all right. I suppose we had to learn the power of the Oracle. Honesty is usually wise. No, there isn't. Oh, yes. Yes, I do. We do. But we're strangers to each other. Yes. How long will it take you to reach this new world? If you only knew how I needed some kind of future, Natira. Yes, very lonely. There's something I need to tell you. But there is. I have an illness for which there is no cure. I have one year to live. What are you going to do to my friends? And the punishment is death? They acted out of ignorance, Natira. Please let them return to the ship. For me? I've made my decision. I'm staying here, on Yonada. Natira, what they did, they did because they felt they had to. Please, let them return to the ship. You won't regret it. How do you think I'd feel if I stayed here with the chance to be happy for the first time in my life, but knowing my friends had died? No, I'm not. I'm on a kind of a collision course myself, Jim. And I refuse. I intend to stay on this ship, with these people, whatever happens. Is it, Mister Spock? Is it really? Natira's asked me to stay, and I'm staying. Yes. Is that too much to ask, Jim? I do. Let it be done. We're now of one mind. One life. Do the people know the contents of their book? Has the reason that the people must leave here been revealed to you? Don't you long to know its secrets? Jim. We may be able to get these people back on course. No, but I've seen the book that contains all the knowledge of the creators. And if you If you can get to it, Spock Can dig out the information. The Oracle room. They spoke the truth. She will be. I'll stay here with her. The book is in the monolith. Press the three lower planets on the left-hand side simultaneously. We'll be all right here now, Jim. The oracle can no longer punish us. Yes. Yes. Then come. Don't be afraid. You intend to stay here, on Yonada? Then I won't leave you. Now more than ever, I wish to search through the universe to find a cure for myself and others like me. And I want you to be with me. Thank you, Mister Spock, for bringing back the knowledge of the Fabrini."

Mister Chekov, get a fix on the missile's point of origin. Fire phasers. Mister Chekov, alter course to the missile's point of origin. Warp factor three, Mister Sulu. What's the emergency? That was quite a scene. Excellent. What's the emergency? Serious? What is it? Who? Who is it? You. Mister Spock. Confirm Chekov's co-ordinates for the missile's point of origin. That object on the screen? Could the enemy vessel be hiding behind the asteroid? Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin. Full sensor probe, Mister Spock. How could that be? Unless it's powered. A spaceship? Source of power? Mister Chekov, plot the course of the asteroid vessel. Yes? Daran Five? Inhabited? Mister Sulu, match Enterprise speed with that of the asteroid vessel. Mister Spock and I are transporting aboard. Mister Scott, you have the conn. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and I will handle this. Well, I think it would be wiser if All right, Doctor. If that's what you want. Wouldn't know this was a spaceship. Kirk to Enterprise. Transported without incident. Kirk out. No apparent opening. Of a sort. Weapons, communication devices. Let me go to my friend. You all right? I can't say I think much of your welcome. They've been in flight ten thousand years. Maybe they don't realise it. I am Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my medical officer, Doctor McCoy. My first officer, Mister Spock. We've come in friendship. Spock. Doctor McCoy. Bones. Bones? No, that's not it. You're right, Spock. The shock was serious because of McCoy's weakened condition. I don't think he would've told you himself, but I think you should know now. It's xenopolycythemia. Then you know that nothing can be done. Bones, how is it? Spock knows. Are you in any condition to get up? No. The people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge, but it's better than exterminating them. And the three billion on Daran Five. No, we're from outside your world. Up there. Outside, up there, everywhere. Why is it forbidden? What is it, Bones? For the world is hollow, and I have touched the sky. Yes, of course it is, because if you did you'd touch the sky and find out that you were living on a big ball. Not a planet, but a spaceship. And that knowledge seems to be forbidden. We don't know. He just suddenly screamed in pain and died. You seem to be the special favourite. Personally, I find the lady's taste questionable, but she obviously prefers you, and you obviously don't seem to mind. If you could arrange to be alone with the young lady, Spock and I would be left alone to find the power controls of this world. Thank you, Mister Spock. To our good friends of Yonada. Good. Then you wouldn't mind if we looked around? Thank you. And thank you for taking care of Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock. I wonder how many generations have lived out their lives and been buried here without ever knowing that their world is hollow. The problem, to get in. Fabrini? Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets? Some of them must have been put aboard this ship and sent to another planet. And these are their descendants. Now. The Oracle doesn't seem to know we're here. I wonder what alerted it the first time. I think you're right. Continue investigating. The clue to the location of the control room must be around here somewhere. This plaque is a representation of a star and its solar system. Then there's no doubt these people are the descendants of the Fabrini. You're returning with us? Bones, this isn't a planet. It's a space ship on a collision course with Daran Five. Doctor McCoy, I order you to return with us. Bones, if we can't correct the course of this ship, we'll have to blast it out of space. As her husband? Kirk to Enterprise. We're beaming over. Lock in on our signal. And transport Mister Spock and myself immediately. He's staying, Scotty. Kirk out. That is the problem, sir. Yes. Those are the orders. Kirk here. Put him on. Yes, Bones. You've located the controls? Where is it? Bones, are you all right? Bones, answer me! Bones, what is it? Bones, what is it? McCoy, what's happening? What's happening, McCoy? Help him. Spock, take care of McCoy. We have freed him from the cruelty of your Oracle. Bones. Bones. You said something about a book. Where is it? Now listen to me. You must listen to what I have to say. Give me one moment to speak to you. One moment. Natira, if you don't believe what I'm about to tell you, you can call the guards. We'll accept any punishment you decree. You must believe that what I'm about to tell you is the truth. Yes, my world and your world of Yonada. I understand. I understand, Natira. Ten thousand years ago, a sun was dying and with it, its world. It's the world you see on the plaque in the room of the Oracle. No. It is the world of your ancestors, your creators. It no longer exists. No, I'm not. Now listen to me! Hear me out. When your ancestors discovered that their world was dying they built a great ship and chose their best people. They wished for their race to survive. They sent the ship out into space. Yes. No. You are living inside a hollow ball. Your ancestors created it to take you on a journey to a promised new planet. Because a flaw developed in the controls. And unless we correct it, Yonada will kill millions of people and destroy a world it doesn't even know. Let us remove the instrument of obedience, the way we did for McCoy. Natira. Do you think she understood me? Is she all right? We do this for the survival of the people of Yonada. We mean no desecration to the faith of Yonada. We must consult the book to help you. McCoy, how do you open this thing? Here. The plan must be in there. Is it indexed? Hurry, Spock. Let's get her out of the heat. Active and functional. Not too different from the Enterprise. Enough to turn it off course? Good. Going back to marked headings. Steadying on course marked in red. Doctor McCoy, the Fabrini descendants are scheduled to debark on their promised planet in approximately three hundred and ninety days. I think that we could manage to be in that vicinity at that time, if you wanted to thank the Fabrini personally. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Oh, Oracle of the people, most perfect and wise. Strangers have come to our world. They bear instruments we do not understand. Who are you? For what reason do you visit this world? What happened? Fetch the guard. Forgive him for he was an old man, and old men are sometimes foolish. But it is written that those of the people who sin or speak evil shall be punished. He served well for many years. Take him away, gently. You do not seem well. It is distressing to me. It is the will of the Oracle that you now be treated as honoured guests. It is time to refresh yourselves. That pleases us. Not at all. The people know of you now. Are you well enough to go about? Then why not remain here? Rest. We will talk. You are free to go about and meet our people. Not at all. We shall make him well. Leave us. I cannot tell you now. What we say, what we think. The Oracle knows the minds and the hearts of all the people. I did not know you would be hurt so badly. McCoy, there is something I must say. Since the moment I. It is not in the manner of the people to hide their feelings. Is there a woman for you? Does McCoy find me attractive? I hope you men of space, of other worlds, hold truth as dear as we do. I wish you to stay here on Yonada as my mate. But is not that the nature of men and women? That the pleasure is in the learning of each other? Let the thought rest in your heart, McCoy. The people, in the fullness of time, will reach a new world. Rich, green, lovely to the eyes, and of a goodness that will fill the hearts of the people with tears of joy. You can share that world with me, rule it by my side. Soon. The Oracle will only say soon. You have lived a lonely life? No more, McCoy. There will be no more loneliness for you. There is nothing you need to say. Then tell me, if the telling is such a need. Until I saw you, there was nothing in my heart. It sustained my life, but nothing more. Now it sings. I could be happy to have that feeling for a day, a week, a month, a year. Whatever the creators hold in store for us. It is I, Natira. It is written only the high priestess of the people may select her mate. The strangers among us, the three visitors. There is one called McCoy. I wish him to remain here as my mate. I have asked him. He has not yet given me his answer. He will be told what must be done. It will be done, o most wise. Two of the strangers, Kirk and Spock. No. I know. When the oracle releases them, take them. Fools. You think we are children? You think you can do as you please, commit whatever offence amuses you? They entered the Oracle room. Yes. I can make no other decision. We gave them our trust, they betrayed us. They said they came in friendship. I cannot. Yes. So be it. This I will do for McCoy. For our happiness and future. Say now, because once done, it is done. You are now one with my people. May I give you the love you want, and make the time you have beautiful. One heart. It is done, O most wise. Our living link with the creators. This is the Book of the People, to be opened and read when we reach the new world of the promise. It was given by the creators. Only that it tells of our world here and why soon, one day, we must leave it for the new world. No, it has not. No. It is enough for me to know that we shall understand all when we reach our home. Captain's Log, stardate 5476.4. We are on a parallel course with Yonada. It is still on a collision course with Daran Five. Our failure to correct its course and the critical nature of Doctor McCoy's illness made the extraordinary event of contact with Starfleet Command imperative. You are killers of your friend. I will have you put to death. Until you are dead, he will think of you and disobey! I will see you die! He is not part of our people. You've released him from his vow of obedience. McCoy. They must not know. You will never see the book. It is sacrilege! Guards! Guards! Guards! What do you wish to say? Your truth, of your world. You don't obey the law of the creators. How can you understand my world? That is a world of which Yonada is a part. You are mad. You wish me to believe that Yonada is a ship? But we have a sun. It did not die. At night I see the stars. Why should the Why should the truth wait for you to come to Yonada? Why should the truth be kept from us? Why should the creators keep us in darkness? No. No, you do not speak the truth. I believe only the Oracle. I believe! Yes. I have listened. Yes, I did. They said they spoke the truth. Is truth not truth for all? I must know the truth of the world! Your friends have told me of your world. I believe you. I believe. The creators kept us in darkness. There's nothing I can do. I believe with you, husband. Your friends have prevented it? And will they send this this ship again to the land the creators intended? That is good. No. I do not fear the punishment of disobedience. Well, then, come. We must hurry to join No, I cannot go with you. It is not fear. I understand the great purpose of the creators. I shall honour it. I shall stay willingly, and because that is what I must do. Will McCoy stay here to die? No. McCoy will not let go of life and the fullness of years. This is my universe. You came here with a great mission to save my people. Shall I abandon them? Perhaps one day, if it is permitted, you will find Yonada again."
6831,TOS,episode 63,ORACLE,"Then learn what it means to be our enemy before you learn what it means to be our friend. Speak. Yes, Natira. It is so written. Does he agree to this? He must become one of the people, worship the creators, and agree to the insertion of the Instrument of Obedience. If he agrees to all things, it is permitted. Teach him our laws carefully so he commits no sacrilege, no offence against the people or the creators. Who are the intruders? McCoy is not with them? Kirk and Spock have committed sacrilege. You know what must be done. To become one of the people of Yonada, the Instrument of Obedience must be made part of your flesh. Do you now give your consent? Proceed. Teach him, then, what he must know as one of the people. You have listened to the words of the non-believers. That was the first transgression. You felt the pain of warning? Why did you listen further? Their truth. The truth of Yonada is your truth. There can be no other for you. Repent your disobedience. It is sacrilege to the temple. You are not believers. You are forbidden to gaze at the book. It is blasphemy. You are forbidden. The punishment is death."

6846,TOS,episode 64,SPOCK,"Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all sensors. I cannot. According to our instruments, space itself is literally breaking up. There is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings. Negative. I have run a complete check on all systems. Fascinating. There is virtually no sensor contact. No mass analysis. No trace of radiation. We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there. Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign. The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard. Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel. Captain, the Defiant's sensors correspond with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the Enterprise. Affirmative. Request permission to remain, Captain. I could be completing the data. Captain, there is a chance Energise. Negative. Compute the next period of spatial interphase. We must try, Mister Scott. The fabric of space is very weak here. If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the Captain alive. Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov. We exist in a universe which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space. At certain brief periods of time, an area of their space overlaps an area of ours. That is a time of interphase, during which we can connect with the Defiant's universe. Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it. If we are not extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped ourselves. Chekov! Chekov! Security guards to the Bridge. I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked. Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov. The same fury which was evident in the Defiant. Is there anything you need to isolate the cause? If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move. Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made. The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant phased out. It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived. However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die. And there can be no margin for error. His environmental unit can provide breathable air for no more than three point six two hours. Status, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, signal Red Alert. Transfer to main viewer. Spock, in command of the Federation star ship Enterprise. Commander, according to the Federation, this area is free space. We are not interested in your display of force. The Enterprise is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is currently engaged in rescue operations. Do you wish to assist us? The other ship is interspatially trapped. It should reappear in one hour and fifty three minutes. We request you stand by until then. Bridge to transporter room. Ready for interphase in twenty seconds. Lock on to Captain Kirk's co-ordinates And prepare to bring him aboard, Mister Scott. Bring him aboard, Mister Scott. Well, keep trying, Mister Scott. Lieutenant Sulu, evaluation. It's possible the Tholian entry into the area has disturbed the space, and if that has occurred Spock here. Negative, Doctor. Theoretically it already has happened, Doctor. However, the ship's sensors are not responding as predicted. I did, Doctor. The space was disturbed by the Tholians. Not at this interphase. I shall have to recalculate to determine when the next interphase will occur. They do not take place at regular intervals. I have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause, Doctor, and prevent further spread of the affliction. The renowned Tholian punctuality. Engineering, hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary expenditures. Mister Sulu, divert all but emergency maintenance power to the shields. Spock here. Understood. Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to the Tholian ship. Mister Sulu, lock in phaser tracking controls. Ready, Mister Sulu? Fire. Engineering, status report. Mister Scott? Can you estimate minimum time required for repair? The decision to fight was logical. Lack of time prevented any other course of action. The Tholian ship had to be disabled. Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons. Please go to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects of this space. That is your primary task, since we must remain here. Fascinating. Negative. Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the approaching vessel? Distance, Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments. Tie in all sensors to the ship's library computer console. Switch scanners. There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology. It is, however, an energy field, and if the Tholians are successful in completing this structure before we have completed our repairs, we shall not see home again. Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this space was negative. The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory. A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the Enterprise. His concern was not only for them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship. You all know the sequence of events. We were fired upon by the Tholian ship. At that time, Captain Kirk may have been alive. I deemed it necessary to return the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise. The Tholian ship has been disabled. But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact that Captain Kirk is no longer alive. I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which Captain Kirk commanded. Each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts. It can wait, Doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on the bridge. It will wait for a more suitable moment, Doctor. The mental and physical state of this crew are your responsibility, Doctor. At the moment, they are your top priority. We came here for a specific purpose, Doctor. The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the risk of his own life or even his own ship. I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of this crew. There is a margin of variation in any experiment. While there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the Captain's status. That is enough, Doctor. We both have other things to do. You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our responsibilities here. Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise. If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of duty. That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship. What would you have me say, Doctor? Spock here. I shall be there shortly. Doctor, I believe we each have our respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs. Spock here. Proceed, Mister Scott. Report to Doctor McCoy all symptoms noted prior to the attack. Spock out. Bridge. Spock here. Negative. We are relatively stable at the moment. Why do you ask? What is it, Mister Scott? Mister Scott? Report to the bridge immediately. In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see. I was merely stating a fact, Doctor. Please leave that to me, Doctor McCoy. I realise that the crew are your prime concern. You can best serve them in your laboratory. I urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found. I understand, Doctor. I'm sure the Captain would simply have said forget it, Bones. Captain? Captain? Captain. Exactly. But the Captain remained. Only the overlap time changed. The next interphase will occur here. Can you be ready? It will have to do, Mister Scott. Come. You've found the antidote, Doctor. Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he responded to it? Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons. If I remember correctly, it caused fatality only when used in pure form. Welcome back, Lieutenant. Your absence was keenly felt, Mister Chekov. Estimated time for completion of the Tholian web. Are the ships computers programmed for entry into interspace? Spock to engineering. Prepare for interphase in Fifteen seconds. Stand by with full power. It will have to do. Ready to transport on my order. Try to maintain position Mister Sulu. Engineering, bring ship's power up to full capability. Negative, Ensign. Utilising ship's power has thrown us clear of it. Compute the distance from the original location. We shall soon see, Lieutenant. Good. Since the Captain was locked into our transporter beam when we were thrown clear of the interphase area, he should've been drawn here with us. Spock to transporter room. The Captain's oxygen supply is running out now. Are you standing by with a hypo of tri-ox compound for him? Prepare to transport on the Captain's co-ordinates on my order. I see him, Ensign. I see him. Now, Doctor. None worth reporting, Captain. Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable when humans are involved. Orders, Captain? No. You see, the crisis was upon us, and then passed so quickly, Captain, that we"

Mister Spock didn't believe me either, did he, Doctor? Then I didn't really see him, did I? Will I become like Chekov, Doctor? Am I all right, Doctor? Then what I saw Captain Kirk's alive?

6854,TOS,episode 64,MCCOY,"Jim. The Captain's neck is broken. McCoy here. I'd say these people killed each other. You heard correctly, Jim. These people killed each other. According to the ship's log, the medical surgeon down here didn't even know what was going on. The best I can do is get all the readings I can get and analyse them later. What the devil? Jim, this ship is dissolving. My hand just passed through a man And a table. What happened, Mister Spock? Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before this? Did he seem to be getting hysterical? Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint. That's what I was afraid of. Whatever it was that drove the crew of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable. Time. By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant. How long will that take? Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive? If we could only find the proper filtering agent, we might be able to solve this problem. Negative. It's the third failure. Nurse, take this sample and run an analysis on it. Thank you, nurse. Call security. I want to have some checks run on this man. McCoy to Bridge. Has the Captain been beamed aboard yet? When is that interphase going to happen? I thought you had the thing timed out. You mean you don't know whether you're going to be able to recover the Captain or not? You can't wait for the next one. We've had another case like Chekov. I had to confine my orderly to sickbay. The disease is not transmitted by the men, Mister Spock. The cause is the area of space we're in. It's affecting the whole crew. The molecular structure of the brain tissues in the central nervous system are distorting. And the madness that affected the Defiant's crew will soon happen to the Enterprise. Now you've got to get this ship out of here. What's the use of this battle, Spock? You've lost Jim. Take this ship out of here. Are you satisfied? Spock, why did you do it? You should've known what could've happened and done everything in your power to safeguard your crew. That is the mark of a starship Captain, like Jim. It's still negative, Mister Spock. Theragen is the most promising substance tested so far. We're progressing. My staff is working around the clock. My being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests. This service requires my personal attention, Mister Spock. Take him to Sickbay. Put him in restraint. There is a duty to be performed in the Captain's quarters, which requires our presence. The Captain left a message tape. It was his order that it be reviewed by both of us, should he ever be declared dead. You have just declared Jim dead. Why? Are you afraid it'll change your present status? The Captain's last order is top priority, and you will honour that order before you take over. He was a hero in every sense of the word, yet his life was sacrificed for nothing. The one thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the Enterprise. Now you've made that impossible, Mister Spock. Maybe not the same one. I really came here to find out why you stayed and fought. Yes, he would, Mister Spock, but you didn't have that decision to make. What would you gain by fighting the Tholians? You could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area. But you chose to stay. Why? You mean to be sure if he was dead. Well, you made certain of that. Yes, I have something to do. If this crew is to survive, I have to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into. There's no hurry, Mister Spock. The antidote probably doesn't concern you. Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time. I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't believe that you would want Jim's command. You must know that if you get us out of this situation, they'll pin a medal on your chest and give you command of the Enterprise. I would like to remedy that situation. Spock, I, er, I'm sorry. It does hurt, doesn't it? Of course you have, Uhura. We would all like to Of course. We're going to Sickbay. Yes, Nurse. Yes, it's beginning to spread generally throughout the ship. No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's the answer. And it better be the next one. Well, nobody saw him but you, Uhura. I don't think so. No, no. We're working hard. We'll find an antidote. Sounds like a horror story. Suppose there's any truth in it? Do you suppose they're seeing Jim because they've lost confidence in you? It's getting critical. There have been a number of assaults down on the lower decks. Even Scotty's being affected. If Scotty goes under, that's the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the Enterprise out of here. Spock! It must be this space. It's getting to me too. I know it's nothing you've done, Spock. I, I'm sorry. Yes, Uhura, you're fine. It was real. We all saw him. The Captain's still alive. McCoy here. I'll be right there. Compliments of the house. To your good health and the health of the crew. Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone aboard the ship. I would like for you gentlemen to drink it down. He's his smiling self again. I've discharged him from Sickbay. It's a diluted theragen derivative. That's right, and in this derivative, mixed with alcohol, it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain. One good slug of this, and you can hit a man with phaser stun, and he'd never feel it or even know it. It should. Well, drink it down, Spock. It's the human thing to do. That's a medical order, Captain. McCoy here. I'm ready, Mister Spock. Welcome home, Jim. Oh, we managed. Mister Spock gave the orders, and I found the answers. He means when humans become involved with Vulcans, Jim. What orders are you referring to, Jim? Oh, those orders. Well, there wasn't time. We never had a chance to listen to them."

Aye, aye, Captain. Aye, aye, Captain. Standing by. Aye, I think you're right. Keep us within beaming range, but not too close. Bridge to transporter room. You got that transporter working yet, Mister? Take over, Mister Sulu. I'll be in the transporter room. Scott here. I can't, sir. At least, not all at once. Everything. That ship you're in is fading out, and it's ripping the innards out of this one. It's jamming our transporter frequencies. I've only got three of them working, and I'm not sure of those. One of you has got to wait. Aye. Anything? That's it. I've done all I can. There's nothing out there to grab a hold of and bring in. When that ship went, it must have taken the Captain with it. Two hours and twelve minutes? That power leak has unbalanced the ship and she's starting to drift. I can't hold her in place that long. He had no cause to be angry. Transporter room here. I'm trying. Captain Kirk is not on his designated co-ordinates, Mister Spock. Scott to Bridge! I know you don't like to use the phasers, but you've got to do something about that ship out there. Spock, that hit from the Tholians has fused our power supply converters. I can't do a thing with the Enterprise now. She's bound to drift, maybe right through that doorway out there. I don't even know if she can be repaired. Attention. Dismissed. Mister Spock, we have a readout on the Tholian tractor field. I think we can estimate its approximate completion time. Scott to Captain. Scott to Captain. One of our crewmen just went berserk, but we have him under control for the moment. We're beginning to interphase. Scott to Bridge. Are we slipping into interspace? I don't believe it. Mister Spock. I've just seen Captain Kirk. He was standing there as plain as we are. And then he just disappeared. Mister Spock, look! Then your fears about that phaser were correct. It blasted a hole right through that crazy space fabric, and only heaven knows where it sent the Defiant. That'll be about twenty minutes. Aye, she'll be back together. But we'll only have about eighty percent power built up. What have you got there? What is it? Aye. And deadly, too. What are you thinking of, Doc? Are you trying to kill us all? Oh, well, any decent brand of Scotch will do that. Does it make a good mix with Scotch? I'll let you know. Scott here. Aye, sir. Standing by. She's only up to seventy six percent."
6860,TOS,episode 64,KIRK,"Specify. What about sensor failure? How bad is it? How about it, Spock? Explain. The Defiant! Mister Sulu, impulse engines only. Close to transporter range. Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency. Good. Maintain position. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, come with me. Doctor McCoy, report to the transporter room immediately. Scotty, you have the conn. Energise. Use the ship's sensors to locate them. Kirk to Enterprise. Prepare to beam over a full security squad on my orders. Odd, Mister Spock. Very odd. Spock, you stay here with me. Chekov, get down to Engineering and life support systems. Doctor McCoy, check out the Sickbay. Kirk to Enterprise. Cancel the security squad and stand by for further instructions. Report, Mister Chekov. Get back up here. Kirk to McCoy. Bones, can you tell me what they all died of? They what? Could mental disease have infected all of the crew? Bones, what is it? Bones, what is it? Answer me! Answer me! Get up here on the double. You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the Enterprise? Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott. Mister Scott, stand by to beam us back. Why not? What's happened? Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation. You, too, Spock. Request denied. I know what the chances are. Mister Spock, don't argue. Get back with the information. I'll be right there. Scotty, energise transporter. Bones, Spock. since you are playing this tape, we will assume that I am dead, that the tactical situation is critical, and both of you are locked in mortal combat. It means, Spock, that you have control of the ship and are probably making the most difficult decisions of your career. I can offer only one small piece of advice, for whatever it's worth. Use every scrap of knowledge and logic you have to save the ship. But temper your judgment with intuitive insight. I believe you have those qualities, but if you can't find them in yourself, seek out McCoy. Ask his advice. And if you find it sound, take it. Bones, you've heard what I've just told Spock. Help him if you can. But remember he is the Captain. His decisions must be followed without question. You might find that he is capable of human insight and human error. They are most difficult to defend, but you will find that he is deserving of the same loyalty and confidence each of you have given me. Take care. Bones. I had a whole universe to myself after the Defiant was thrown out. There was absolutely no one else in it. I must say I prefer a crowded universe much better. How did you two get along without me? Good. No problems between you? Try me. Which humans, Mister Spock? Ah, yes. I understand. Well, I hope my last orders were helpful in solving any problems that you don't feel worth reporting. My last orders. The last orders that I left for both of you. The last taped orders. Good. Good. Well, I hope we won't have similar opportunities to test those orders which you never heard.

I believe we're experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of Parmen's delirium. How does one obtain the power? Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here. Even if he shouldn't. Doctor McCoy, you may yet cure the common cold. Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the Enterprise. To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain. Agreed, Captain. And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise. Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above all, justice. Two spacemen marching to a drum. + We slith among the mimsey toves, and gyre among the borogoves. I trust they did not injure you too much, Captain. The humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear. I can understand. That may be, Doctor. However, I have noted that the healthy release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you. So it would seem. Captain. Do you still feel anger toward Parmen? And you, Doctor? Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine. I might have seriously injured you, Captain, even killed you. They have evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further. I must master it. I must control. Alexander, it is possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that that power began to develop? And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you? That's close enough, Alexander. Fascinating. Their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods. Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods. Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element. The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius. The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also regulate body growth. Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia secret. Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power. The point is well taken. However, the psychokinetic power is not additive. If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities, two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed Parmen. The time factor concerns me. It may take days or even weeks before there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us. I have experienced a slight flush, Captain. Take care, young ladies, and value your wine. Be watchful of young men in their velvet prime. Deeply they'll swallow from your finest kegs. Then swiftly be gone leaving bitter dregs. Ah, bitter dregs. With smiling words and tender touch. Man offers little and asks for so much"" He loves in the breathless excitement of night, then leaves with your treasure in cold morning light. Ah, in cold morning light"" We have tried. I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you. Quite possible and logical. That would be highly uncharacteristic. We must expect, Parmen, that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you."

I know it, but I wish I could stop trembling. I'm thinking. I'm thinking of all the times on the Enterprise when I was scared to death and I would see you so busy at your commands. And I would hear your voice from all the parts of the ship and my fears would fade. And now they are making me tremble. But I'm not afraid. I am not afraid."

7256,TOS,episode 65,MCCOY,"I am. What's the problem? Well, what happened to that leg? I don't understand. This should have been attended to immediately. Well, we're certainly going to try. The infection is massive. Let me give you a hypo to ease the pain. In the arm. I'll let you know when I have the results. And from now on, it would be better if I handled the instruments without your help. Neither do I, but it has. How do I knock out an infection when the tricorder doesn't show any information on Platonius bacteria? All I can do, and this is going to take time, is to try to match his bugs with a known strain and hope. What about medicine? Why no doctors? I think I'd better wait until the fever breaks. Jim, my concoction actually worked. The fever's broken. And what recuperative powers. The infection's begun to drain already. He may still need the ship's medical stores. Why prevent contact? I don't know. I don't want to go, but I can't help myself. I'm very sorry, but that's impossible. The answer is no. I can't move, Jim. They're going to keep me here no matter what. Leave, please. You won't persuade me. Stop it! Don't do this to him, Parmen! No, Parmen! Stop it! I have my orders. And we've had too much of yours. I'll never get me to stay here. He's a Vulcan. You can't force emotion out of him. You'll destroy him. I beg you. There is no medicine that can help him. He'll have to come through this himself. The release of emotions, Mister Spock, is what keeps us healthy. Emotionally healthy, that is. Yes, Spock. And hatred. Jim. This is senseless. I've thought it over. I'm staying. Parmen has promised me you'll be safe. Why? Why trick me? Then why wouldn't Alexander have the same power as the others? You won't even know it happened. Of course. Parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability, and Alexander the lowest, in the same environmental conditions. I'll run both their blood samples through for a full comparative test on the tricorder. The one significant difference between Parmen's blood and Alexander's is a concentration of kironide, broken down by pituitary hormone. It'll take some doing, but it is possible. Even if the kironide reaches the desired effect, it still may not help us get out of here. I'm ready. Since the kironide's broken down and injected directly into his bloodstream, it should work on him as well as us. Better in fact, because he's acclimated. They'll never do it, Jim. Stop it, Parmen! Stop it! I'll do whatever you want me to do. I'll stay and serve you, but stop it!"

7261,TOS,episode 65,SCOTT,"Scott to Captain Kirk. Captain, we're in the midst of a storm. No discernible cause, and I've never seen anything like it. There's Ten scale turbulence right now. Emergency gyros and stabilisers at maximum. If this keeps up, Captain, we can't last! I've tried that, sir. She's locked tight. Right, Captain. Scott on the Enterprise. It's all right, Captain. The turbulence has abated. Aye, Captain. Scott here, sir. I'm afraid I can't do that, sir. Everything's frozen. It's not the turbulence, sir. Damage to the ship is minimal. I don't know, sir, and those are the facts. No, sir. The orbit's locked tighter than ever. And subspace communication with Starfleet, it's completely severed."
7262,TOS,episode 65,KIRK,"That's right. Who are the inhabitants of this planet? Bones, I can't understand why a simple cut like that could become so serious. This psychokinetic power of yours, how long have you had it? That's why you have no resistance? Kirk to Enterprise. Engines at full speed. Get her out of orbit and into space. Then there's nothing you can do but batten down and weather. Parmen's mind is not Watch it! He's not only throwing around furniture, he's tearing up the Enterprise as well. Bones, knock him out fast. Alexander. Stand behind me. Hurry up with that shot! Bones! Shake him. Break his concentration. Kirk to Enterprise. Good. I think you'll find the orbit lock is broken as well. Assess damage and repair whatever is necessary. No thanks is necessary. Oh, thank you, we must return to the ship. Well, in that case, we'll stay. Thank you, Alexander. Tell me what? Where is everyone? Alexander, are there other Platonians like you? Who don't have the psychokinetic ability. Don't worry about it. We're happy without it. Alexander, where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference, and nobody has the power. That might not be easy should Parmen die. Yes. This utopia of theirs is one of the best-kept secret in the galaxy. Screening themselves from our sensors, locking us into orbit. All this adds up to a pattern. If ever there was a time to get out of here, it is now. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, come in. Prepare to beam us up. The turbulence hit you that hard? What caused it? Did you get up into space? All right, Scotty. I'll handle it down here. Stand by. Your Excellency. I would like to know why the ship's instrumentation and weaponry is frozen, and why the Enterprise is locked in orbit. Parmen, I've talked to the engineer aboard the ship. We've showed our good faith. Now you show yours. I want this ship released immediately. Guests? You don't know the meaning of the word. Guests aren't treated like common prisoners. Kirk to Enterprise. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Enterprise, come in. Enterprise. I can't raise them. No, Mister Spock. One thing for certain. Parmen is not concerned with my dignity or safety. Where are you going? Has the Enterprise been released yet? Certainly. Has the Enterprise been released yet? Then good day, and thank you for the presents. Doctor McCoy saved your life. And you consider yourself a disciple of Plato? And if his mind isn't strong enough, he gets torn apart like Alexander. We don't use our weapons for the kind of brutality you practice. Come on, Doctor. McCoy. No. You're the doctor. They don't want to force you. They need your goodwill. They're trying We're not leaving until McCoy is released. I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum. We slith among the mimsey toves, and gyre among the borogoves. You're not staying, McCoy. No matter what he tries to Being your slave, what should I do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend, nor services to do, till you McCoy. No matter what he makes me say or do, the answer's no. Is this your utopia, your grand vision of the future? You don't even Spock. Spock. Don't let them break you. Hold on. Don't Can you do anything for him? My muscles are sore, that's all. Which just goes to prove that there's no such thing as a perfect solution. Yes, Spock. Great anger. You can't. Promised? Parmen? He'd let us beam up to the Enterprise, and plunge the ship back into the atmosphere. Because, if he killed us outright in front of you, you'd retaliate. You're a doctor. You have the means. Bones, I know you're trying to do the right thing, but if any one of us escaped, Parmen knows Starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished. Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay, and you sign our death warrant. Put it down. Put it down. Do what I say. Give it to me! In that case, what's the point in you dying too, Alexander? Give it to me. That's all right. It's all right, Alexander. Listen, we haven't given up, and there may be something you can do to help. All right. Did the Platonians always have this power? Bones, I think it'd be a good idea if you took a reading of Alexander's blood. You still have a tricorder reading of Parmen's blood, don't you? And if our theory works out, we've got a weapon. Kironide. It's a high-energy source. That could be it. Exactly. McCoy, there must be a quick way of building up a concentration of kironide in our blood. What are we waiting for? What is it, Bones? Yes. There are thirty eight of them. Let's not any waste time. Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream. Yes. What about Alexander? Why not? You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet. Alexander. Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura. I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining. Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot? So did l. Let's try a simple test. Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit. Nothing. Not yet, Parmen. You have to convince the doctor first. That's the way they want you to feel. It makes them think that they're alive. Try not to think of them. Try. You're half dead, all of you! You've been dead for centuries. We may disappear tomorrow, but at least we're living now, and you can't stand that, can you? You're half crazy because there's nothing inside. Nothing. And you have to torture us to convince yourselves you're superior.   I did. Platonians, listen to me. The next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt. Not only do we have your psychokinetic abilities, but at twice your power level. Do you want to be like him? To us, killing is murder, even for revenge. But there will be other starships. I don't believe you. Just remember, we can recreate that power in a matter of hours, so don't try anything. You're very good at making speeches, Parmen. Just make sure that this one sinks in. Now move aside. Alexander. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, prepare to beam us up. I have a little surprise for you. I'm bringing a visitor aboard. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

7636,TOS,episode 65,PARMEN,"I suppose I scratched it. Sheer ignorance. Is there anything you can do? Where? What is it? What is your prognosis, Doctor? Parmen will do. Philosopher kings have no need of titles. Captain, please. You are mistaken, I assure you. The amenities, Captain. Allow me to remind you that I am the head of this principality. Guests do not come barging in here, making demands and issuing orders. Do not take that tone with me. Captain, wait. I know what you're thinking. My humble apologies. You were badly used. In my own defence, allow me to say that my illness was more profoundly disturbing that I myself realised. I am sure that you, too, have been out of sorts and have been driven to fits of temper and rage. Unlike you, however, what I think and feel, whether for good or ill, is instantly translated into reality. So please, find it in your heart to forgive me. It will be shortly. Not at all. But there is one final request. After my nearly fatal infection, it has become obvious to us all that we cannot afford to be without a skilled physician. Therefore we should like you, Doctor McCoy, to remain. Your duties will be extraordinarily light. You'll be free to read, meditate, conduct research, whatever you like. You'll want for nothing. We should like to keep it cordial, but we are determined to have you stay, Doctor. I am losing patience, Captain. We manage to live in peace and harmony. My dear Mister Spock, I admit that circumstances have forced us to make a few adaptations of Plato, but ours is the most democratic society conceivable. Anyone can, at any moment, be or do anything he wishes, even to becoming ruler of Platonius if his mind is strong enough. Oh, come now. We are not children. In your culture, justice is the will of the stronger. It is forced upon people by means of weapons and fleets of spaceships. Our justice is the will of the stronger mind, and I for one, consider it a vast improvement. Farewell, Captain. Captain, go while you still can. This is not the Enterprise. You are not in command, captain. No, my dear. That might offend the good doctor. You wish to stay? By all means. You can help us celebrate our anniversary. In the process, I hope we can persuade you to join our tiny republic. I think we will. Well, Doctor? As you wish, Doctor. We've had enough or your moralising. You will be happy to stay. It takes a little time, Doctor, but you will be happy to stay. We can't let him die laughing, can we? How can you let this go on? Fellow academicians. Twenty five hundred years ago, a band of hearty vagabonds arrived on this barren, rough-hewn planet. There was a desperate hardship of backbreaking toil. And then a divine providence graced our genius and our dedication with the power of powers. And through it, our every need instantly materialised. We thereupon determined to form a utopian brotherhood. This night is indeed a festive occasion, for tonight, we welcome into that brotherhood its first new member. Doctor, please. You have destroyed the festive mood of the ladies. We must recapture it at once. I know. What would be better than a serenade from the laughing spaceman? And now let the revels begin. You are so impatient, my wife. Observe the doctor and learn. He's quite content to wait for the piece de resistance. Alexander again. He likes to play with knives. Very well, we shall indulge him. Who did that? Not twice mine! Captain, no! Captain! I beg of you, I'll do anything you say. I do not wish to die. Captain, do you hear me? Captain, you knew that I intended to destroy both you and the Enterprise, yet you spared me. There's no need for concern. They'll be safe. Of late, I have begun to think that we've become bizarre and unproductive. We are existing merely to nourish our own power. It's time for some fresh air. We shall welcome your interstellar visits. Understood, Captain. And you're right, none of us can be trusted. Uncontrolled, power will turn even saints into savages, and we can all be counted upon to live down to our lowest impulses."
7637,TOS,episode 65,DIONIYDE,"Well played, Eraclitus. Oh, how faithless and fickle. Careful, Mister Spock. Too much love is dangerous. What is this?"
7638,TOS,episode 65,PHILANA,"Welcome to our republic. Whom among you is the physician? My spouse. His leg. Come this way. Alexander, you talk too much. Captain's log, stardate 5784.3. Doctor McCoy is endeavouring to treat the leader of a strange group of people. When their planet novaed, millennia ago, they transported themselves to Earth in the time of Socrates and Plato. After the death of the Greek civilisation they idolised, they came to this planet and created for themselves a utopia patterned after it. Two and a half. Ever since our arrival here on Platonius. Brain waves. No, not if they're embedded in the unconscious. We haven't had any pressing need for the medical arts. You see, while still on Sahndara, we instituted a mass eugenics programme. We're the result. Pared down to a population of thirty eight, we're perfect for our utopia. We're bred for contemplation and self-reliance. And longevity. How old would you say I am? Don't be afraid. I'm not vain. That old? I stopped aging at thirty. Well, anyway, you're off by two thousand years. I'm two thousand three hundred years old. We were married very young. I was only a hundred and seventeen, and he was a hundred and twenty eight. So you see, we scarcely have to move anymore, let alone work. That's right. A break in the skin or a cut can be fatal. Now, Doctor! I don't know how I can ever thank you, not only for Platonius, but for myself. Alexander, show our guests to the south wing. Gentle spacemen, we are eternally in your debt. We've some trifles for you. Please accept them as tokens of our gratitude. They stem from the very source of our inspiration. To our noble captain, the shield carried by Pericles, as a symbol of gallant leadership. To our silent and cerebral Mister Spock, this kithara to pluck music, to soothe his ever-active brow. And lastly, to the physician Doctor McCoy, who saved Platonius and my spouse, this ancient collection of Greek cures, penned by Hippocrates himself. Why even discuss it? Get rid of them. You must be joking, Doctor. Parmen, let's get on with it. Parmen. What's going on?"
7639,TOS,episode 65,ERACLITUS,"It isn't now. I win. I thank you, Dioniyde. Make up your minds. Remember, Cupid's arrow kills Vulcans. Impossible!"
7640,TOS,episode 65,ALEXANDER,"Are you from the spaceship Enterprise? Alexander, at your service. I sing, I dance, I play all variety of games, and I'm a good loser, a very good loser. Please, sir, try to bear that in mind. Now, would you please accompany me? Oh, Platonians. I'm sure you've never heard of us. Our native star is Sahndara. Millennia ago, just before it went nova, we managed to escape. Our leader liked Plato's ideas Plato, Platonius. See? In fact, our present philosopher-king, Parmen, sometimes calls us Plato's children, although we sometimes think of ourselves more as Plato's stepchildren. Excuse me. Someone's waiting for you. Philana, they came to help. They deserve better than to die. Your Pan is in jeopardy. Help! Save me! His mind will find me anyhow. Don't save him. Let him die. The others will kill each other trying to take his place. I can't breathe. I'm choking. Anything you want, Just ask me. Anything. Think nothing of it. You saved my life. I think I should tell you that Well, just that I never knew any people like you existed. They're all in chambers, meditating. What do you mean, like me? I thought you were talking about my size, because they make fun of me for my size. But, to answer your question, I'm the only one without it. I was brought here as the court buffoon. That's why I'm everybody's slave and I have to be ten places at once, and I never do anything right. As far as I know it just comes to you sometime after you're born. They say I'm a throwback, and I am, and so are you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. You know, I believe you are. Listen, where you come from, are there a lot of people without the power and my size? Nobody? Somebody wants me. Great Pan sounds his horn. Marking time to the rhyme with his hoof, with his hoof. Forward, forward in our plan. We proceed as we began. βρεκεκεκεξ κοαξ κοαξ Parmen, they saved your life. I'm ashamed to be a Platonian. Ashamed! He's right. I should have warned you. They were treating you the same way they treat me. Just like me, only you fight them. All the time, I thought it was me, my mind that couldn't move a pebble. They even told I was lucky they bothered keep me around at all, and I believed them. The arms and legs of everybody's whim. Look down, don't meet their eyes. Smile. Smile. These great people, they were gods to me. But you showed me what they really are. And now I know, don't you see. It's not me, it's not my size, it's them! It's them! It's them! No. This is the best thing for them. I'm going to cut their I'm going to cut them. Parmen first, and they'll all get infected. But this time, listen, whatever they say, don't save them. Let them die. At least let me give them a taste of what they gave me. Please, they're going to kill you anyway. You know that. That's the first time anybody ever thought of my life before his own. I should have told you when you first came here that they were going to kill you. Because I knew, but I was afraid. I was afraid. Anything I can do to help, you just tell me. No, not until we came to this planet. How could I forget that? It was exactly six months and fourteen days after we got here that they started pushing me around. Well, four, I think. Or three. That's right. Not that I'm afraid or anything, but will it hurt much? Oh. You mean the same thing that kept me from having the power made me a dwarf? He's right. Do you know, Parmen says each has his own separate power frequency, because before when they've tried to combine their powers, and use them together, it never worked. Oh, no. Not after what they've done to me. You think that's what I want? Become one of them? Become my own enemy? Just lie around like a big blob of nothing and have things done for me? I want to move around for myself. If I'm going to laugh or cry, I want do it for myself. You can keep your precious power. All I ask is one thing. If you do make it out of here, take me with you. Just drop me any place they never heard of kironide or Platonius. Don't stop me. Let me finish him off. Parmen, listen to me. I could have had your power, but I didn't want it. I could have had your place right now, but the sight of you and your Academicians sickens me. Despite your brains, you're the most contemptible things that ever lived in this universe."

7655,TOS,episode 66,SPOCK,"Evidently a civilisation of high order, rating number seven on the industrial scale. Humanoid in appearance, according to the paintings. An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated and processed. Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy while others are apparently long abandoned. Instrument readings indicate life-form, but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature. They have no discernible form or location. A most puzzling phenomenon, Captain. I shall have to study it further. Unknown at present, Captain. It is logical to assume that this distress call was pre-recorded. What we received was evidently a delayed taped message. It would seem that some force or agent only partially discernible to our instruments may have been responsible. Captain, I have a reading from Life Support centre I have a reading from Life Support centre. Alien substances being introduced. It is a force field, Captain, the nature of which I'm not familiar with. I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact location. It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter. I should advise caution. Unknown, Captain. But it is evidently a device of alien origin. Life support is still operating. I would say that the installation is incomplete. It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all. Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us. Affirmative. Computer, analyse and reply. Have we been invaded? Nature and description of enemy forces. Number of enemy forces. Purpose of the invasion? Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance? Are we at present capable of resisting? Your recommendation? Your recommendations, Captain? Lieutenant, did you see what happened? Mister Sulu, do you verify? I'm getting a trace reading similar to that on the planet. Mister Sulu, did you drink your coffee? Did anyone else? May I? I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed. I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the next step. It would seem they have taken it. And we must determine effective countermeasures. Mister Scott, you have the conn. I shall be in the medical lab. Nurse, programme the information and determine whether we can find counteragents. Doctor, did you just I know what it is. We brought it with us from Scalos. If you'll excuse me, I shall be on the bridge. Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian distress call on my viewer? Spock here. Bring it to the bridge at once, Doctor. Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew. Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level. That is a very logical suggestion. Stand by in the transporter room. Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively. By drinking the Scalosian water. It is somewhat stimulating. You seem to be moving very slowly, Doctor. Fascinating. If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of Scalos, madam, we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the Enterprise. Doctor McCoy and I have synthesised a possible counteragent to the Scalosian water. Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to test it. You do seem to be moving very slowly, Captain. Thank you, Captain. I found it an accelerating experience."

They are pleading for immediate assistance. Malfunction, sir. Captain. It corrected itself. The tape is ready, sir. That would explain our continuing to receive it while our sensors only picked up the landing party, sir. Captain, intercom system is breaking down rapidly. Captain. Captain Kirk! He's gone! Well, he was sitting there. He'd just drunk his coffee and set his cup down. You see it's still there. And then he vanished. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

Captain's presence for examination is requested. Your orders, Jim. You're the last one. Can we discuss it here? Tell the captain what you told me. Lie down, Jim. All perfectly normal. Whatever happened to Compton down there apparently had no effect on anyone else. No. There's no mention of it. I'm not finished yet. What do you mean? Physically, there's nothing wrong with you. I'd say no. There's no question about it, Spock. I want you to take a look at this. The same substance is in the captain's coffee as in the Scalosian water, and there's no trace of it in any other cups. I've been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to Scalos. Compton! I was looking at him. I was looking right at him, and then he just wasn't there My tricorder doesn't register it. This is a barren world. Limited vegetation, no apparent animal life. McCoy to Spock. I've found a tape in the computer down here, and when I try to read it, all I get is a whine. Finished. Most effectively under laboratory conditions, but the question is will it work in the human body? And the second question is, how do we get it to the captain? Spock, you don't know what that'll do to you. Just like Compton."

7668,TOS,episode 66,SCOTT,"They register something, sir, but I'm blessed if I can figure out what it is. I can't get a fix on it. Sensors don't pinpoint a location. We may have a malfunction. I'm about to check circuits, sir. Aye, sir. Is Mister Spock still down there? Aye. I had some. Was it the coffee? Are we going to go too, just like the captain? By that time it'll be too late. Can we use phasers to cut through that wall, bypass the force field and get at that unit? Can we find some way of coping with them on theirs? Captain Kirk, where the blazes did you come from? And Mister Spock, is he coming too? This panel is being recircuited at incredible speed."
7669,TOS,episode 66,KIRK,"Kirk to Enterprise. What do your sensors read? Specify. You do that. Lieutenant Uhura, does the location of the distress call correspond with this area Exactly? Check co-ordinates. Is it the same area? Well, apart from the landing party, there's no one here. There are no Scalosians. Check circuits for malfunctions. Kirk out. When we've run analysis, we should have some explanation. But there is an insect life. It registers in my ears. Nothing, Mister Spock? No sign of present life? Something was here. We saw them on the screen. Lieutenant Uhura is still getting a distress call. What happened? Mister Spock, I want you to run a survey, a complete survey of the planet using all ship's available instruments. What happened? MCCOY; I was looking at him. I was looking right at him, and he. And he just wasn't there! Lieutenant Uhura, start a replay of the distress call. Scotty, are the transporter controls functioning now? No, he's in Sickbay. Doctor McCoy is running a check on the landing party. What is it, Lieutenant? Mister Sulu, I would like Have repair crews been assigned? Play it. Freeze it. The fact remains, when we beamed down there we couldn't find these people. They were there, now they're not. Nor is Crewman Compton. Mister Sulu, I want the ship on standby alert while we continue the investigation. Scotty, assist. Mister Spock, ever since we beamed up from Scalos, we've had a series of malfunctions. I want an investigation and an explanation. Can't it wait, Bones? What do you read so far? On my way. Mister Spock, you have the conn. What is it? Anything missing? Thank you. That fits in with other disturbances. Bones, what did your readings show up on the other men? Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming? Hold on. Bones, could something be making me hallucinate? I mean that twice before something touched me, and there was nothing there. And it's just happened again. Could I be imagining it? But am I hallucinating? Then we did beam something aboard. Something has invaded the ship. Kirk to Spock. Come in. Spock, come in. Spock, I can't hear you. Check your circuits. Is there a malfunction? Lieutenant, ship wide order. Use communicators instead of intercom. Issue phasers to all crew members. Spock, repeat. Meet me there on the double. Spock? Phasers on stun. Sweep the area. What is it? Hooked into the life support. Designed to affect it. Disconnect it. Destroy it. That was no force field. Something shoved me back. They're in here. You! What are you doing on my ship? Show yourselves! A show of strength. Have your readings been fed into the computer? Read out. We will not negotiate. Do you concur? Mister Spock? Yeoman, is that coffee available, or have those circuits been damaged as well? My recommendation? Make them take the next step. then everything around him slows down and finally stops.) Spock? Would you mind explaining Who are you? You're the enemy? What have you done with my men? Nothing? Mister Spock? Scotty. This is nothing? Lieutenant. Sulu. This is nothing? What have you done? Why? Deela. Is this why you sabotaged my ship? You said we? What about my ship? My crew? This won't kill you, but the stun effect is not very pleasant. If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights? Take out that device in the life-support system? Compton, did they accelerate you? They hooked something into the life support system. They're in there. We've got to get rid of it. By whose order? I'm your commander, Compton. I order you to let me in. Who is? Deela? Is that who you're working for? All right, Compton. What is that device doing on my ship? Approve of it? We're your prisoners. He was so young. This is what you have planned for us? Kirk to Spock, I have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks. Hyperacceleration is the key. I have counted only five of them aboard, but they have taken over the ship, and we are under their control due to this acceleration. They are able to speed others up to their level, as they did Compton and me. Presumably, this is enslavement? Those so treated exist at this accelerated level, becoming docile eventually. But when Damaged, they age incredibly fast, as though accelerated living Burns them out. Compton was burned out. The device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze for purposes only the Scalosians know. The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative. Why are you doing this? I really want to know. What about the rest of my crew? Not by killing others. You invaded my ship. You threaten my crew. There is a difference! Your trouble is in you. Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way? Deela, have your scientists disconnect, destroy that unit. I promise you, we'll use every skill we have to help you. We'll move you to another planet. We'll call on the most brilliant minds in our Federation to help. We'll do it I panicked. I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended animation device. It was working before. Try it again. The technicians reported a loss of power. That must be it. Yes, of course. I believe in honest relationships myself. A room should reflect its occupant. Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look. A bit. But now. Was I too crude? Yes. I know. What happened? There is an insect life. My ears register it. This device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze. The unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative. No. No. Yes, I hope so. I said I hoped I behaved correctly. Why are we here? Oh, yes. That was wrong of me. But we are going to Scalos? Oh, yes. They'll be all right. What's the matter? Am I behaving incorrectly? Those are undesirable qualities. I'm sorry. We could put you in suspended animation until we determine what to do with you. No, it doesn't. What do you want us to do with you? If I sent you to Scalos, you'd undoubtedly play the same trick on the next spaceship that passed by. Yes, I suppose it would. And very brief. Oh, no. I can think of nothing I'd rather do than stay with you. Except staying alive. Energise. Well, Mister Spock, what have you got? Let's test it. Nothing's happening. Mister Spock. Out of the nowhere into the here. Scotty. Captain's log, Stardate 5710.9. Mister Spock has remained in accelerated time so that he might repair the ship more rapidly. I think we've located Mister Spock. Lieutenant, are your circuits clearing? Cancel Red Alert, Mister Sulu. Open all channels. Captain to crew. Repairs are now being effected by Mister Spock. The ship will resume normal operations almost immediately. Mister Spock, my compliments to your repair work and yourself. Yes. No malfunctions anywhere? Lieutenant. That's no malfunction.

At first I refused, but then after a while I found I couldn't help myself. I met this girl. She's one of them. I've never known anyone like her. She brought me aboard to show them operation of the ship. Bridge controls, life support. She explained that they wanted to know. I didn't understand at first, but I do now. So will you, sir. I tried to stop him. You hurt him. He was my captain."
8049,TOS,episode 66,RAEL,"To any and all space travellers passing within range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent appeal for help. My comrades and I are the last surviving members of what was once a thriving civilisation. Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area. We have no explanation for what has been happening to us. Our number is now five. We were once a nation of nine hundred thousand. Stun. You were ordered to stop him. Why did you disobey? He was violent. He had to be subdued. Another will be secured for you. It may be. He is inferior, Deela. You cannot allow yourself to feel an attachment to such. I do my duty. Deela will explain it. Go ahead, Captain. It is not yet completely linked to your support system, but it is in operating order. Study it if you wish. I suggest that you do not touch it. The unit has its own self-defence mechanism, as you see. You should've heeded me. In your struggle with Compton, some of his cells were damaged. Those newly accelerated to our level are sensitive to cell damage. They age rapidly and die. Was. Perhaps he will be less violent now. Why do you care what he feels? I have noted that. Go to the transporter room, Deela. Signal me when you're there and beam down. Yes. I'll activate our unit and follow you. I'm setting it to allow all of us time to get off the ship. Please don't delay. Go after him, Deela. Beam him down at once. What'd he do to it? I heard him. You expect me to believe him? To any and all space travellers passing within range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent appeal for help. My comrades and I are the last surviving members of what was once a thriving civilisation. Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area. We have no explanation for what's happening to us. Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area. We have no explanation for what's happening to us. Nation of nine hundred thousand. City alone holding one hundred thirteen thousand. On which existed several culturally enlightened Indigenous population This is the only damage? Go get the others and bring them up here. Deela. Deela? Deela! Then don't torment me. You know how I feel. No. I have more work to do. I've beamed the others down. It would've been an intrusion. Come up when you wish. Signal me when you are ready. In life support. I have to activate our unit. I know. The unit is activated, Deela. Beam down at once."
8050,TOS,episode 66,DEELA,"Captain. Deela. The enemy. Yes. You beamed me aboard yourself when you came up. A ridiculously long process, but I've taken care of it. Nothing. There's really nothing wrong with them. They are just as they have always been. It's you who are different. They cannot hear you, Captain. To their ears, you sound like an insect. That's your description, Captain. Accurate, if unflattering. Really, there is nothing wrong with them. Changed you. So you are like me now. Your crew cannot see you or any of us because of the acceleration. We move in the wink of an eye. Oh, there is a scientific explanation for it, but all that really matters is that you can see me and talk to me, and we can go on from there. Because I like you. Didn't you guess? Or are you so accustomed to being kissed by invisible women? Oh, but it has not been sabotaged. We we had to make some changes in it to adjust it to us. Yes. Of course. My chief scientist and his crew. I am their queen. You are going to be their king. You'll enjoy living on Scalos. Oh, in a few of their moments, they will realise that you've vanished. They will look for you, but they will not find you. You're accelerated far beyond their power to see. So they'll go on without you. Don't be so stubborn. You cannot go back to them, ever. Is it so dreadful a prospect? But that won't work. You go ahead and try. Point it right at me. My reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon. And I am quite good at self-defense, too. This can be set for stun and destroy, too, like yours. Please, accept what has happened. There is nothing you can do to change it. Don't be so silly. You'll feel better about it all in a little while. It always happens this way. They are very upset at first, then it wears off and they, they learn to like it. You will, too. I hate what happens to them when they're damaged. You're going to have to learn to control your temper, Rael. I do not want that to happen to this one. If they are so stubborn a species, perhaps they will last longer. I hope so. They all go so soon. I want to keep this one a long time. He's pretty. Oh? I don't think so. I can allow myself anything I want. Oh, Rael, don't be like that. Am I jealous of what you do? So do I. And sometimes I allow myself to enjoy it. Hello. I will tell you anything you want to know, and you'll approve of it. Hardly. You're free to go anywhere you want to. He told you not to touch it. Look at your hands. They're almost frozen, aren't they? It will pass. We all die, even on Scalos. Why did you lie to him? He did not damage that one, you did. I see no reason to make him feel any worse than he has to. Rael, he's not one of us. He's temporary. He's gone to the medical laboratory. He's trying to communicate with the Vulcan. His species is capable of much affection. I wonder if they will demonstrate it to us. Oh, Rael, stop sulking. Accept it. We've had to accept it all our lives. Don't make it worse. Go back to work. Go ahead. You won't accomplish anything, but it may be historically valuable. Damaged. Burns them out. Quite correct. The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this, it will be too late. You have remarkable reasoning powers, Captain. You were quite right in almost every assumption. Do you really want to know? In a little while it won't matter to you at all. You'll be quite happy about it, Just as Compton was. Oh, dear. You are so stubborn. It should be obvious to you that we're doing it because we have to. A long time ago, it is in our history, we used to be like you. Then our country was almost destroyed by volcanic eruptions. The water was polluted. Radiation was released. That changed us. It accelerated us. The children died. Most of the women found they could not have more. All of our men had become sterile. So we had to mate outside our own people. Whenever a spaceship came by, we'd send our calls for help. But accelerating them to our level burned them out. Don't you see, Captain? Do I have to go into every detail? We are going to take you down with us. Perhaps one or two others of your crew. We have to. We'll be kind to you. I wouldn't hurt you, certainly. I do like you. They'll remain here in suspended animation. It will do them no harm. We are saving them for when we need them in the future. You will not last forever. You know that, Captain. Captain, we have the right to survive. You were doing exactly the same thing. You came charging into that life-support room the minute you knew there was trouble. You would have killed every one my people if you could have. There is no difference. We did not ask for it. We are not to blame. We are handling it the only way we know how. The way our parents and their parents before them. We have tried other ways. We've tried to make the transition to your level. Some of us, that is. Those who made the attempt died. We are trapped, Captain, Just as you are trapped now. I'm sorry for what's going to happen to you, but I cannot change it. You cannot change me. With the captain? Just what makes you think I would do that? The captain's gone. Why did you run? I don't believe that. We're in the transporter room. You can activate. Captain. What have you done to the transporter, Captain? The transporter isn't working. Nothing. He didn't have time. It must be a, what do you call it? A malfunction. You'd better not activate the unit yet. What would you say it is, Captain? The captain says his technicians I expect you to check into all possible causes. If I had a suspicious nature, Captain, I would say that you sabotaged the transporter to buy time. I'm glad we're both innocents. I despise devious people, don't you? Your quarters are quite like you, Captain. Austere and efficient, and in their own way, handsome. Absolutely. May I freshen up? All this rushing about has left me windblown. I'm glad to see you allow yourself some comforts. Are you married, Captain? No family? No attachments? I know. You're married to your career, and you never look at another woman. I wondered when you'd say something nice to me. Am I more presentable now? It was quite delightful kissing you when you couldn't see me. But now No. I wouldn't allow you to take that no matter how much we trust each other. But I would've been disappointed if you hadn't tried. Just don't try it again. You're far too vulnerable to skin damage. All I have to do is scratch you. The difference between us is that you will come around to our way of thinking sooner or later. But it's better sooner than later. The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this, it will be too late. Rael! Rael, stop. Now, stop it. Did he damage you, Captain? How very fortunate for you, Rael. Don't you dare do anything like that again. It's contemptible. I don't care what your feelings are. I don't want to know that aspect of it. What I do is necessary, and you have no right to question it. Allow me the dignity of liking the man I select. Is the transporter repaired? Don't you think you'd better do it? He loves me. I adored him when I was a child. I suppose I still do. I must say, you behaved better than he did. What did you say? And nothing bothers you now? Our leaving was delayed. Don't you remember? You damaged the transporter. Yes, it certainly was. Do you want to? What about your crew? Aren't you worried about them? Oh. Nothing. You've completely accepted the situation, haven't you? You even like it. No! I liked you better before. Stubborn and irritating and independent, like Rael. Maybe that's why I liked you so much. Because you were like him. Rael? You don't have to worry about the captain. He's made the adjustment. Is it repaired already? Why didn't you tell me? Where will you be? Rael, wait. I'm sorry. Well, come, Captain. It's time to leave your pretty ship. Your crew will be all right. You said so yourself. He's broken away. He's armed. RAEL; I'm ready for him. You are very clever, Captain. You tricked me. I should've known that you would never adjust. What shall we expect from you now? Your survival does not depend on that. Don't make a game of it, Captain. We've lost. There won't be any others. You'll warn them. Your federation will quarantine the entire area. And we will die and solve your problem that way. And ours. Now, what about your problem, Captain, and your Vulcan friend? You could still find life on Scalos very pleasant. It'll be just as brief here. You cannot get back to your own level. No answer, Captain? Do I displease you so much? Goodbye, Captain."

Remember, Captain, what we see on this tape happened approximately three months ago. Negative, Captain. It doesn't register. Exactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet surface, Captain. Residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by a matter-energy scrambler, similar to our own transporter mechanism. Captain, picking up a life-form reading bearing four two mark seven. Negative. Although humanoid, it is definitely not Homo Sapiens. Impossible. I can make no exact identification other than it being humanoid. Approaching the life-form, Captain. Still undistinguishable. The sand-bats of Manark Four appear to be inanimate rock crystals, Doctor, until they attack. From what we know of the specific gravity and other environmental factors of this planet, a life-form such as hers could not evolve here. An unlikely possibility, Captain, since over ninety eight percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them. She's made no attempt to contact our minds. Gem, Doctor? Correct, Captain. Captain, in that direction, my tricorder is now picking up a substantial collection of objects. Electronically sophisticated devices. I fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there. Fascinating. Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction. Research station six kilometres in that direction, Captain. Just ahead. I believe they were never actually present, Doctor. It was a mirage. Captain, it was a mirage. Captain, I request permission to be allowed Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings. I can find no exit out of here. Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor. Only your urging her on caused her to continue. Can you recall what happened, Captain? Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the Vian's laboratory. I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source. If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates, I might be able to cause it to function for us. I would say so. I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its operating principles, but that is all. Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface. I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder, Doctor. Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments. Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to do so. How long will he be asleep, Doctor? I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm quite grateful for it. The captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision. You have simplified the situation considerably. While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians return, I shall go with them. Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is mine. Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands. I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good doctor's hypo. Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a control mechanism. In fact, it is not a mechanical device. This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it. It is activated solely by mental commands. I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time. I am, of course, most familiar with my own pattern. Therefore, with your permission, I Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it. The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go. That is evidently their intention, Captain. Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to their purpose. Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not survive more than even one use. However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise. If you so desire. Severe heart damage. Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence of massive circulatory collapse. He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all. Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen. Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver. Seventy percent kidney failure. It could happen anytime. I'm afraid not. Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it. However, we cannot be positive. What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to bring you pleasure? Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct. Your sun will nova. Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed. You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them. This has all been a great laboratory, and we have been the subjects of the test. Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem. The Vians too must be capable of saving his life. Captain? The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field. It draws its energy from us, Captain. In spite of what we see, all emotion must be suppressed. That might weaken the field. It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for her planet. She offered her life. What is puzzling you, Captain? Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the Vians. Possibly, Captain. I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due."

And I don't think it's a pathological condition. She appears to be perfectly healthy. As for the other, her lack of vocal cords could be physiologically normal for her species, whatever that is. That's my observation, for whatever it's worth. We can't keep referring to her as she, as if she weren't here. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to call her Gem. Well, that's better than 'Hey, you.' Don't fight the force field. There's something about it that upsets the body metabolism. Do you feel all right, Jim? The wound is completely healed. It fits, Jim. She must be an empath. Her nervous system is so sensitive, highly responsive that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions. They become part of her. Look at this stuff. Jim, Spock. We've seen the results of some of your tests. Hey, Jim, look. Scotty and a search party. Scotty! We're coming! Where'd they go? Where's Kirk? Jim. You can't go back there.

Don't be afraid to help him. Jim. You lie still. I'll check her out right away. She seems fine now. Complete empathy. She must be a totally functional empath. Her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms and with her strength, she virtually sustained your body's physiological reactions. It's impossible to say yet, but supplying your body with life support did drain her. That's true. Fear would naturally be her first reaction. Perhaps she doesn't know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him. Oh yes. However, I'd assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it. How do you feel? Take it easy. You have all the symptoms of the bends. Nitrogen bubbles in your blood caused the pain. Now how would one get the bends down here? Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber. But otherwise, I'd say your recovery is about miraculous. I wish I could take the credit for it, but she did the work. Spock, why do you have to get so analytical at a time like Spock, It won't be long before the Vians come back. You better find out how that thing works and soon. Men weren't intended to live this far underground. It's just not natural. I'm a doctor, not a coal miner. I'm not a mechanic. I couldn't get that thing to work no matter how many notes you left. In any case, Spock, you're the logical one to leave with the captain. I'm still Chief Medical Officer of the Enterprise. I'll tell you what you need and when you need it. Would you rather have the bends? That's it. Just lie down and relax. Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in pretty bad shape. How? You mean, if I hadn't given him that shot Not this time, Spock. The choice has been made. You stay here with my friends. They'll take care of you. Do you understand? Get on with it. I He's right, Jim. Being a doctor has its drawbacks. I always wondered why I Thanks. The correct medical phrase, ay, Spock? You've got a a good bedside manner, Spock. Don't touch me. Stay away. Jim. Spock. Are you here? Don't let her touch me. She'll die. Jim, I can't destroy life, even if it's to save my own. I can't. You know that. I can't let you do it. I'm with you, Captain. She awed me. Well, personally, I find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances, that it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most."

8078,TOS,episode 67,SULU,"Aye, sir. Readings now indicate two point seven two one on the Ritter scale. At the present rate of decrease, we'll have to wait at least seventeen hours more before we can even attempt to enter orbit. The storm's already lasted four hours longer than we've anticipated. Do you suppose our landing party could be in any danger? Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor two. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

8079,TOS,episode 67,SCOTT,"Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Come in, please. Scott here, sir. Our instruments have picked up a gigantic solar flare With very high levels of cosmic rays accompanying it. An enormous one. Our sensors indicate the cosmic ray concentration measures three point five one on the Ritter scale. That'll play the very devil with the crew, as well as the ship. Aye, aye, sir. We'll beam you up in Very well, sir. Scott out. Mister Sulu, will you give us an estimate of how much longer we'll have until those solar flares will subside? Aye. Well, as long as we're stuck out here, we might as well relax until the storm passes. That's not likely. The planet's atmosphere will give them ample protection. And if I know Captain Kirk, he'll be more worried about us than we are about him. Not to dispute your computer, Mister Spock, but from little what you've told me, I would say she was a pearl of great price. Do you not know the story of the merchant? The merchant, who when he found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it. Perhaps the Vulcans should hear about this."
8080,TOS,episode 67,KIRK,"Record tape. Maybe it'll tell us something about the personnel that lived here. Kirk here. What is it, Enterprise? How bad? Get that ship out of here. Stay at minimum distance for absolute safety. Negative. We're staying here. The atmosphere will protect us. Get that ship out of here, Mister Scott. Mister Spock, what about that tape? Where's does that sound coming from? Spock, can you pinpoint it? Bones! Spock! Spock. Bones. Where are we? How did we get here? No. One of the missing scientists? Identification? Let's find out. Phasers on stun. What is it? Be careful. We're not going to hurt you. Is this your home? Do you live here? What about it, Spock? Analysis. Are you responsible for bringing us here? Don't be afraid. Bones, what's wrong with her? Explain. A race of mutes, like the civilisation on Gamma Vertis Four. Without speech, how's she going to be able to understand us? Unless she's a telepath. Do you have any ideas? I want to know why we're here. I want to know what's going on. And she knows. I'm Captain Who are you? Why did you bring us here? What do you intend to do with us? We come Since you already know who we are, you must also know that we come in peace. Our prime directive specifically prohibits us from any interference.) I can't seem to stand up. Mister Spock there must be an exit other than the one we just saw. Don't worry about me. They may have hurt her. Did they hurt you? The pain is gone. She touched my head, and the pain is gone. Thank you. Details. Well they're there now. Let's go check them out. Staying here alone could be dangerous. Come with us. Bones Spock, come here. I found our missing men. Dead. Another one of your experiments? Yes. Your time is running out. This sun is about to nova. When it does, it'll destroy you, this planet, and this insane torture chamber. Let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Out of range. Readings, Mister Spock? Let's get there as fast as we can. If the Enterprise has a search party, it'll be there. Spock! Much further? Scotty! Stay there! Come on! Keep going. What are you doing here? Where's Scotty? What about the others? Very well. Denied. You have your orders. What happened to my men? One specimen, you said. One specimen! What happened to my men? Where are they? Tell me! You said you'd let them go! What is it you want to know? You don't need any knowledge from us, yet you're willing to kill for it. Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba? Well, what did you expect from them? And what do you want from me? Why? What is it you hope to prove? If my death is to have any meaning, at least tell me what I'm dying for. Will she live? Can you explain what happened? She weakened. I could feel it. Is her life in danger? Could the strain really have killed her? I'm tired. I remember the laboratory, and they wanted to know something. But I, I can't remember. What's the matter with me? You'll have to ask the Vians. Will I live? No, he's right. Continue. Can you tap into it? And get us out of here the same way we were brought in. Then I would say proceed. It is. We will not co-operate. How's it coming, Spock? Take it easy, Bones. And space travel is? The decision's mine. If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them. If and when it becomes necessary. I don't need any Why did you let him do it? Anything? What exactly is it? Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern? Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock. What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it. And that we would use it to escape. And they keep McCoy. Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this. Even before we got here, she was a prisoner. They didn't hurt her, they didn't even threaten her. Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen for you? Will it take us to McCoy? The best defence is a strong offense, and I intend to start offending right now. Aim for the lab. Bones. Spock. Get him down. His wrists. His pulse is almost gone. How is he? Don't talk. Don't speak. Take it easy until we get you back to the ship. What is it? What's the matter? You don't know. You're not a doctor. How long? Can't we do something? Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could his nearness to death also kill her? If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death, we might be able to save him. She can save his life. Let us help her to go to him. What purpose can all this serve, except the fulfilment of some need of yours? Patient? Our friend is dying. This arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure. Will it prevent this catastrophe? How will the death of our friend serve this purpose? We were? What could she learn from us? Then you cannot let him die. Yes, Bones. What is it? Yes, I know. I'll try. Yes. Spock. You must save the life of our friend. If death is all you understand, here are four lives for you. We will not leave our friend. You've lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience. You don't understand what it is to live. Love and compassion are dead in you. You're nothing but intellect. Strange. I'm not puzzled, Mister Spock. I am awed. No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem. I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem. What, Scott? Yes, she was all that. And whether the Vians bought her or found her makes little difference. She was of great value. Mister Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news? Mister Sulu, ahead warp factor two."

We are on schedule. Some further simple tests are necessary. You're wrong. Their own imperfections killed them. They were not fit subjects. Come. Time is short. Their will to survive is great. The prime ingredient. We've no interest in them. They may go. They are safe. We seek no information as you mean. Your civilisation is yet too immature to have knowledge valuable to us. We've already observed the intensity of your passions and gauged your capacity to love others. Now we want you to reveal to us your courage and strength of will. You are called Captain. You are responsible for the lives of your crew. Is this correct? When we resume our interrogations, you will decide which of your men we shall use. It is essential. There is an eighty seven percent chance that the doctor will die. And while Commander Spock's life is not in danger, the possibility is ninety three percent that he will suffer brain damage, resulting in permanent insanity. Doctor, please understand that if there was any other way to accomplish our purpose No interference will be permitted. She must not be urged or forced to take action. The purpose that brought us together We have but one need left in life, and that is to see the completion of the final moment of our test. That is why we are here. No, it will not, but it may save Gem's planet. Of all the planets of Minara, we have the power to transport the inhabitants of only one to safety. His death will not serve it, but her willingness to give her life for him will. You were her teachers. Your will to survive. Your love of life. Your passion to know. They are recorded in her being. Each of you is willing to give his life for the others. We must now find out whether that instinct has been transmitted to Gem. Your actions were spontaneous. Everything that is truest and best in all species of beings has been revealed by you. Those are the qualities that make a civilisation worthy to survive. Compassion for another is becoming part of her functioning life system. She's saving herself. She does not yet have the instinct to save her people. No. No, not yet. His death is not important. We must wait to see whether her instinct for self-sacrifice has become stronger than her instinct for self-preservation. You cannot use our powers to change what is happening. No. We will not. Her instinct must be developed to the fullest. The test must be complete. To offer is not proof enough. Farewell."

We find it necessary to have the co-operation of one of your men in our efforts. Come, then. All must proceed without interference. Be patient. Perhaps. We know. If Gem's planet is the one that will be saved, we must make certain beyond any doubt whatsoever they are worthy of survival. Her planet will be fortunate. Time grows short. No. We only created the circumstances. That was necessary. Behold. That is most significant. An instinct new to the essence of her being is generating. She is afraid. We have failed? True."

The scientists who made the initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant. Not without precedent, Captain. Remember that I am the first officer. This is Captain James Kirk. Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided. I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational. At first it appeared to be a sensor ghost, but I've run checks on all the instrumentation. All the equipment is functioning perfectly. None in this area. Nothing that would account for it. The ghost appears intermittently. None, Captain. Insufficient data. Bridge to Captain. That sensor ghost is moving closer. Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object enough to establish it was a spaceship. No data yet. Our ghost has materialised. Negative, Captain. The Klingon ship has simply moved into contact range. She is pacing us, precisely matching our sublight speed and on a parallel course. Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless, anticipating that she would deny you admittance. However, the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me. I have it on my sensor, Lieutenant. Spock here, Captain. I am triangulating now. It's coming from the engineering section. Spock here, Captain. Captain? Captain. May we see you a moment? Captain, are you all right? It is true then, Captain? Their speed is better than warp six, Captain. I don't think they meant to attack us. We were very fortunate this time. Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this system so vital? I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman at a time like this? They demand an immediate reply. We can still manoeuvre. Help could not arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed. He's passed us. All shields held. Better than warp seven. He's past us again. Damage to number four shield. It will not withstand another full charge, Captain. I'm getting some very peculiar energy readings. She is the source. The necklace. These are common stones? See, Captain? Here and here. No doubt, Captain. Captain, these are crude crystals. There is no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow. Damage to Klingon number three shield. Number four shield obliterated. Loss of manoeuvre power. You are too late, Doctor. The Captain has found his own antidote. The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship. The Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did. In this particular instance, Doctor, I agree with you."

They're supposed to have a kind of subtle, mystical power that drives men wild. It was a deep wound, Jim. He lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover. Well, I've heard of reluctant brides, but this is ridiculous. The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried to murder the groom's ambassador. It'll be a few days. A week, at least, Jim. Neck snapped clean. Jim. Jim! May we please have a word with you? Did she cry, Jim? Did she cry? Did her tears touch you at any time? Oh, we're in trouble. Now listen, Jim. Petri told Christine that the Elasian women have a sort of a biochemical substance in their tears that acts like a super love potion. And according to him, it doesn't wear off. I'll try, but I'll need tests and Results also negative. It is my time to waste, Ambassador. That is the captain's responsibility, Ambassador. Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian tears. It's a kind of an infection, and I think I've found an antidote. Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

You'll not be using the warp drive? All the way on impulse? That'll take a great deal of time. No. Engineering to Captain Kirk. Captain, I know what you said about showing respect, but must I have these persons fool around with my equipment? Well, I suppose, lassie, that even our impulse engines must seem fast compared to your nuclear propulsion units. Menials? Without engines, there'd be no fighting or Nobody saw him, but that devil sneaked back in here some way. Watson must've caught him and he was killed for it. He had this. Looks like some sort of transmitter. Captain, you must realise the time Aye. Captain, the matter-antimatter The anti-matter pods are rigged to blow up the moment we go into warp drive. Not without being blown halfway across the galaxy. Scott to Captain. I've got bad news, Captain. The entire dilithium crystal converter assembly is fused. No chance of repair. It's completely unusable. Not without dilithium crystals. We can't even generate enough power to fire our weapons. Ninety three percent of impulse power, sir. Manoeuvre? Aye. We can wallow like a garbage scow against a warp-driven starship. Our shields will hold for a few passes, but without the matter-antimatter reactor, we've no chance. Captain, can you not call Starfleet on this emergency? No, sir, not a chance. We're fitting it now, sir, but we'll have to run a few tests to make sure. Aye, that could blow us up just as effectively as Scott to Captain. It's in place, sir, but I can't answer for what happens. Fluctuation. It's the shape of the crystals. I was afraid of that. She won't steady down. It's stabilised now."
8495,TOS,episode 68,KIRK,"Some desk-bound Starfleet bureaucrat cut these cloak-and-dagger orders. My orders are to co-operate with Ambassador Petri in all matters pertaining to his mission here. Scotty. Kirk here. What is it? Demand? What delay? All right. Beam them aboard. Ambassador Petri, would you drop all this nonsense and tell me what this is about? Dohlman? What the devil is a Dohlman? I'm Captain Kirk. This ship is under my command. This ship is secure and we're prepared for any hostile acts. Energise. Body armour, nuclear weapons. Well, now, just a moment. There's going to have to be some kind of understanding. My first officer Mister Spock will show you to your quarters. Ambassador, I'd like to speak to you. May I have your permission to go? Why, thank you. Ambassador. Ambassador, I think it's time you told me what's going on. I see. So, we go back to Troyius. And you are to be her teacher? Yes, that I can understand. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius. Mister Sulu, impulse drive, speed factor point zero three seven. Yes, that's correct, Mister Sulu. Sublight factor point zero three seven. You in a hurry, Mister Scott? Yes, I appreciate your sacrifice, Lieutenant Uhura. I'll talk to her myself. I understand you're not happy with your quarters. Yes, not happy at all. My communications officer generously vacated the rooms hoping you would find it satisfactory. Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding to instruction. There are none better. I suggest you make do with these. There are no more available, but if that's the only way you can get gratification, I'll arrange to have the whole room filled from floor to ceiling with breakable objects. Then act in a civilised fashion. I didn't ask for any. Ambassador! This is supposed to be a peaceful mission. You're as bad as she is. It's not required that you like each other. Just do your job. Stop trying to kill each other. Then worry about being friendly. Then make her listen, Ambassador. Use a different approach. Stop being so diplomatic. She respects strength. Go in strong. Hydrogen cloud reflection? Speculation? It's not an instrument malfunction. It's not a reflection from a natural phenomenon. A spaceship? Kirk here. Hang on, Scotty. Be pleasant no matter how much it hurts. I'll be right down. Mister Scott! I wish you had told me you wanted a tour of the engineering department. Courtesy. Remember? Courtesy is for everyone around here, and you'll find you won't be able to exist on Troyius without it. Mister Scott, our Chief Engineer, has shown you his engineering department. That's a courtesy. You respond by saying thank you. Kirk here. On my way. Whose? Main screen. Extreme magnification. A Klingon warship. Any change, Mister Spock? Kirk here. What is it? On my way. I said talk with her, not fight with her. Yes. Certainly. What was it? Ambassador, there's an added complication. The Federation High Commissioner will be attending the wedding. I'm not asking you to have anything to do with me. Do your job with her. How long before he's on his feet? Nothing would please me more, Your Glory. But your impetuous nature You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people. You must understand discipline to be able to give and take orders. My orders are to take you to Troyius to be married and to see that you learn Troyian customs. It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. Well, we're still faced with the same problem. Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and manners. You have eliminated the teacher. The problem still remains. By giving you a new teacher. Table manners, for one thing. This is a plate. It contains food. This is a knife. It cuts the food. This is a glass. Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered to learn. That's impossible. That's the first problem we're going to work on. Then we'll get you ready to go to Troyius. You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman. Then be worthy of them. If you don't want the obligations that go along with the title, then give it up. That's another one of your problems. Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman's body, an arrogant monster! That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth. Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy. Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency, identify us, and ask the Klingon his intentions. I see. All right, Lieutenant. Monitor all frequencies. Phaser crews stand by. Maintain Yellow Alert. Where's Kryton? Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit. Thank you, Mister Spock. When they wake up, take them to Security holding. Mister Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim. Only in self-defence. Now, are you going to behave or not? We're not on Elas. We're on my starship. I command here. If I touch you again, Your Glory, it'll be to administer an ancient Earth custom called a spanking, a form of punishment administered to spoiled brats. You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in courtesy. Very well. I'll send in Mister Spock or Doctor McCoy. Either way, you're going to be properly prepared for Troyius. As ordered by councils, rulers, and bureaucrats. No, no, you were right the first time. There's nothing I can teach you. There's nothing you do not know. Well, it's not it's not that people hate you. It's just that people don't like to be treated as though they don't exist. It's, er, gotten very, er. Something must've gone wrong with the ventilation system. Pardon me, Your Glory. There will be a short recess. It's, er, It's, er. We'll talk about it later. Kirk here. Security to Engineering. Intruder alert. Security alert to all decks. Kirk out. It's Klingon. Bones? What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship? Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture. Kirk to Spock. Mister Spock, it was Kryton transmitting. He refuses to talk. I'll need you for the Vulcan mind meld. What was he trying to cover that was so important he felt he had to die for it? Scotty, he didn't come into Engineering just to use the transmitter. I want you to check every relay you've got. Don't waste the time telling me about it. Get to it. He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy? There's a Klingon warship out there. What's their involvement? Surely all of this isn't because they want to stop a marriage. Elaan. Elaan, two planets, an entire star system's stability depends on it. We have a duty to forget what happened. My orders and yours say that you belong to another man. What happened, what happened was an accident. What kind of a mind could think of such a thing? What? It's true. Bones, you've got to find me an antidote. Captain here. I'm on my way. Battle stations. Phasers stand by. Mister Chekov, lay in a course to take us out of this star system. If they want to fight, Let's get some manoeuvering room. All right. Ahead warp factor two. Belay that order. What is it, Scotty? Scotty, that bomb he planted. Can you dismantle it? Give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive, and find a solution to the bomb. Kirk out. Mister Sulu, stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly. She'll be sluggish on response. Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command. Ready. Hold your fire. Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock. They were trying to make us cut in warp drive. That way we'd have blown ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the Federation. Very neat. Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock. I'll be the judge. Yes, you're quite right. Thank you, Mister Spock. I want you to go to Sickbay. It's the best protected part of the ship. Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency, my ability to protect you. Mister Spock, you have the conn. Deck five. If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll gladly do that. Yes. Yes, Elaan. No. Kirk here. No chance of restoring warp drive? Kirk out. Elaan, I have to go back to the Bridge. Please, you must go to Sickbay. They're trying to force a fight. Scotty, what's our energy status? And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines? We'll stall for time, proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed. Or that they're not prepared for a general war. Open a hailing frequency. This is Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise on Federation business. Our mission is peaceful, but we're not prepared to accept any interference. I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective. Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks? I told you to stay in Sickbay. We're not going to die. Now get off the bridge. Mister Sulu, bring her to one four three mark two. Keep our forward shields to him. Stay with the controls. Keep our forward shields to him. Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around. He's going for our flank. Sulu! How bad? What sort of readings, Mister Spock? Elaan? What kind of jewels are in this? Common stones? Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this system. May I have this? You may have just saved our lives. Mister Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals? Mister Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port. Try and protect the number four shield. Now, Sulu. hard a-port! Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. This is Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. May I request your terms for surrender? Scotty, your estimate. Test it in combat. Let me know when it's in place. Open a hailing frequency. This is the Enterprise. Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas? You and Spock get up here. Sulu, prepare for warp manoeuvres. Chekov, arm photon torpedoes. Negative. His sensors will pick up our power increase. The more helpless he thinks we are, the closer he'll come. As he passes, I want to cut in warp drive. We'll pivot at warp two and bring all tubes to bear. Mister Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes. Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive. Fire at minimum range. Warp in, Scotty. Full power to shields. Warp factor two. Bring us to course one four eight mark three. Chekov, photon torpedoes. Fire! Secure from general quarters. Well done, Mister Sulu. Scotty. No. Mister Sulu, resume course for Troyius. No. I have no choice. Goodbye. Energise. Mister Sulu, prepare to take us out of orbit. Ahead warp factor two. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Swine! Take back your gifts! Your ruler cannot buy the favours of the Dohlman of Elas. I want nothing of his! I would strangle if I was to put the gift of a Troyian dog around my neck. Kryton, by whose permission did he enter? Quarters! Am I a soft Troyian fawn to need pillows to sit on? And these ridiculous female trappings. They are an offense to my eyes. I do not find them so, and I find him even less satisfactory. Must my bitterness be compounded with that ridiculous ambassador aboard your ship? Kryton! Remove him! And take that garbage with you? He dares to suggest that I adopt the servile manners of his people! I will never forgive the council for putting me through this torture. Were you responding to my demand for better quarters? You suggest? I will not be humiliated! I did not give you permission to leave! We are interested in how the ship is used in combat, not in what drives it. Engines are for mechanics and menials. Do we not have the freedom of this ship? We have granted your crew the permission not to kneel in our presence. What else do you want? Courtesy is not for inferiors. Kryton, remove that Troyian pig. So, Ambassador Petri is going to recover? That is too bad. You have delivered your message. Now you may go. Your Troyian pig was here in my quarters without any permission, so I stabbed him. Just to be Troyian is enough. I despise Troyians. Any contact with them makes me feel soiled. It's not in my experience. Problem? I have eliminated that problem. Oh. And how do we solve the problem? Tell me, what can you teach me? Leave me! You will return me to Elas immediately. Everything I order is possible. I will not go to Troyius, I will not be mated to a Troyian, and I will not be humiliated, and I will not be given to a green pig as a bribe to stop a war! Nobody speaks to me that way. You dare touch a member of the royal family. The penalty is death for what you are doing. You are warned, Captain, never to touch me again. You have my leave to go. You can teach me nothing, Captain. If I have to stay here for ten light years, I will not be soiled by any contact with you. Captain, there is one thing you can teach me. I don't know how to make people like me. I don't want everybody to hate me. Captain? Captain. Captain, that ancient Earth custom called spanking, what is it? Kryton was of a noble family. He loved me and wanted to marry me. He was furious when he heard of the announcement of the wedding plans. Probably. But why speak of unimportant matters when we can speak about us? We should welcome their help. Could you do that? Could you give me to another man? It was no accident. I chose you, and you chose me. I have a plan. With this ship, you could completely obliterate Troyius. Then there will be no need for the marriage. And in gratitude, my people will give you the complete rule of this system. He's a Troyian. You cannot resist my love, my love. I want to be by your side. I love you. I have chosen you, and still I don't understand why you didn't fight the Klingon. And that mission is to take me to Troyius. Would you have me wearing my wedding dress for another man and never see you again? Are you happy at the prospect? Yes, my love. Doctor? The Captain asked me to come here for safety. That's all you men of other worlds can speak of, duty and responsibility. I want to die with you. They call them radans. The necklace is supposed to bring you luck. It is of little value. They are common stones. If I can be of any help, of course. But I don't understand you. You mean you won't pursue and finish him off? You will not beam down for the ceremony? I want you to have this as a personal memento. I have learned that on Troyius, they do not wear such things. Remember me. Nor have I. I have only responsibilities and obligations. Goodbye."
8883,TOS,episode 68,WATSON,What are you doing?
8884,TOS,episode 68,KRYTON,"There's a Troyian here. I must know that all is secure before the Dohlman is brought on board. Do honour to the Dohlman of Elas. Glory to Elaan, Dohlman of Elas. You may stand. Permission to speak was not given. He came in answer to your summons. Her Glory has not summoned you. Captain, you must know I will tell you nothing. Our interrogation techniques are more excruciating than you are even capable of."
8885,TOS,episode 68,PETRI,"That must wait until the Dohlman is aboard. The thing most feared and hated by my people. Our most deadly enemy. Welcome. I am Petri, Ambassador of Troyius. Your Glory, I am Petri. In the name of my people Please. That creature, Elaan, is to be the wife of our ruler to bring peace. Our two warring planets now possess the capability of mutual destruction. Some method of co-existence must be found. Yes. But slowly, Captain. I will need time. Before we reach there, she must be taught civilised manners. In her present condition, my people would never accept her. Those are my orders. I must ask you and your crew to respect, or at least tolerate, their arrogance. Friction must be kept at a minimum. Another thing you should understand, Captain. You have as much at stake as I have. Your superiors made the statement that failure of this mission would be as catastrophic for Federation planning as it would be for our two planets. To gain peace at the price of accepting such a queen is no victory. I will take her the official gifts I bear. Perhaps that will soften her mood. Your Glory, these are your wedding slippers. This, this is your wedding dress, a gift from the bridegroom's mother. This, This is the most prized of royal jewels for your lovely neck. I explained to Her Glory that her council of nobles and the Troyius Tribunal jointly agreed that I should instruct make her acquainted with the customs and manners of our people. Captain, I wish to contact my government. I cannot fulfil my mission. It would be an insult to our ruler to bring this incorrigible monster as a bride! There cannot be peace between us. We have deluded ourselves. Captain, when I am near them, I do not want peace. I want to kill them. Job? The job is impossible. We cannot make peace with people we detest. But if she won't listen to me If I recover, it will be no thanks to you, Captain. I should've known better than to talk to her unarmed, but you forced me. I hold you responsible for this. It's not magic. It's biochemical. A man whose flesh is once touched by the tears of a woman of Elas has his heart enslaved forever. There will be no wedding. I would not have our ruler marry that monster if the entire galaxy depended on it, and I will have nothing further to do with you. Here you put me, Captain. Here I will stay. I have nothing further to say to you. Doctor, there is no antidote to the poison of Elasian tears. The men of Elas have tried desperately for centuries to dispel its power. You're wasting your time, Doctor. Safety? What is your estimate of our chances for survival, Doctor? Now that we are all about to die, I ask you once again to accept this necklace, and to wear it as a token of respect for the desperate wishes of your people and mine for peace."

8901,TOS,episode 69,SPOCK,"Governor. Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last visit, making a total of fifteen. Is that correct? A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what I would call an excessive figure. Who is the new inmate? She sounds rational enough, Captain. Very well indeed, thank you, Captain. If you could create a diversion, I might be able to find the control room and open the force field. I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I understand the use of that word. Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan children do in nursery school. Of course, the children are not so well co-ordinated. On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based? Why? How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits? Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion. However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with it. Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet? Captain Garth As you wish. At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place. On the contrary. You were treated with justice, and with compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended victims. Logically, therefore, one must assume She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring permanent male fidelity. Interesting. Thank you, Captain. We're now armed. I presume we shall try to reach the control room. Force field is now off, Captain. Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once. Your safety is vital to the Enterprise. I also request permission to remain here in charge of the security team when they beam down. Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger. Beam him aboard at once. The security team will be entrusted to me. He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain. Give him the countersign, Captain. Queen to queen's level three. 2 Arranging to beam down a security team. Are there any objections? 1 Fascinating. What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tau Ceti? 1 Agreed, Captain. Captains. Gentlemen, whichever one of you is Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy to maintain the image of Captain Kirk. That energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely, and I have time. Captain Kirk, I presume. Spock to Enterprise. Queen to king's level one. I am Mister Spock, science officer on a Starship. Yes, Captain. It was not impossible, Captain. Our presence here is proof of that. The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain. It only seemed long to you. I was waiting for a victor in the hand to hand struggle, which I assumed would be Captain Garth. Because of your depleted condition. Failing a resolution to the struggle, I was forced to use other means to make my determination."

I gave him the sign. Why didn't he give me the countersign? Using the chess problem was the Captain's own suggestion. He couldn't have forgotten it, and I can't believe he was testing me. Lieutenant, re establish communication. Send an armed detail to the transporter room immediately. Mister Sulu, what do your sensors show? We could blast our way through the field, but only at the risk of destroying the Captain, Mister Spock and any other living thing on Elba Two. No breakthrough? Sensor readings? Aye, you're right. Even if they made it, they couldn't carry anything powerful enough to break through the asylum dome. Only the ship herself could do that. Scott here, Captain. You had us worried. They're already in the transporter room, sir. Aye, aye, sir. Waiting for your order, Captain. Still waiting, Captain. Queen to queen's level three. Repeat. Queen to queen's level three. Give the countersign as ordered. Security detail, standby to beam down. Point nine five! Immediate probe. Is the force field in place, Mister Sulu? Doctor, I told you we couldn't do it without killing everyone in the asylum dome. Well, there's one last thing we might try. Perhaps the ship's phasers can cut through a section of the force field at its weakest point. Where did you say that was located, Mister Sulu? Prepare to change orbital path, Mister Sulu. Break synchronous orbit. Come to course one four mark six eight. Ship's phasers to narrow beam. Let's punch a hole in it. Full power. Another blast, full power.  Enterprise here.

8915,TOS,episode 69,KIRK,"Donald, good to see you. We'd be delighted. Why, Donald, are you becoming a pessimist? When I was a cadet at the Academy, his exploits were required reading. He was one of my heroes. I'd like to see him. What is it you want to tell me? You're afraid to talk in front of Governor Cory? Cory? Garth, do you have to make him suffer like that? I'm sorry. I should've said Captain Garth. I'm sorry, Lord Garth. Release him. Are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned? Thank you. Now what have you done with the medicine? Destroyed it? It was your only hope. Of course. The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny. Governor Cory, how do you feel? How does he manage to change form at will? He was such a genius. What a waste. Force field is on. Good. Remain here out of sight until I give the order to join me. Kirk to Enterprise. Beam me aboard. I said beam me aboard. We have no time for chess problems. Beam me aboard! Just testing. Be in touch with you later. No! No! No! Thank you for your concern. All in all, it's been rather restful. I'd forgotten. Where is Mister Spock? How are you, Mister Spock? Isn't Governor Cory joining us? An oversight? In that case, we must decline with thanks. You're very persuasive. Not really. All we need is a few seconds, if Scotty has alerted the security detail. Yes, er, incredible. Oh, er, thank you. That's, er, very magnanimous of you. That's very flattering. I am primarily an explorer now, Captain Garth. And tried to destroy Antos Four. Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue. I agree there was a time when war was necessary, and you were our greatest warrior. I studied your victory at Axanar when I was a cadet. In fact it's still required reading at the Academy. Very well. But my first visit to Axanar was as a new fledged cadet on a peace mission. They were humanitarians and statesmen, and they had a dream. A dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars, a dream that made Mister Spock and me brothers. No thank you. I prefer to join Mister Spock. Occasionally. I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves. I can't for the life of me imagine which one. Dead I am of no use to you. Yes, I think it's very good. I can't. Yes, I recognise it. It's used for rehabilitation purposes. Stop it! No. Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta? I believe you mean that. Marta. Marta, I can help you, but I must get to the Enterprise to do that. Yes, it is. It is if I can get to the control room and remove the force field, then Garth is finished. He will lead you to destruction. He's already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you. But there's more medicine aboard the ship. Spock? How did you manage that? I'm very glad to see you. Yes, you presume correctly. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down here on the double. And have Doctor McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible. Very well, Spock. Scotty, Mister Spock will give the countersign. What have you done with Spock? Where is he? Captain Garth No, sir. Captain Garth, Starship fleet Captain. That's an honourable title. Yes, you were. Yes. But you're a sick man now, sir. No. No, think. Think back to what you were before the accident that sent you to Antos Four. Try. No, I, I can remember. You were the finest student at the Academy, the finest Starship Captain. You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us. And you bore it well. And the disease that changed you, it's not your fault. And the terrible things you did since then, not truly responsible. No, I'm not. I want you to find what you once had. I want you to go back to the greatness that you've lost, Captain Garth. No, sir, listen to me. I No. Coronation? Yes, I agree. You'll wear a crown too, I presume? Garth, you have only a handful of men. No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all. Besides, you seem to need me alive. Listen to me. This may be our last chance. Garth will destroy all of us unless you help me stop him. And he's using you, you know that, because he wants the power for himself. I brought something that might have cured you, but he destroyed it. If I can get a patrol down, they'd bring more of that medicine and All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you. That's Garth, stun him. 2 Hold it, Spock. That's Garth. 1 Look at me carefully, Spock. Can't you tell I'm your Captain? I won't answer that. That's exactly what he wants to know. 1 Very clever, Garth. That's exactly what I was going to say. 2 What are you doing? Yes. They may walk into a trap. 2 That's right. Garth can destroy us. Very good, Spock. The Cochrane deceleration. 2 Spock, you know the Cochrane deceleration's a classic battle maneuver. Every Starship Captain knows that. I'm your Captain, Spock! Can't you tell? Shoot! Shoot! He's right, Spock. You must shoot, but shoot both of us. It's the only way to ensure the safety of the Enterprise. Mister Spock. Captain Garth, I'm James Kirk. The starship Enterprise. Yes, sir, the Enterprise. I'm the captain. Can I help? No, Captain. No. Mister Spock. Tell me something. Why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us? Yes, and congratulations. What took you so long? I see. Mister Spock. Letting yourself be hit on the head, and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head, is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved. Mister Scott, ready to beam up."

9307,TOS,episode 69,CORY,"Gentlemen, you don't know what a treat this is for me. It's been too long since I've had company. The force field's back in place now. That means you two are trapped here, and I'm not accepting any excuses for your not dining with me. It is. The rehabilitation programme isn't progressing too well, and I have my doubts about the effectiveness of this medicine too. I'm afraid I have. Garth. Garth of Izar, a former Starship fleet Captain. Of course. Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment, Marta. She's been saying that for days now. Our medical staff can't figure out why. Here's Garth. He's been unusually disturbed, and we've had to impose additional restraint. Yes, Jim, I'm Cory. It's true. He tricked you. Captain Garth, listen to me. All right. There is no help for any of us if that madman is in command of the Enterprise. He boasts that he's created the most powerful explosive in the universe, and I believe him. The people of Antos taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis to restore the destroyed parts of his body. By himself, he later learned to use the technique to recreate himself into any form he wished. The first time we knew about it was when a guard, seeing what he thought was me in Garth's cell, released him. Don't be a fool, Jim. Go along with him. It helped many men back to health. Will intramuscular injection be satisfactory? How long before it takes effect, Doctor McCoy?"
9308,TOS,episode 69,GARTH,"You said you wanted to see me, Captain. Well, here I am. Your Vulcan friend is still alive, Captain. My phaser was set to stun, not to kill. He'll be quite comfortable. Almost as comfortable as you and our esteemed governor. You will address me by my proper title, Kirk. I am Lord Garth, formerly of Izar, and I lead the future masters of the universe. You Earth people are a stiff necked lot, aren't you? I'm afraid that subjugating you won't be enough. You must be confined. And all the people of the galaxy who will not bow to my will must be confined or destroyed. Oh ho! Our beloved governor has decided to address us, and we have not given him our permission to speak. I'm afraid of no one. You're all powerless against me. The medicine? You mean the poison. I destroyed it. Silence! The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me, and it's time I took command of the Enterprise. You'll help me, of course. My crew mutinied. The first use I will make of the Enterprise is to hunt them down and punish them for that. But they won't. You see, Captain, there's a helpful technique I've mastered. We are going to take the Enterprise, do you hear me? We are going to take her if I have to shatter every bone in Captain Kirk's body. Captain? Captain Kirk? Well, I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable, Captain. Good. Still, I've been quite remiss in my duties as your host. I did invite you down to dinner, as you may recall. But I haven't. You and Mister Spock are to be my guests. Right here. Marta! Stop that, Marta. Mister Spock will think we're lacking in hospitality. Won't you join us, Captain? No, the governor doesn't seem to be on the guest list. An intentional one. The governor's fasting. Captain. Good advice, Governor. Well, Captain? You'll find we set a handsome table, and the entertainment is most enjoyable. Yes, I am. I certainly am. Keep your hands off Kirk! You treacherous thing! I am above that sort of thing. The Captain is annoyed by your attentions, that's all. I may have you beaten to death. You're the only woman on this planet, you stupid cow. You're repulsive! Lies! All lies! You are the greatest liar I have ever met! Let me hear one poem you've written. Gentlemen, courtesy for the performer. You wrote that? It was written by an Earth man named Shakespeare a long time ago! I may kill you with my bare hands! Actually, Captain, she is a superb dancer. Marta, my dear, won't you dance for our guests? That was not a request. Marvellous, isn't she, Captain? What is your reaction, Mister Spock? Nostalgic? She's yours if you wish, Captain. You'll find that I am magnanimous to my friends and merciless to my enemies, and I want you, both of you, to be my friends. Upon the firmest of foundations, Mister Spock. Enlightened self interest. You, Captain, are second only to me as the finest military commander in the galaxy. And so have I been. I have charted more new worlds than any man in history. Well, I could say because they were actively hostile to the Federation. Agreed. Actually they were quite harmless, and they made me whole when I was maimed and dying. And in my gratitude, I offered them the galaxy. They rejected me, and I condemned them to death. That was my only miscalculation. I had changed. I had risen above this decadent weakness which still has you in its command, by the way, Captain. My crew had not. I couldn't sway them, but my new crew, the men in this room, will obey my orders without question. Gentlemen, you have eyes but you cannot see. Galaxies surround us, limitless vistas. And yet the Federation would have us grub away like some ants on some somewhat larger than usual anthill. But I am not an insect. I am master of the universe, and I must claim my domain. As well it should be. Peace mission! Politicians and weaklings! Mister Spock, do you consider Captain Kirk and yourself brothers? Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk is your commanding officer and you are his subordinate. That is all. Yet, Mister Spock, you are a worthy commander in your own right, and in my fleet, you will surely have a Starship to command. Out there waiting for me. They will flock to my cause, and for good reason. Limitless power, limitless wealth, and solar systems ruled by the elite. We, gentlemen, are that elite, and we must take what is rightfully ours from the decadent weaklings that now hold it. Lord Garth! I was betrayed and treated barbarically. Remove this animal! Try some of this wine, Captain. It has a robust, full bodied flavour which you'll find diverting. And I prefer that you remain here. Marta, my dear. We found your little divertissement enchanting, didn't we, Captain? But there's more to come. The entertainment has merely begun. By the way, I assume you play chess. So do I. How would you respond to queen to queen's level three? I'm interested in only one. For the life of me is a phrase well chosen. It could literally come to that. But I can make you long for death, beg for death. Oh, don't beg, Marta! It's degrading. Queen to queen's level three, Captain. You'll talk freely and quite soon. What you see before you, Captain, is my latest invention. Quite ordinary in appearance, almost primitive, wouldn't you say? Appearances can be deceiving. Once it was a part of the rehabilitation process, and as such, quite painless. And I might add useless too. It made men docile and of no use to me. I've added certain refinements to the use of ultrasonic waves. The chair is no longer painless. Put the governor in it. Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk? It is, in fact, exquisitely painful, as you will now see. Interesting, isn't it? The pain is real and can be prolonged indefinitely, because there is no actual destruction of tissue. Of course, Captain. You have but to ask. Now, as you can see, he has not been harmed physically, yet the memory of the exquisite torment remains. Queen to queen's level three, Captain. Too bad. Remove our distinguished governor. Put Captain Kirk in the chair. You really are becoming offensive to me, my dear. Don't make it necessary for me to put you in it. Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk. You want him, don't you? Badly enough to join him? It might be interesting to have you try. Blast away, Captain, if you can. Do you think I'm fool enough to give you a charged phaser? I have done nothing with him as of yet, but I do have plans for him. The Vulcan will die rather horribly, and his death will be on your conscience. Lord Garth! And I was the greatest of them all, wasn't I? I have never been more healthy. I can't remember. It's almost as if I had died and was reborn. Yes, I do remember that. It was a great responsibility, but one I was proud to bear. I don't want to hear any more. You're weak, you're trying to drain my strength. I am Lord Garth! Master of the universe! You doubt me only because I have not as yet had my coronation. Stop! On your knees. On your knees before me! All the others before me have failed. Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan, Krotus! All of them are dust! But I will triumph! I will make the ultimate conquest! The throne must be higher. It must be higher than anything else in this room. Use that table as a pedestal. Ah, welcome back, Captain Kirk. I'm glad you could make it for the coronation. Yes. Oh, I know that even a real throne is no more than merely a chair, but the symbolism is important, don't you agree? But again, just as a token. Not impressive in itself, but it will serve as a standard around which our followers will rally. You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing, don't you, Captain? Perhaps you'd like a larger role in the ceremony. You could serve as human sacrifice, for example. How true. All right, how about crown prince? That would make you our heir apparent. Heir apparent, I believe, is the proper role for you. Besides, we have other candidates for our human sacrifice. Who knows? Ready. Now remove our heir apparent that we may conclude this ceremony. Well done. Well, Captain, you continue to resist. How stupid of you. Put him in that chair right here. I've arranged a small entertainment. I wouldn't want him to miss any of it. Well, Captain, even you must admit that I'm a genius. What you see here is my latest invention. This is an explosive, the most powerful one in history. If I were to drop this flask, the resulting explosion would vaporise this planet. Now do you see why it is ridiculous to resist me? Well, perhaps you require the demonstration I've arranged. Watch closely. Now, it is true that she is deadly as a poisonous serpent, but she is also a beautiful woman, and you have held her in your arms, Captain. I've ordered my men to drive her out of the protective dome. And, of course, she would choke to death on the outside in minutes. But I've arranged a more merciful end for her because after all, Captain, she is my consort. One tiny crystal implanted in her necklace, a portion of this explosive no bigger than a grain of sand. I propose to detonate it from here. Poor girl. Poor, dear, suffering child. I will help her now. Here. How are your nerves, Kirk? You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk. Your stubbornness defies all logic. Logic, that is the key. Your friend Spock is a logical man. A very logical man. Go and bring the Vulcan here to me. Spock is not only a more logical man than you, Captain, but a more intelligent one, I'm sure. I shall establish a rapport with him. Fascinating. Your Vulcan friend is a very ingenious fellow. This could be most amusing. 1 Starship. Starship. No, Captain. The medicine seems to be taking effect. I can manage. It's very encouraging. Should I know you, sir?"
9309,TOS,episode 69,SCOT,"Doctor, they may already be dead. In an orange room, Marta gently gives the waking Kirk a drink of water.)"
9310,TOS,episode 69,MARTA,"Captain! You're making a mistake. There's nothing the matter with me! Can't you see just by looking at me? Can't you tell just by listening? I am rational. I can't tell you in front of him. He isn't really Governor Cory at all, that's just it. Good bye, darling. I'll miss you. Why can't I blow off just one of his ears? You're jealous! Am I annoying you, dearest? He finds me fascinating and you're bothered by it. Admit it. No, you won't, because I am the most beautiful woman on this planet. Well, I'm the most beautiful woman in this galaxy! I'm beautiful! And I'm intelligent too. I write poetry, and I paint marvellous pictures. And I am a wonderful dancer. If you like. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, and summer's lease hath all too soon Yesterday, as a matter of fact. Which does not alter the fact that I wrote it again yesterday! I think it's one of my best poems, don't you? In the midnight of November, when the dead man's fare is nigh, and the danger in the valley, and the anger in the sky. I wrote that this morning. Do you like it? Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away together. But you must. I beg of you. No, you mustn't do that! Please, stop it! Yes. Listen to me, my Lord Garth. I can get him to tell me what you want to know. Slowly, darling, slowly. Rest. I told him I'd discover your secret. I lied. I would have told him anything to save you from that torment. I do. This is where I've longed to be. I think I knew I loved you from the moment I first saw you. That's not possible. Garth is my leader. I'll help you, but you must wait. You do see that, don't you? Soon your friend Spock will be here and then At least I've arranged that much. A convincing lie told to a guard who finds me desirable. Darling. No, you mustn't stop me. He's my lover and I have to kill him."

His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage. The creature may be suffocating. You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural condition of this individual? Negative, Captain. There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive. All gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are genetically predictable. We must therefore conclude that this alien is that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind. Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he were a human. With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research and join you on the bridge. )Spock leaves.) Negative, Captain. There is a vessel out there, Captain. Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew. Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed rather than combat. None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible. There is no sensor failure. The readings persist. It just disintegrated. Fascinating. It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien presence. A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study. Elusive, Captain. I am investigating. Confirmed, Captain. Holding pattern. Co-ordinates now indicate we are charting course to Captain, Cheron lies between four oh three mark seven and mark nine. Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all efforts to direct us to Ariannus. This is Commander Spock, science officer. Destruct sequence number two, code one, one A, two B. Negative, Captain. We are still headed directly for Cheron. Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circular course. Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain. Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids. That description is not scientifically accurate. Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount importance to Starfleet. We do not know that Lokai has done that. The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the same breed as yourself. Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to destroy Cheron. We were once a people like yourselves, wildly emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view, leading, of course, to death and destruction. Only the discipline of logic saved my planet from extinction. Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance, the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured. The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower levels to the more advanced stages. Trouble, Mister Chekov? Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned out. I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers. Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron. Coming within visual range now, Captain. Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems, barren of traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the cities. No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain. There is no evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied corpses in all cities. All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally. None at all, sir. Where can he go? Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing Lokai on deck three. Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching the crewmen's lounge. Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge. Lokai has just arrived on deck five. Passing recreation room three. Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is a life-form materialising on the planet. It is Lokai. He is back on Cheron. It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on Cheron. To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints is not logical. Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate."

His urgent request to be transported to his planet with the man he claims prisoner has been taken under consideration. It is with great regret that we cannot honour that request. Intergalactic treaty clearly specifies that no being can be extradited without due process. In view of the circumstances, we have no doubt that after a hearing at Starbase, Commissioner Bele will be permitted to retain his prisoner and be provided transportation Ready, Mister Scott. Ariannus says go ahead. It just seemed to go dead, sir. Shall I alert security, sir? Captain, someone has activated the transporter mechanism.

Blood is blood, even when it's green like yours. The organs are there. They're rearranged to a degree, plus a few I've never seen before. Now, I've enriched the oxygen content of his blood and pumped in a strong stimulant. And I must say his recuperative powers appear to be excellent. Well, touch and go there for a minute, but you're out of danger now. Well, however we view him, Captain, he's certainly no ordinary specimen. Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you exactly, but if I had your readings, I'd be the most incredible physical specimen of all time. Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve."

It looks like the one reported stolen from Starbase Four two weeks ago. Tractor beams activated. We have it, sir. Aye, sir. Hangar doors open and clearing for entrance of shuttlecraft. Shuttlecraft approaching hangar deck. Bridge to Captain Kirk. Hangar doors closed, and hangar deck is pressurising. Automatic, sir. It's out of control or a suicide mission. Brace yourself for collision. Brace yourself. No, sir. The ship is unresponsive. We're moving away from Ariannus. I can't understand it. I simply have no control. No one knows how he'll react under pressure, Lokai. Yes, but it happened way back in the twentieth century. There's no such primitive thinking today. Ready here. Locked in, sir. Ready here. Controls operating. The Enterprise is responding as always. Captain, it's beautiful. But their planet's dead. Does it matter now which one's right?"
9338,TOS,episode 70,SCOTT,"None, sir. All tanks are being positioned. Scott here. Aye, sir. Hold. Captain, no malfunction indicated. Aye, sir. Out. Engineer to bridge. On auxiliary, sir. I'll be right up. Captain, we are now at warp ten and the speed is increasing! This is Lieutenant Commander Scott, chief engineering officer of the Enterprise. Destruct sequence number three, code one B, two B, three. And at warp ten, we're going now here mighty fast. Warp six and smoothly operating, sir. Disgusting is what I call them. Mister Spock, the word disgusting describes exactly what I feel about those two. We're orbiting Ariannus, sir. At once, sir. Scott out. Ready for decontamination procedure. Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates requested by Ariannus. Mister Chekov, position tanks for spray release. Lieutenant Uhura, advise Ariannus the mission is to begin on signal. All ground precautions must be ready. Well, let 'er rip. Scott to Captain Kirk. First run complete, sir. Aye, sir. Ready to repeat decontamination procedure. Mister Sulu? We're completing the final orbit of Ariannus, sir. I'm awaiting instructions to set course for the next destination. Aye, sir. Re-routed."
9339,TOS,episode 70,KIRK,"Mister Chekov, our estimated time of arrival for Ariannus? Lieutenant Uhura, advise the planet's ministry of health that we'll begin decontamination procedures immediately upon locking into orbit. Scotty, will that present any problems for you? Is it within visual range? Put it on the screen, extreme magnification. Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact them on command frequency two. Try all frequencies. Lieutenant Sulu, activate tractor beams. Prepare to bring it aboard the hangar deck. Lieutenant Uhura, send a security team to the pressure doors on the hangar deck. Mister Spock, come with me. Scotty. Kirk here. Acknowledged. We'll enter as soon as the doors open. Go on my command. Do we have any knowledge of a planet that could have produced such a race of beings? Bones, what do you make of it? And judging by looking at him, we know at the very least he is the result of a very dramatic conflict. Spock? Your prognosis, Doctor? You're aboard the starship Enterprise. Federation. So was the shuttlecraft that you were flying in. Don't you usually know whose property you've stolen? Well, certainly no ordinary thief, considering what it is you appropriated. Well, I do know you made off with a ship that didn't belong to you. You can try those technical evasions on Starfleet Command. That's where you'll be facing your charges. Don't mention it. We're pleased to have caught you. Who are you? Go on. That's in the southernmost part of the galaxy, in an uncharted quarter. What are you doing so far from home? You understand that when we complete our mission, we'll take you to Starbase where you'll face a very serious charge. Had what? What were you going to do? We've never encountered a being like you. I'd like to know more about you and your planet. And very evasive. Or at least not fully responsive. Now, then, Lieutenant Uhura. Notify Starbase Four that we've recovered its shuttlecraft, and it will be returned along with its user as soon as we've completed our mission at Ariannus. Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is applicable, I'll make a note of it in my report. Kirk here. I'll be right there. Notify Mister Spock. Put the ship on the viewing screen, Mister Sulu. Magnification. Still nothing, Mister Chekov. Maximum magnification. I draw a blank, Mister Spock. Your response? What is it? Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device? Weaponry on the vessel, Spock? Something out there can't be seen. Explanation? Invisible. Malfunction? Evasive action. Deflector shields activated, Mister Sulu. Sound warning for collision. Red Alert. Read out, Mister Spock. What is it now? Where? Explain, Spock. One of a kind? Of the planet Cheron, no doubt. Your mode of travel was also unorthodox. Secure from Red Alert. What happened to your vehicle? What brings you to us? All personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command. No one claims anyone without due process. What is your authorisation? From what source? He's in Sickbay. Remember, since you're aboard the Enterprise, you're bound by its regulations. Mister Spock. I told you where you were going. I allowed your fellow countryman here simply as a courtesy. It's now very clear you know each other extremely well, gentlemen. The only service this ship can offer is to bring you together. It is not a battlefield. I'll tell you once more. For you, this ship is a prison. Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation. No treaties have ever been signed. Your demand for possession of this prisoner cannot be honoured. There are no extradition procedures to allow it. Is that clear, Commissioner Bele? How do you mean? I cannot take sides. Impossible. I have a mission to accomplish. There's a planet to be decontaminated. Millions of lives are at stake. Once that has been completed, I'll return to Starbase Four and turn you both over to the authorities. You can make your case to them. Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer you every hospitality aboard this ship. Choose any other course, Yes, I am. I think we can consider your problem settled. At least for the present. I have ordered guest quarters for you on deck six. And I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal chords. It seems you'll have a double opportunity to practise your oratory on Starbase Four. Kirk here. Well, get back on course. I'll be right there. Have you located the malfunction? Explanation, Mister Spock? Kirk to engineering. Scotty, we're suddenly off course. Check our manoeuvering controls. Switch to auxiliary. Kirk here. Stand by for check. Scotty, we're still off course. Speed, Mister Chekov. And new course? Lieutenant Uhura, put the ship on Red Alert. All hands, this is the captain. The ship is on Red Alert. Repeat, the ship is on Red Alert. There has been an unidentified malfunction in the ship's directional control. Repeat, the ship is off course and out of our control. Our new heading, Mister Chekov? Spock? You're two of a kind. Security, put them both in the brig. Phasers on stun. Fire. This ship is going to Ariannus. We are going to Ariannus. The lives of a billion people make no other choice possible. Bele, I am captain of this ship, and it will follow whatever course I set for it, or I will order its destruction. I will destroy it. Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the bridge to the master computer. Computer, destruct sequence. Are you ready to copy? Prepare to verify destruct sequence code one. Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise. Destruct sequence one, code one, one A. Voice and code one, one A verified and correct. Sequence one complete. Mister Spock. Mister Scott. Mister Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by my orders? Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise. Begin thirty second countdown. Code zero, zero, zero, destruct zero. Let's see you prevent the computer from fulfilling my commands. From five to zero, no command in the universe can prevent the computer from fulfilling its destruct orders. You can use your will to drag this ship to Cheron. But I command the computer. Mine is the final command. Computer. This is Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise. Code one, two, three continuity. Abort destruct order. Repeat code one, two, three continuity. Abort destruct order. Mister Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus? We're waiting for you to fulfil your commitment, Commissioner. I make no deals for control of this ship, sir. Ship's course? Speed, Scotty? Good. Lieutenant Uhura, cancel Red Alert. Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen. I could put you in the brig for what you have done, but I won't do it because you are new to this part of the galaxy, which is governed by the United Federation of Planets. We live in peace with full exercise of individual rights. The need to resort to violence and force has long since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship. You are free to move about the ship. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my crew. But let me make it clear. I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship. All hands, return to normal routine. Captain out. We try, sir. That's enough for today. Those two are beginning to affect you. I expect the answer is already on its way. Let's do that. No, Commissioner. The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft. Excuse me. Kirk here. Yes, read it. That's enough. Thank you. Now, wait a minute, Commissioner, I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be twisted, not by Lokai, nor by you. You're black on one side and white on the other. I fail to see the significant difference. Let Lokai state his grievances. Hear him, listen to him. Maybe he can change. Maybe he wants to change his image. There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was true. Excuse me. Kirk here. Very good. Commence decontamination procedures when ready. Advise when complete. Kirk here. Good. Repeat procedure for maximum effect. Kirk here. Very good. We'll be right up. Set directional controls for Starbase Four. Kirk out. Will you join us on the bridge? Can you determine which ones? At the moment, I seem to have no choice. After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much alive. Bele, you keep this up, and you'll never get to Cheron with your prisoner. The rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged. This will be your final battlefield. Your fifty thousand years of pursuit will have been wasted. And you, Lokai, will die here in space. You'll inspire no more disciples. Your cause will be ended. You've made your point. I understand. Will you return the Enterprise to my control? Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed? Check controls and co-ordinates. Is it within visual range? Chekov, put it on the screen. Extreme magnification. What are you picking up? You mean, all the people are dead? Yes, Commissioner, all of them. Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock? Your planet is dead! There's nobody alive on Cheron because of hate. The cause you fought about no longer exists. Give yourselves time to breathe. Give up your hate. You're welcome to live with us. Listen to me. You both must end up dead if you don't stop hating. Bele. The chase is finished. Bele. No, Lieutenant. Where can they run? Spock, anyone in the transporter room? There's nobody there to try him. His judges are all dead. Of course. No, but that's all they have left. Warp factor two, Mister Sulu. Set course for Starbase Four. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

9735,TOS,episode 70,BELE,"Right here, Captain. I am Bele. Forgive my unorthodox arrival. It served me long and durably. Unfortunately, the strain of arduous pursuit has exceeded even its advanced qualities. I was just able to complete this trip and disembark in time, or I would have disintegrated in space with it. Yes. It was sheathed in special materials that rendered it invisible. You bear precious cargo, Lokai. He has taken refuge aboard this ship. I am here to claim him. My apologies, Captain. I overstepped my powers. Claim is undoubtedly an unfortunate word. I am chief officer of the Commission on Political Traitors. Lokai was tried and convicted of treason, but had escaped. May I see him, please? With your permission, Captain. Well, Lokai, it's a pleasure to see you again. This time I'm sure our joining will be of a more permanent nature. Captain, you are to be congratulated. Never before has Lokai been rendered so quiescent. And you see how this killer repays you, as he repays all his benefactors. They were savages, Captain. We took them into our hearts, our homes. We educated them. You were the product of our love! And you repaid us with murder. Slaves? That was changed thousands of years ago. You were freed. Yes, you were free, if you knew how to use your freedom. You were free enough to slaughter and to burn all the things that had been built! There is an order in things. He asked for utopia in a day. It can't be done. You insane, you filthy little plotter of ruin. You vicious subverter of every decent thought. Oh, you're coming back to pay for your crimes! Captain, it is imperative that you return Lokai to Cheron for judgment. Captain, I hope you will be sensible. Co-operation. Since I am without a vessel to return to Cheron, I insist that you take us there immediately. I am sorry, Captain. That will not be satisfactory, not at all satisfactory. You're the captain. We're on the way to Cheron. Captain, this ship is now under my direction. For fifty thousand of your terrestrial years, I have been pursuing Lokai through the galaxy. I have not travelled this far, this long, only to give him up. This ship goes where my will drives it. He cannot help you now. You are lost, Lokai. You're on the way to judgment, to final punishment. You evil mound of filth. Not this time. Oh, the old cry. Pity me, pity me. Everywhere he's gone, he's been helped to escape. On every planet he's found fools who bleed for him and shed tears for the oppressed one. But there is no escape for you on this ship. This is your last sanctuary. And we are both going to Cheron. You cannot change the course of this ship any more than you can change me. This ship goes where I want it to go. Your phasers are ineffective against our shields. You are helpless, Captain. No, this ship is going to Cheron. I will let nothing interfere. You are being obtuse, Captain. I am permitting no choice. My will now controls this, and nothing can break it. You're bluffing. You can no more destroy this ship than I can change colour. I agree! Captain, I am happy to have you complete your mission of mercy to the planet Ariannus. It was madness to interfere with such a worthwhile endeavour. But, if you will, upon completion, please take me and my traitorous captive to Cheron. The ship's course is now in your control. Putting the matter into the hands of your Starfleet Command is, of course, the proper procedure. How long will it be before we hear from them, Captain? Well, then, let us drink to their wise solution to our problem. Gentlemen, we are discussing a question of degree. Surely, stealing a shuttlecraft cannot be equated with the importance of murdering thousands of people. One thing we are agreed on is that Lokai is a criminal. As always, Lokai has managed to gain allies. Even if they don't recognise themselves as being such. Yes, he will evade, delay, and escape again and in the process put thousands of innocent beings at each other's throats, getting them to kill and maim for a cause which they have no stake in, but which he will force them to violently espouse by twisting their minds with his lies, his loathsome accusations and his foul threats. It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an inferior breed. Are you blind, Commander Spock? Well, look at me. Look at me! I am black on the right side. Lokai is white on the right side. All of his people are white on the right side. Commander Spock, I am delighted that Vulcan was saved, but you cannot expect Lokai and people like him to act with self-discipline any more than you can expect a planet to stop orbiting its sun. He cannot change. You mean like both of you? I once heard that on some of your planets people believe they are descended from apes. There is nothing I would like more. Captain's log, stardate 5730.7. Having completed our mission to Ariannus, the Enterprise is now on course to Starbase Four. The crew is on normal routine, and we are proceeding without incident. The directional control and the self-destruct, Captain, are both burnt out. I did it like this. Captain's log, stardate 5730.6. In a deliberate act of sabotage, Commissioner Bele has burned out our destruct mechanism and through the power of his will has again taken over directional control of the Enterprise. Now can we go to Cheron without any more discussion? You're finished, Lokai! We've got your kind penned in on Cheron into little districts, and it's not going to change. You've combed the galaxy and come up with nothing but mono-coloured trash, do-gooders and bleeding hearts. You're dead, you half-white! If you listen to his legalistic trickery, I shall have to destroy this ship and everybody aboard. Why not? My people, all dead? Your band of murderers did this. He must not escape me."
9736,TOS,episode 70,LOKAI,"I've heard of it. It's in the United Fleet of Planets? It was? I am not a thief. You're being very loose with your accusations and drawing conclusions without any facts. I do not make off with things. My need gave me the right to use the ship. Mark the word, sir, the use of it. I'm grateful for your rescue. My name is Lokai. From the planet Cheron. The charge is trifling. I would've returned the ship as soon as I You monotone humans are all alike. First you condemn and then attack. I will answer no more questions. I'm very tired. I insist, I'm extremely tired. Made so by your vindictive cross-examinations. I will answer no more questions. I will not return to Cheron with him, to a land of murdering oppressors! Benefactors? He's a liar. He raided our homes, tore us from our families, herded us together like cattle and then sold us as slaves! Yes, just education enough to serve the master race. Why should a slave show mercy to the enslaver? Freed? Were we free to be men? Free to be husbands and fathers? Free to live our lives in equality and dignity? I tried to break the chains of a hundred million people. My only crime is that I failed. To that I do plead guilty. Not in a day. And not in ten times ten thousand years by your thinking. To you, we are a loathsome breed who will never be ready. Genocide for my people is the plan for your utopia. I know you and all those with whom you're plotting to take power permanently. When I return to Cheron, you will understand what power is. I will have armies of followers. Captain, I led revolutionaries, not criminals. I demand political asylum. This ship is a sanctuary. I will not return to Cheron. Captain, you must guarantee me sanctuary. Stop him. My cause is just. You must help me. All of you must help me. Kill him. Kill him! What a fool I am, expecting help from someone like you. I warned you of his treachery. Kill him! You speak very well, Captain. Your words promise justice for all. Yes, well, I have learned to wait for actions. After Ariannus, what is justice? I shall wait to see it dispensed. And I know from my actions you must all think me a volcanic hothead, erupting lava from my nostrils at danger signals that are only figments of my imagination. But believe me, my friends, there can be no moment when I can have my guard down where such as Bele is present. So what happens? I act the madman out of the anger and frustration he forces upon me, and thereby prove his point that I am a madman. Ah, Mister Chekov, therein lies my lack of ability to alert you and your captain to the real threat of someone like Bele. You see, you are from the planet Earth. There is no persecution on your planet. How can you understand my fear, my apprehension, my degradation, my suffering? You have read about it in history, I see. How can I make your flesh know how it feels to see all those who are like you, and only because they are like you, despised, slaughtered, and even worse, denied the simplest bit of decency that is a living being's right? Do you know what it would be like to be dragged out of your hovel into a war on another planet? A battle that will serve your oppressor and bring death to you and your brothers? So this is justice after Ariannus! You have signed my death warrant. I warned you what to expect. Will you continue to let this mockery of justice go on? If you are partisans of justice, prove it! Kill him! What do you do, carry justice on your tongues? You will beg for it, but you won't fight or die for it. You useless pieces of bland flesh. I'll take you with me, you half-black. Remember, Captain, political sanctuary is my right. I am your prisoner. Honour that right, or the fight will go on and your ship will burn up. No one alive? Your genocidal maniacs did this! You're an idealistic dreamer."

9751,TOS,episode 71,SPOCK,"I shall be interested in hearing your description, Captain. Lieutenant Uhura. Do we have final clearance from Gideon? May I have them, please? Eight seven five. Zero two zero. Zero seven nine. Energising. Put it on the screen. This is Mister Spock, Ambassador Hodin. Captain Kirk was transported down minutes ago. I transported him myself. He was beamed directly to your council chambers. Please verify your co-ordinates. I am not questioning that, sir. I do not deny that, sir. I am not attempting to blame your personnel. Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately balanced as ours, there is still a margin for error which must be dealt with. It is possible that Captain Kirk materialised on some other part of Gideon. Your Excellency. May I cut right to the heart of the matter? I request permission to beam down to conduct a search for our captain. Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems no longer prevail in our galaxy. If you will grant permission We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy is to prolong a crisis. We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor. Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at the moment. The planet is shielded from our sensors, therefore we cannot scan it. Therefore we are unable to select co-ordinates. They must be provided by Gideon. We did not, Mister Chekov. The Federation did. Lieutenant Uhura. Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem. Request permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for Captain Kirk. There are endless, Mister Chekov. Institute a sensor scan three hundred and sixty degrees, one degree at a time. Then the sooner you begin, the better. Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honoured our request with a reply? Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake? What department? Contact them directly. Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they achieve exactly the same results. But that is not what we requested. Your record on the subject is not precise, Your Excellency. Your Excellency, a dispute is the farthest thing from our minds, and there's no need to check your records. I merely suggest that the language of our statement may not have been understood exactly as intended. True, Your Excellency. Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist. Clarity of formulation is essential in my profession also. Yes, Your Excellency. Yes, Your Excellency. I apologise for the noise, your Excellency. To summarise, I request permission to transport down to Gideon. Mister Scott, you'll go to the transporter room and await my orders. Yes, Your Excellency. The ship's engineer was explaining that the malfunction, which did exist, has now been repaired. We would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment. I, therefore, request permission To beam down to your council chamber. Your Excellency, grant this one request. Thank you, Your Excellency. Your proposal is accepted. Mister Scott. Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council. Co-ordinates. Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived safely, and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon. Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed. Mister Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon. SCOTT; Yes, Mister Spock. I'm sending him straight to the same co-ordinates. Do not give up hope. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Command. Demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to beam down to Gideon. Admiral, the crew will not understand it. We wish only to save the life of the captain. I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral. I have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador, that the captain has been taken prisoner. I now know where the captain is being held, if he is being held at the same place to which we transported him. Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council chamber. He is being held nearby. Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot establish that without on the spot investigation. Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary. They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor. Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet. I do not make it lightly, Doctor. However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us. Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon co-ordinates for beam down. Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you? Precisely. I shall beam down at once. Mister Scott, you have the conn. Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive. I can make such a decision only for myself. The situation forces me to do so, Doctor. This will not take long. Captain Kirk. Spock here. Captain Kirk? An exact duplicate of the Enterprise. But completely inoperative. Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise. On the bridge of the Enterprise, Mister Scott. And they were correct. I'm on board an exact duplicate of the Enterprise. In orbit, Doctor. In a manner of speaking, Gideon is in orbit and the ship is on Gideon. I'm sure he's on board somewhere. I'm picking up life readings. Spock out. Ship's log, stardate 5423.8. First Officer Spock reporting. Obviously the Gideon's have transported Captain Kirk onto this replica of the Enterprise to so confuse his mind as to make him susceptible to some extraordinary experiment. It is my intention to locate the captain and warn him before the experiment reaches its conclusion, which logic indicates means the end of the captain's life as he knows it. Your Excellency. Captain, you're looking well. Evidently Starfleet's analysis was correct. Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. Three to beam up, Mister Scott. Negative. Lock in on my communicator signal. Your Excellency, please do not interfere. I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons."

We do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done. Now certainly you understand our feelings about that. Just when I was beginning to think you might find a whole new career as a diplomat, Mister Spock. I don't understand how Starfleet can deny permission to beam down to search for the captain. That's the best possible decision you could make, Spock. I'm with you. Co-ordinates don't match. I'll pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the transporter room. I'm not asking you to make the decision for me. In that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make, Spock. An exact duplicate of the Enterprise? Is it in orbit, Mister Spock? Well, that's a beginning, but what about the captain? Well, that was close, but you made it. Right. Just like the captain."

Mister Spock, the gentleman from Gideon is here. I don't see how they expect us to sit here and wait for the captain to reappear. Eight seven five, zero two zero, seven zero nine. Isn't that just about what Captain Kirk said before he left? Scott here, Mister Spock. You're where? Those were the co-ordinates you insisted on. Scott here. Same co-ordinates?"

Mister Spock? Spock? Engineering? Mister Scott? Scotty! Lieutenant Uhura, report immediately. All bridge personnel, report immediately. Kirk to crew. Is anyone aboard? Sickbay? Doctor McCoy? Bones? Bones, answer me. Bones. Still orbiting Gideon. I am alone on the Enterprise. I have searched every area of the ship and still cannot find a trace of the crew, or an indication of how its disappearance was managed. The one thing that is obvious is that I suffered a memory lapse, during which time I bruised my arm. It is causing me some irritation. Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? Not my personal property, but I'm the captain. It seems, at the moment, we have it all to ourselves. Kirk. I'm sorry. James Kirk. And I didn't bring you here. That's right. Who has brought you here? You? What happened before you came here? Try to remember. It's important. Don't be afraid. I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the Enterprise. Four hundred and thirty, and I, apparently, am the only one left. Maybe you can. Tell me the rest. You were fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out of there. How long have you been aboard the Enterprise? It might be. Come with me. Nine minutes of my life has been lost. Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon and the time I found myself here alone, nine minutes have disappeared just like that. Now what happened during those minutes? That's your home. The planet that you come from. It must be. That's impossible. We were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of Gideon. I tried to beam down, something happened, and you were beamed aboard from Gideon. We're no longer over Gideon. I don't know. I'm not familiar with that quadrant. Odona, you must realise that we're not here by accident. Some force, some intelligence has arranged this for a purpose. Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Captain Kirk here. Red priority. Red priority. It seems to be. Captain Kirk here. Please answer red priority. Please answer red priority. Well, if someone is listening, they're not answering. They wouldn't. Took the ship out of warp speed. Space terminology. We're no longer moving faster than the speed of light. I've trimmed down to sublight speed until we find out where we are. Of course it does. Maybe it is the same. If you believe that, we have. It isn't really, you know. Yes. Yes, it is. Very, very beautiful. How long would you like it to last? Well, let's see. Power, that's no problem, it regenerates. And food. We have enough to feed a crew of four hundred and thirty for five years. So that should last us Most people are afraid of being alone. Why? Why are the people of Gideon like that? It might be Gideon. Yes. It might help me pinpoint our location. I've got to contact whoever is manipulating us. There must be a way. Odona. Odona, can you remember why your people dream of being alone? Why? What makes it so impossible to be alone? Who sent you here? You've come to kill. Odona, have you come to die? Now, all I have to do is find a medical kit, and I can completely cure this. Yes, the irritation would be gone. No. Over something as simple as this? No, it'll cure itself eventually, but. Do you know, uh I don't even remember how this happened. Do you hear that? No, the ship's engines don't make that kind of sound. I know every sound that this ship might make. That's coming from outside. A storm might, but you wouldn't be able to hear it. Come on. This is a viewing port. We'll be able to see outside. If there's a storm, we'll be able to see it. If it works. It was like the heartbeat of all those people, and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship. Yes, I said that. Yes, they can. It could be a mirage. They could exist in our minds. Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet. But why? I think I have an idea. So that we won't keep trying to find out where we are, that we'll be content to stay here. Be content? Be content? Not until I find out what happened to my crew. Are they dead? Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself? I've never felt like this before either. There's no sickness on your planet, remember? Hodin. Let me in there. I can help her. But she's ill. Let me see her. You don't know what she may have. It's very rare, and always fatal if not treated within twenty four hours. I know, it almost killed me. That's how my arm got hurt. You're mad. Your report to the Federation was a tissue of lies. You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions that would make Gideon a paradise. Those are conditions most people would envy. Then why haven't you introduced any of the new techniques to sterilise men and women? Then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent conception. The Federation will provide anything you need. And the great misery which you now face. Yet you can kill a young girl. You're killing your own daughter. How can you do that? The virus you need is very rare. Who will provide it? No sir, not me. You have many methods available. I've mentioned only a few. I do not offer my life for this purpose. I have many plans, and I have hopes other than death for Odona. What was said and what happened between us was for us alone. So that was your plan. That I would fall so under her spell that I would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice. If you don't allow me to bring Doctor McCoy down here, it'll soon be too late to do anything for her. Her death is unnecessary. Even if she lives, her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would. Very short. And it can continue. If only you'll allow me, I can cure you. Mister Spock, we have a patient for Doctor McCoy. Have Scotty beam us up. Why, because you're well again? At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you. Thank you, ma'am. Is that what you want to do? You're needed everywhere, Odona. Oh, yes, it is. It's exactly the same. Only this one works. Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy. With another difference. This one is crowded. It does now. Yes, Odona, I have to. Kirk to transporter control. One to beam down to the planet Gideon."

10163,TOS,episode 71,ODONA,"Odona. Yes, my name is Odona. Why did you bring me here? Is this entire ship yours? And you have it all to yourself? You're hurting me, Captain If you didn't bring me I don't know. It seems I was standing in a, yes. I was standing in a large auditorium crowded with people. Thousands pressed in against me. I could hardly breathe. I was fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out. I'm not, but you are troubled. I'm sorry. I wish I could help. And then I, suddenly I was here on this, on your ship. And there was all this space. And the freedom. I just wanted to float. And then there you were. I don't know. Not long. Is it important? I don't understand. What is Gideon? Is it? Gideon? I don't know any Gideon. I do not think so. Where are we? Captain, before I said I wasn't afraid. Now I am. Isn't it in working order? Then someone should have heard you. Why should they do that? What did you do? Out of what? It feels the same. Well, has the ship slowed down? Oh, please! Don't tell me the sky is out of order now. It's so quiet. So peaceful. And it's beautiful. And we're alone. Can you make it last a long, long time? Forever. Forever. All my life I've dreamed of being alone. Where I come from, people dream of it. Gideon? I told you, I don't know where I come from, what my planet is. Does it matter so much? And then you might find your crew. Being here with you, I forgot there must be others. I envy you your sense of loyalty. I want to ease your feeling of dread, your fear that all your crew no longer exists. Because they never can be. Because there are so many of us. So many. There is no place, no street, no house, no garden, no beach, no mountain that is not filled with people. Each one of us would kill in order to find a place alone to himself. They would willingly die for it, if they could. No one commands Odona. I was not sent here. I don't know. I don't care. I only know I'm here. I only know I'm happy. Cure? What will happen if you do not find one? Will you become sick and die? Yes, it sounds like an engine. But there is something wrong with the equipment. Could that be it? A storm might People. The faces of people. And then the stars. What's happening? What's out there? The sound is gone. But you said we were moving through space. Then the people can't be out there. Please don't frighten me. You mean that we're going mad. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, be content! I don't know. Captain. Captain, something's happening to me. I never felt like this before. Is this the way one looks when one is developing a sickness? Now there will be. There will be sickness. There will be death. Will it last long? How will you know when I am to die? I must see him before then, Father. Yes, in my arms and thighs. It is like, like when you see the people have no hope for happiness, Father. You feel great despair, and your heart is heavy because you know you can do nothing. Pain is like that. I'm glad that you are here. Is the time short? And I asked you to make our journey last forever. Oh. It began here. I'm not afraid of what will happen, but it's just that now I wish with all my heart to stay with you forever. I am cured? Instead of smiling at me, you should be shouting in anger. No. Because I pretended to be How can you bear to look at me after the way I deceived you? You are a gentleman, Captain Kirk. You are no longer needed on Gideon. I can take your place there. That is what I must do. I am needed there now. It is not like our ship. It goes to many other planets? It seems crowded to you? Are you going to stay on the ship? As crowded as my planet is, I could wish for it to hold one more person. I will miss you, Captain James Kirk. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

10164,TOS,episode 71,HODIN,"Captain Kirk, this is Ambassador Hodin. The council is still awaiting your arrival. That's impossible. He never arrived. Eight seven five, zero two zero, zero seven nine. We gave you the exact co-ordinates which should have brought Captain Kirk directly to this very room. If he is not here, that is your own responsibility, Mister Spock, and that of your staff. We are glad to hear that. We shall enter it into the records of this most unfortunate event. Let us hope it was on dry land. Permission denied. Your Federation must be aware Of our jealous tradition of isolation from all contaminating contacts With the violent nature of planets of other star systems. Of course, we shall institute a thorough search. In the meantime, Mister Spock, I suggest that you look to your machinery. Good news. Very good news indeed, Mister Spock. Your captain is definitely not on Gideon. As you requested, we made a most thorough search, and you will be relieved to know that you may now investigate all the other possibilities and forget about Gideon. You requested a most thorough search. It is in the record. And we have used every means at our disposal to accommodate you. Surely, Mister Spock, you do not intend, I hope, to create a dispute between the Federation and Gideon? Mister Spock, you're an officer of a spaceship. In your profession, you use many instruments, tools and weapons to achieve your objectives. However, the only tool diplomacy has is language. It is of the utmost importance that the meaning be crystal clear. I'm glad to hear it. Perhaps you could then make greater effort to choose your words more precisely. Mister Spock! Mister Spock! Are you still there? There was considerable interference with your transmission. A lot of noise drowned out What was said. Would you repeat, please? Forgive me, Mister Spock. No criticism of your equipment was intended. But it has sent your captain on some strange journey, a safe one we all still hope. But it could create for us serious incidents with your Federation, and now you propose to Repeat this disaster with another officer? This would be madness. I could not quite make that out, Mister Spock. Would you be so good as to repeat what you said? But, Mister Spock, you You are a very persistent fellow, Mister Spock. Very well, then, You shall test the skill of your very excitable Repairman. There is one proviso. We cannot risk further incidents. You will therefore transport a member of my staff to your ship. Let us first see if that works. My assistant will provide you with the proper, what is the word? Thank you. Proceed, Krodak. Now, now, not so fast, Mister Spock. That is quite a different matter. We agreed to allow one representative on our soil, your captain. Forgive me, Mister Spock, but I overstepped my authority when I made that agreement. However, your request will be taken up at the next full session of Gideon's council. Yes, Captain Kirk. Our experiment has passed the first stage. We have no need of any of your medicines. And we're grateful to you for her illness. You have done well, my daughter. Guard the captain well. We shall need him for a long time. That depends on the strength of the one infected. You have great strength. Your body temperature will be very great. You will see us, but you will not know who we are. Rest. Now lie still. Do you feel great pain? What is it like to feel pain? Your courage gives me great pride. Not yet. But we do. She has Vegan choriomeningitis. Yes. Our prime minister learned about you during our negotiations. That's why we brought you here. Your blood provided the micro-organisms which infected her. Yes. As Odona told you, we have no need for medical practitioners here. Our apologies. We were unforgivably awkward to have hurt you. No. We are desperate. And so it was! A long, long time ago what we described was true! The atmosphere on Gideon has always been germ-free. And the people flourished in their physical and spiritual perfection. Eventually, even the life span increased. Death became almost unknown to us. It occurred only when the body could no longer regenerate itself, and that happens now only to the very old. But Gideon did not find it enviable. The birth rate continued to rise, and the population grew, until now Gideon is encased in a living mass who can find no rest, no peace, no joy. Every organ renews itself. It would be impossible. But you see, the people of Gideon have always believed that life is sacred. That the love of life is the greatest gift. That is the one unshakable truth of Gideon. And this overwhelming love of life has developed our regenerative capacity and our great longevity. That is bitterly true, Captain. Nevertheless, we cannot deny the truth which shaped our evolution. We are incapable of destroying or interfering with the creation of that which we love so deeply. Life, in every form, from foetus to developed being. It is against our tradition, against our very nature. We simply could not do it. We're trying to re-adjust the life cycle of an entire civilisation. My daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of Gideon. But it was impossible. No stranger could realize the horror that life can be here. I will not beg for your understanding of my personal grief, nor will I parade it for you to gain your co-operation. My love for my daughter is too deep for display. My pride in her runs even deeper. My daughter freely chose to do what she is doing, as the people of Gideon are free to choose. You will stay. Your blood will provide it. My daughter pleaded with you to stay. She hoped you would love her and wish to stay. Stay with us. We're desperate. You see, you cannot leave us now. Go to her. We have told you, it is her wish and mine that there be no interference with the natural progress of the virus. No, her death at so young an age will let the people know for certain that our lifecycle can be changed. It's the symbol that'll bring forth the dedicated young volunteers. The serum in their new blood will change Gideon, and it will once more be the paradise it was."

10180,TOS,episode 72,SPOCK,"I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain. I merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets. Undoubtedly. The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years. It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period. But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth. It would be impossible, Captain. An atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time. Evidently. But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon. Precisely, Captain. Lieutenant Rahda, report to the bridge immediately. Yes. I believe no permanent damage was done. The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the chair. That we have yet to ascertain. Report on the death of the transporter officer. Give me a full report as soon as possible, please. Spock out. Mister Scott, have the transporter checked for possible malfunction. The stars. Wrong? A positional change. Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years to be exact, Lieutenant. Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation. It is also illogical to assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova, could have hurled us a distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven light years. That is correct, Mister Scott, by all the laws that we know. There was no period of unconsciousness. Our ship's chronometers registered a matter of only a few seconds. Therefore, we were displaced through space in some manner which I am unable to fathom. Please, Mister Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic. I have said nothing. I was merely speculating. Spock here. Explain. Would any known disease organism do that? Please keep me fully advised. Spock out. He was in the transporter room. Someone may have entered after Captain Kirk and his party left. Mister Scott, since the Enterprise is obviously functional, I suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed. In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once. Can you give me warp eight? That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but also undignified. Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course. Good. Then prepare to come to warp eight. Eleven point three three seven hours, Lieutenant. I wish you would be more precise. Spock here. Feels, Mister Scott? That is obvious, Mister Scott. I suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct. Spock out. Spock here. Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott? Security alert, all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous. Security alert. All decks. KIRK; Conclusions. Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed the autopsy on Watkins, Doctor? Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer? My guess, Doctor, would be valueless. I suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts. Spock out. The power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture and a very great danger. A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott. If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain and the others are in very great danger. Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security. Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include security search, results negative. Presumably the same way she got on. Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling. We are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and factually ascertain whether or not they still live. Very well. Reduce speed to warp seven. Bridge to Engineering. Negative effect on power reduction. Speed is still increasing. I would calculate fourteen point eight seven minutes, Mister Scott. Sabotage. You said it was fused. How? Worries, Mister Scott? Interesting. No, but the method is fascinating. A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody. As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber. Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point. A magnetic probe. I shall try. Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us. Very well, Mister Scott. You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong. I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it. I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers, comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition. We have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds. I suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway, while I make the computer study. Mister Scott, I suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions. You now have ten minutes and nineteen seconds in which to perform your task. You now have ten minutes and ten seconds. I'm aware of these facts. Please get on with the job. Computer. Analysis on my comparison co-ordinates. Lieutenant Uhura, you are monitoring the magnetic force? Please do not take your eyes off of it. Lieutenant Rahda, arm the pod jettison system. Not until my order. Mister Scott, what is your situation? You have eight minutes, forty one seconds. Computer read-out. Continue. Understood. Spock here. Mister Scott, ease off. Computer, for outphase condition, will reverse field achieve closure? Mister Scott Reverse polarity on your magnetic probe. That is correct, Mister Scott. Please commence. I'll explain. You were correct in your feel. The Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled slightly out of phase. Reverse polarity should seal the incision. Please continue, Mister Scott. Please continue. Mister Scott, you have accomplished your task. For what purpose, Mister Scott? What is it in you humans That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a situation such as this? Two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated, and yet you Feel that something else is necessary. I had the same misgivings about you. We returned and picked up your life form readings only a moment ago. From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise. Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy. What a remarkable culture this is. I surmised that, Captain. Its moves were immensely logical. But what people created this? Are there any representatives here? That is a loss, Captain. To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available. Losira's. Beauty is transitory, Doctor. However, she was evidently highly intelligent. Indeed, Captain?"

If the Enterprise has been destroyed, you know how long we can survive. Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air? Sulu's picked up an organism that's almost a virus, like a a plant parasite. It's the nearest biological form of life I can find. McCoy to Kirk. Jim, I just got a life form reading of tremendous intensity. Suddenly it was just there. Just that. All levels were normal, then I get this biological surge of life form registering. No, now it's gone.  Yes. Zero eight three. I'll be right there. Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted. Jim, what are you doing? Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point. This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered over by top soil. Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for D'Amato. I wonder what killed him. It would be worse if he had company. I'm not joking. Until we know what killed him, none of us are safe. But our instruments recorded that. They were life forms. They registered as life forms. Captain, it doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing about this planet makes sense. Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet? While it lasts. Well, all I know is she almost made a ghost out of Sulu. His shoulder, where she touched it, every cell's been disrupted. Exploded from within. If she'd really gotten a good grip on him, Jim. There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick. A normal wound would heal quickly. Jim, what kind of power must she have? Yes. Why didn't she kill you? He's in fair shape. Keep behind us, Jim. Captain, I'm getting no life form register. That would give a mechanical reading. I'm getting nothing. She's not registering. Is the power level still holding, Jim? You think we're being invited in? We've been led here. Why? Watch out! 2 The women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us. The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people. The supply ship that she was waiting for never came. All these thousands of years, she's been waiting to greet people who were dead. And beautiful."

If the matter - antimatter engines Once in Siberia there was a meteor so great that it flattened whole forests and was felt as far away as Aye, sir. Yes, Captain. All vegetation is inedible. Poison to us. Aye, sir. Sulu to Captain. Captain, I was making a standard magnetic sweep. From zero, I suddenly got a reading that was off the scale. Then, a reverse of polarity and now I get nothing. I've never seen anything like this reading. Like a door opened and then closed again. Poor D'Amato. What a terrible way to die. That's the same red rock. Yes, sir. It looks so lonely there. Doctor, how can you joke about it? You remember on Janus Six, the silicon creatures Beings intelligent enough to have destroyed the Enterprise? The basic substance of this planet is an alloy of diburnium-osmium. It couldn't have evolved naturally. But Captain, where are the people who made it? Why can't we see them? I'll take the first watch, sir. Aye, sir. Who are you? How do you know this? Where did you get this information? Are you from this planet? Then the planet is hollow. Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato? All right. The captain will want to talk to you. That way. Move! What do you want? You were on the Enterprise. Keep back! Stop or I'll shoot! I don't want to have to kill a woman. Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk! Don't let her touch you, Captain! That's how D'Amato died. Phasers won't stop her. How can such people be, Captain? Such evil and she's so, so beautiful. She just touched me. How could it happen so fast? Captain, I'm happy the way it turned out. I feel fine, Captain. But Captain, how does she know about us? Does she read our minds? Phaser on overload! Captain, I'm getting that strange magnetic sweep again, from zero to off the scale. She must be somewhere. I'd rather be on the Enterprise, sir. It's a very painful affair. I can tell you. 3 Captain, we can no longer protect each other."
10193,TOS,episode 72,SCOTT,"Engineering, no damage. All power levels normal. Aye, sir. But that's not possible. Nothing can do that. The point is, it shouldn't have hurled us anywhere. Why, it should have destroyed us immediately, vaporised us. What you're saying is that the planet didn't blow up, and the captain and the others, they're still alive! Aye, sir. But even at that it'll take a while to get there. Aye, sir. And maybe a wee bit more. I'll sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them. Scott to Bridge. Scott to Bridge. Mister Spock, the ship feels wrong. I know it doesn't make sense. Instrumentation reads correct, but the feel is wrong. It's something I can't quite put into words. Watkins, check the bypass valve on the matter/antimatter reaction chamber. Make sure it's not overheating. I didn't ask you to check the board, lad. Oh, you poor lad. Scott to bridge. Scott to bridge. My assistant, Watkins, is dead. I didn't see it happen, but his last words were a warning cry about some strange woman. You mean that one of the people who threw us a thousand light years away from that planet is on board and killing our people? Then you're right, Mister Spock. Watkins must've been murdered. I sent him in to check the matter-antimatter reactor. There are no exposed circuits there. It couldn't have been anything he touched. Bridge to Engineering. Scotty here. I see it. It's a power surge. I'm working on it. Reduce speed until I locate the trouble. Aye, Mister Spock, and I found out why. The emergency bypass control of the matter-antimatter integrator is fused. It's completely useless. The engines are running wild. There's no way to get at them. We should reach maximum overload in about fifteen minutes. Those few seconds will not make any difference, Mister Spock, because you and I and the rest of the crew will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth. This thing is going to blow up And there's nothing in the universe can stop it. It's useless. And there's no question it's deliberate. Aye, and a thorough job. The system's foolproof. Whoever murdered Watkins sabotaged this. That's what worries me. Well, it's fused, all right, but it would take all the power of our main phaser banks to do it. I find nothing interesting in the fact that we're about to blow up. Whatever did this is still aboard this ship. I fail to understand why you cancelled the security alert. Aye. There's a service crawlway, but it's not meant to be used while the integrator operates. What with? Bare hands? Any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion. And I'm not even sure a man can live in the crawlway in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter. You'll be killed, man! Aye. You're right. What have we got to lose? But I'll do it, Mister Spock. I know every millimetre of that system. I'll do whatever has to be done. Aye. It was an emotional statement. I don't expect you to understand it. Mister Spock, we don't have time for that. All right, lads. Get the crawlway door open. Hand me the tools. Communicator. All right. Head first. I hope Mister Spock knows what he's doing. I've sealed off the aft end of the service crawlway, and I've positioned explosive separator charges to blast me clear of the ship if I rupture the magnetic bottle. I'm so close to the flow now it feels like ants crawling all over my body. I heard that. The ship's not structured to take that speed for any length of time. All right, Mister Spock. I'm starting to open the access panel now. Access to the flow itself. If the magnetic flow jumps, you must jettison me. The safety control Will not hold more than two seconds if I rupture the field. I've removed the access plate, and I've got static electric charges dancing on the instruments. Looks like an aurora borealis in there. It's hard to see. There's so much disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow would rupture the magnetic field. I know what time it is. I don't need a blooming' cuckoo clock. Mister Spock. I'm going to try to cut through the magnetic flow. But if the probe doesn't precisely match the magnetic flow, there'll be an explosion. Starting right now. Reverse polarity? That'll take some doing. What purpose could it I have no time for theory. I just hope you're right. I'm doing the best I can! Wait! It's stuck! It's stuck! Push the button! Don't be a fool! Push the button! It's your last chance! Don't be sentimental, push it. I'm going to die anyway. It's loose! But there's no time. Push the button! You might at least say thank you. Never mind."
10194,TOS,episode 72,KIRK,"A ghost planet? Let's take the facts one by one. That should explain something. Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon. That would be difficult to explain. And yet it has. But a fascinating one, Mister Spock. It would bear closer investigation, it would seem, if we're to provide Starfleet with an accurate report. Lieutenant, send Doctor McCoy to the transporter room for survey party. We'll also need Senior Geologist D'Amato. Feed beam down co-ordinates to the transporter room. Mister Sulu, you'll accompany me. Mister Spock, you have the conn. This expedition should be a geologist's dream, Mister D'Amato. Yes. If Mister Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle the Fifth Interstellar Geophysical Conference. A planet that even Spock can't explain. Prepare to transport. Energise. That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt. I don't know. Any more like that and they'll tear this planet apart. Could seismic stress have accounted for it? That's very strange. And that woman. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. The shock may have damaged it. For one thing it means we're stranded. Shall we stop guessing, Mister Sulu, and try and establish a pattern? I get no readings of high energy concentration. If the Enterprise had blown up, it would have left a high residual radiation. Mister Sulu, if I'd wanted a Russian history lesson, I'd have brought along Mister Chekov. This is a matter of survival, gentlemen. Without the Enterprise, we need food, and we need water, and we need them fast. I want a detailed analysis made of this planet, and I want it now. Mister Sulu. Your report covers all vegetation? Yes. I don't see any water, but there must be some to grow the vegetation. A source of water would stretch our survival. Did you see any evidence of rainfall? But there is earth-type vegetation. Yes, that's possible. There's also the possibility of underground water. This apparently is going to be our home for as long as we last. I suggest we find out as much as we can about it. Split up. D'Amato, see if you can find underground water. Sulu, run an atmospheric analysis. Bones, see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite. How do they get their moisture? If you can discover how they survive, maybe we can. Kirk here. Kirk out. Kirk here. What do you mean just there? As though a door opened and closed. What direction? Hang on. D'Amato's section. Come in. Kirk to D'Amato. Come in. Come in. Bones, Sulu, D'Amato doesn't answer. Bones! Digging a grave. There are no good ways, Sulu. My phaser didn't cut through it. Eight thousand degrees centigrade. It looks like igneous rock, but infinitely denser. Mister Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is. I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what you can find out. Yeah. It might be the most suitable memorial at that. I don't know, but something or someone did. We've got to figure this out and devise a defence against it. Is it possible that the rocks have life? Unless we're dealing with beings, intelligent beings who can shield themselves. That's the problem, Sulu. We have only questions. No answers. Except for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments, this planet has no magnetic field. The apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years. No known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time. The planet might be hollow. They might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes. It's dark. Let's get some rest. Tomorrow we have to find some food and some water or it's going to be a very unpleasant stay. All right. Take D'Amato's tricorder. Set it for automatic distress. You never can tell. Hold it! Who are you? How can you destroy others and not me? Who are you? Why are you trying to kill us? Are there men on this planet? No! Bones, did you see that? Maybe Spock was wrong. Perhaps this is a ghost planet. Yes, I know. That's a good question. She touched the transporter chief. He collapsed immediately. She apparently got to D'Amato. We saw what happened to him. The question is, why are you alive? The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure. Sulu's alive because I intervened. But that raises an even worse question. She's not through yet. Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move about? Is he, Bones? All right. Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time. If I'm correct, when she re-appears, the other two might protect the one she's after by interposing their bodies. No weapons seem to affect her. Controls are fused. Drop! Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us. Come on, let's go. Yes. Like a door opening. Who have you come for this time? Why do you want to kill us? Then why do you want to kill me? We're here on a peaceful mission. It's you who have killed our people. We mean no harm to you. We want to leave, peacefully. An android? Who are you? Commander of what? Station? Station? Where? How do you feel about killing me? Stay between us. You want to kill me? Then why do it if you don't want to? By whom? Are there others on this planet? How long have you been alone? Are you lonely? And there's this power surge, right off the scale. Like a door closing. It must be near here. Right off the scale. It's remained at a peak ever since she disappeared. The entrance is here. It certainly looks like it. And the invitation doesn't exactly relax me. I agree. I don't know. But whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there. And without the Enterprise, gentlemen, the only source of food and water is in there. Let's go. Who have you come for? Form a circle. You see? You'd better tell us. Tell us. Who have you come for? Who have you come for? You're a very determined woman. For me? Gentlemen, I need your help. We've seen the results of your touch. That is how you kill. You'll never reach me. That computer must be programming these replicas. Shift positions. Spock, the computer! Destroy it! Mister Spock, I certainly am glad to see you. I thought you and the Enterprise had been destroyed. Returned from where? Was, Mister Spock. Its defences were run by computer. There were replicas of one of them. But that power to recreate them has been destroyed. Well, you wouldn't have thought so, Mister Spock, if you'd been among us. The computer was too perfect. It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing. That bought us the time we needed to destroy it. She must have been a remarkable woman. Kirk to Enterprise. Five to beam up. I don't agree with you, Mister Spock. Beauty survives. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

10595,TOS,episode 72,D'AMATO,"The opportunity to explore so young a planet is an incredible bit of luck, Captain. Captain. Captain! Captain, this tremor we felt, if that's what it was, it's certainly like no seismic disturbance I've ever felt before. I got a reading of almost immeasurable power, but it's not there any more. The reading I got had nothing to do with a seismic force. He's right, Captain. There's nothing there. Yes, sir. No, sir. And I haven't seen any evidence that there ever has been any rainfall. Yes, sir. Could be. Yes, sir. I'm not. Geological disturbances don't frighten me. I've come here to study them. My specialty. That's right. How did you know that? Yes, and we're stranded here. You been talking to my friends? I'm not afraid. You're, you're the woman on the Enterprise. Lucky D'Amato. I want to have a conference about sharing your food and water."
10596,TOS,episode 72,LOSIRA,"Wait! You must not go! Do not be afraid. I know. You are Lieutenant D'Amato, Senior Geologist. From the spaceship Enterprise. Do not be afraid. I am for you, Lieutenant D'Amato. I am only for D'Amato. Do not call the others. Please. My name is not important. Yours is Watkins, John B. Engineer Grade four. Show me this unit. I wish to learn. Not correct. That is the emergency overload bypass, which engages almost instantaneously. A wise precaution, considering it takes the antimatter longer to explode once the magnetic flow fails. I am for you, Mister Watkins. I am unarmed. That is not important. You are Lieutenant Sulu. You were born on the planet Earth. You're helmsman for the Enterprise. I am from here. You do not understand. I have come for you. I want to touch you. I am for him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu. I am for Lieutenant Sulu. Please, I must touch him. I don't want to destroy. I don't want to. Only Sulu. I mean you no harm. Please, I must touch him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu. For you, James T. Kirk. Commander of the Enterprise. For defence. You are Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the Enterprise. You are an invader. I am Losira, Commander. Of this station. Feel? Killing is wrong. You must not penetrate this station. Please, I must touch you. No. I am sent. We defend this place. They are no more. I am for James T. Kirk. Please. I must touch you. I beg it. It is my existence. But you are my match, James Kirk. I must touch you. Then I will live as one, even to the structure of your cells, the arrangement of chromosomes. I am for McCoy. I am for Sulu. My fellow Kalandans, welcome. A disease has destroyed us. Beware of it. After your long journey, I'm sorry to give you only a recorded welcome, but we who have guarded the outpost for you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet. I am the last of our advanced force left alive. Too late the physicians discovered the cause of this sickness that kills us. In creating this planet, we have accidentally produced a deadly organism. I have awaited the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance, but I doubt now whether it will arrive in time. I will set the outpost controls on automatic. The computer will selectively defend against all life forms but our own. My fellow Kalandans, I, Losira, wish you well."
10597,TOS,episode 72,RAHDA,"Mister Spock. The planet's gone! No debris of any kind, sir. I've made two full scans. If the planet had broken up, there'd be some sign. But what bothers me is the stars, Mister Spock. Yes, sir. They're wrong. Yes, Mister Spock. Look. Now here's a replay of the star pattern just before the explosion. It doesn't make any sense. But somehow I'd say that in a flash we've been knocked one thousand light years away from where we were. Already plotted and laid in, sir. We're holding warp eight point four, sir. If we can maintain it, our estimated time of arrival is eleven and one half solar hours. Mister Spock, speed is increased to warp eight point eight. Aye, sir. Warp seven. Mister Spock, our speed has increased to warp eight point nine and still climbing. Mister Spock, we're at warp eleven point two and accelerating. Aye, sir. I'll jettison the pod at the first sign of trouble. Yes, sir. Warp eleven point nine. Fifty seven seconds to go. Warp thirteen point two, sir. Twenty seconds, Mister Spock. Nine seconds. Eight seconds, seven seconds Six seconds, five seconds, four seconds, three seconds, two seconds. One. Mister Spock, now. Warp fourteen point one. Warp fourteen. Warp thirteen point nine and dropping."
10598,TOS,episode 72,WATKINS,"But, Mister Scott, the board shows correct. Yes, sir. Who are you? You know all about me. I've never seen you before. This is the matter-antimatter integrator control. That's the cut off switch. Mister Scott, there's a strange woman who knows the entire plan of the Enterprise."

It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a phenomenon of nature. Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were inoperative. None, Captain. Captain, it was not a storm. Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure. Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain. It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no protective shields. None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special protection was deemed unnecessary. It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the computer complex. Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha, Captain. None. A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable. A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain. Negative. The attack was thorough. Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims. No known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon. I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were. Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself. Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy. Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital. Impossible to determine without programming for computer analysis. I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective defence. Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which is most compatible. Perhaps it did not understand. It appears so. Not directly. Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient data for that. Captain, there is only one possible defence. If we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form. I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible. Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers. And you are sure that this is the correct slide? Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units. As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns, tape D and tape H. Fascinating. Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their thoughts are becoming hers. At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, Captain. She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned. Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still retains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using her voice. That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed. They will not accept their own deaths. Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out their threat. The weightless state has become their natural condition. We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor. Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor. Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure. You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However Logical."

10621,TOS,episode 73,MCCOY,"Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance? Well, I think she's coming around now. You let me be the judge of that. Do you feel like walking to Sickbay? Are the readings corresponding, Nurse? Thank you. Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this ship. You're the only one that passed out, and I want to know why. This whole thing is a new experience for all of us. Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that determination. Now then, tell me. What did you feel before you passed out? Nothing? Lieutenant Lieutenant, you're being completely unco-operative! I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them. Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in Starfleet requires discipline and co-operation. McCoy here, Jim. I think she's in good shape. Somehow, I find transporting into the darkness unnerving. Over here, Captain! Not a thing, Jim. The same garbled sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm. Absolutely sure. She's dead. Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural systems, dissolution of autonomic nervous system. All basic personality factors, Captain. Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown. Yes, Captain. I can be more detailed when we return to the ship and use the ship's computers. We found one person in there just barely alive. The rest were dead, and we Yes, Captain. I can have her ready in a few minutes. Go easy on her, Jim. She's in a pretty bad state. Of course you didn't. I told the Captain. Romaine, Mira. Lieutenant. Place of birth, Martian Colony Number Three. Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased. Jacques Romaine, chief engineer, Starfleet, retired. Yes, Captain. Occasional and teenage routine incidents. None. No, Captain, not empathic. However, an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked. After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a standard Steinman analysis. The results might be interesting. The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors remain exactly the same as before. However, according to two hyperencephalograms, her brain wave pattern has been altered. That's what I was taught. But the is just as consistent as fingerprints. That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That might be a factor. Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine. Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be no error. There has been no error. She could kill us all in this state. The girl’s life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians. She's losing. Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might kill the girl too. The Zetars are growing stronger. The pressure is dangerously high, Captain. It may damage her. We've done it, Jim. They're gone. Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock. Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant. Try not to move at all. Take deep, regular breaths. Now, don't hold it. Continue to breathe deeply. In, out. In, out. That's it. Now, you'll be in there another twenty minutes, so why don't you just try to relax? When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous. However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I find that encouraging. There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock. It was a factor, and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery. Well, I should think work would be a better therapy."

Mira! Mira! Mira! What's that you're saying'? Well, after the disturbance was over, she just collapsed. How's she doing, Doctor? Easy, now. Easy. You had quite a fall. Aye, they are. Now you just do what Doctor McCoy ordered. Captain, would it be all right if I went along to Sickbay? But Captain She might have something there, Doctor McCoy. This is her first deep space trip, and you know that affects people. Come on now, Mira. We must help the doctor. Tell us what happened. I'm sure that's what the lieutenant wants. She just didn't understand. Did you now, lass? Oh, you will not! That's ridiculous. This getting used to space travel, that takes some doing. And not everybody takes to it. Well, me, that's different. I was practically born to it. You will. You passed your Starfleet preliminary examinations. And this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs. Scott here. In the Sickbay. Och, no. I was just checking on the lass. She's going to be fine now. There's nothing wrong with her. I'm afraid this light'll have to do, Captain. The generator is inoperative. Captain! Mira! The captain has some questions. Wait, Captain. We've lost Mira. Stabilise her! Let me. Listen to me. I've told you what strange tricks a space trip can play on your mind. Now, that's all it is. Have you ever had visions of the future events before this? Well, if you ask me, nobody ever has. That seeing to the future, it's pure bunk. You know that, don't you?  And you were perfectly right. Space. Space, that's all it is. Well, if you want to spend the rest of the trip in Sickbay. But what good would that do? Doctor McCoy can no more cure it than he can a cold. What? Mira. Mira. Mira! Mira. Captain! Captain, the phaser shots, they're killing Mira! Aye. When you fired the phasers, they stunned her and she crumpled. Another shot and you'll kill her! Mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things in advance. You don't report space sickness. That's all I thought it was. The first attack on the ship, the attack on Memory Alpha and the time we nearly lost her. And? And? I thought for a moment there was something else, but I guess I was wrong. We've lost her to them. Stay with us, Mira. Please stay. You won't let them. Mira. Mira! Captain. Mira will not kill me. I told you she wouldn't kill me. It's all right, Mira. They're gone. They're gone! Now we have all the time in the world. Scott here, sir. Beautiful, Captain. Positively, Captain."
10627,TOS,episode 73,KIRK,"When a man of Scotty's years falls in love, the loneliness of his life is suddenly revealed to him. His whole heart once throbbed only to the ship's engines. He could talk only to the ship. Now he can see nothing but the woman. Mister Scott. Mister Scott? As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha, you and Lieutenant Romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor. You’ll prepare for direct transfer of equipment. Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the Federation? Yes. Good luck, Lieutenant. Is that Memory Alpha? Magnification eight. What is that? Readings? Check that. No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light. Deflectors on. Condition yellow. Mister Sulu, get us the devil out of here! Full scan on the disturbance that penetrated the Bridge. Lieutenant, all decks, damage report. Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. Emergency. Emergency. I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty? Get to Sickbay, Lieutenant. That's an order. No, Mister Scott. Stay at your post for the moment. Lieutenant Uhura. Damage report. Mister Spock? Any damage to the warp engines? Good. From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we can get. Mister Spock, explanation. Or attack. And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible. Main screen projection. Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that phenomena. Give me an for its possible impact. No shields? Wonderful. I hope the storm is aware of that rationale. Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov? Lieutenant, try and warn them of Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha? Lock into orbit. Any life readings? Let's find out what's going on down there. Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott, report. Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott. Where the devil is he? Scotty, report to the Bridge. Report to the Bridge. Have the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down. Scotty, where've you been? Where are you? Are you sick? Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis, Mister Scott. Is the doctor there with you, or will I find him in Engineering? Doctor, how's the girl? Well, Mister Scott seems to agree with you. The two of you meet me in the transporter room on the double. Captain's log, supplemental, stardate 5725.6. The storm has cleared Memory Alpha. It is heading away at incredible speed. We have been unable to make contact with the planetoid. Its silence is ominous. We are beaming down to investigate. Scotty, can you get us some more light? Damage report, Spock. Locate him and keep him alive. We need more information about this enemy. Bones, can you do something? Are you sure? Kirk to Enterprise. Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately. Spock, have you seen anything like that before? Bones? What did she die of? What did the others die of? A different centre of the brain, you say? Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking. I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me. They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician. Lieutenant. Lieutenant. Why? Tell me why. How do you know? Kirk here. What's its course? Beam us up. Mister Sulu, this is the captain. Get the Enterprise out of here. Delay that order, Mister Sulu! All right, Mister Sulu, get us out of here. Mister Scott, check emergency manual monitor for transporter control. Plot the new course, Mister Chekov. Plot it. Present course will bring it across our starboard side, sir. Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm. Explain. What is it? Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted. Activate shields. Mister Chekov, change course to one four three mark three. Storm's course, Mister Sulu? Take evasive action. Hard starboard, two one seven mark five. Hard port, one one seven mark two. Is it closing? Your analysis, Spock. What is it? Who are they? Where are they from? It's clear we can't outrun them. Can we shield against them? There must be some defence we can use. Maybe we can avoid another attack. Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels. Tie in the universal translator. Mister Spock says it's alive. Maybe I can talk to it. This is Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise. We wish you no harm. Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms. Please, do not come any closer to our ship. Perhaps it understands another kind of language. Condition Red Alert. Prepare for phaser firing. Lock in phaser tracking controls. Locked in, sir. Adjust phasers to fire across its course. Do not hit it. Fire. Reaction, Mister Sulu? Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing. Prepare to lock phasers into the heart of the community. Fire. Lock in for another blast. Killing Lieutenant Romaine? Get her to Sickbay at once. Cancel that order. Another attack on that alien life form will kill Lieutenant Romaine. If she is to survive, we can't attack. Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been accumulating? And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects. Captain Kirk to Doctor McCoy. Is the girl well enough to be questioned? Have the Lieutenant and Mister Scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible. Bring all available biographical material with you. Kirk out. Mister Spock, come with me. I'll try. Lieutenant Romaine. We must get to understand what is happening. Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new crewman. Don't let us upset you. This investigation has been prompted by two events. First is the time you passed out on the Bridge, and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured you. Now this is how we'll proceed. Mister Spock has all the information available to us about our attackers. Doctor McCoy has access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you. A comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and ourselves. All right, gentlemen? Doctor McCoy, will you proceed? Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the attackers? Thank you. Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends? Continue evasive manoeuvres. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Doctor, do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available? I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked. Any history of psychosomatic illness? Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities? Any pathological or unusual empathic responses? Go ahead, Doctor. Go ahead. That's impossible! Let's see it. Check it, Spock. Continue evasive action. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Why didn't you report it? What did she see? Those were all acts carried out by our attacker. Yes, Scotty? What else? Was he wrong, Lieutenant? What did you see? Where? What was he doing? Kirk here. What success did you have? Warp eight, Mister Sulu. They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha. You are especially susceptible to their will. But we have one chance to survive. Don't resist. Let them begin to function through you. If we can control that moment, we have a chance. Will you try? Captain Kirk to medical lab. Prepare the antigrav test units. Let's go. As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports. Stay where you are. Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on. That's not Mira talking. I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. Do you understand? Who are you? You can't be from Zetar. All life was destroyed there long ago. Then what are you? All things die. The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead. She will not. She is fighting for her own identity. Will she learn the way people on Memory Alpha learned? But you did kill! The price of your survival is too high. You can't have her. You're entitled to your own life, but not another's. They'll be forced to accept it. We must get her into the pressure chamber. Secure the chamber. Neutralise gravity. Pressurise the unit. Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second. Continue increasing pressure. Pressure, Spock. Pressure. Continue, Spock. Pressure! Bones, are you able to judge the long range effects on Lieutenant Romaine? Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor? Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not return to Starbase for further treatment? Captain Kirk to Mister Scott. Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine? Yes, Mister Scott. Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty? Thank you. Kirk to Bridge. Mister Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha. Lieutenant Romaine has a lot of work to do there. Well, this is an Enterprise first. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement.

11033,TOS,episode 73,ZETAR,"She cannot stop us. You cannot prevent it. Yes, we understand you. We have searched for a millennium for one through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives. We are from Zetar. Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed. The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last hundred of Zetar. The force of our life could not be wiped out. At the proper time. Our planet was dying. We were determined to live on. At the peak of our plans to go, a sudden final disaster struck us down. But the force of our lives survived. At last we have found someone through whom we can live it out. She will accept ours. Her mind will accept our thoughts. Our lives will be fulfilled. We did not wish to kill. No. Resisting us killed those people. We did not kill them. We only want the girl. Do not fight us. You will all die."
11034,TOS,episode 73,MIRA,"Anything else? We're ready, sir. Thank you. I'm, I'm fine. I'm fine, Doctor. Really, I am. Is everybody else all right? Why? I feel Yes, sir. What's that you're doing, Nurse? But why? I haven't had a single response worth noting. Well, have l? I want to know why too. You're the doctor, you tell me. This is a new experience for me. All of you are accustomed to new experiences. It's part of your work. I'm not. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you. Are you putting that into my record? It's not true. When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I. Did you? I want to continue. I hope that's all it is. Yes, Captain. What did I say? What did it sound like? What technician? We must get back to the ship! That storm, it's returning. I know. You'll be killed if we stay. I tell you t will kill us. I saw those men dead, in their exact positions! No, Scotty. Never. I've always believed it. Then what is it, Scotty? What's frightening me? Ever since that storm hit, I've, I've had such strange thoughts, such feelings of terror. Then I don't have to report it? Help, Scotty! Hold me. It's happening again. No! No, Scotty. No! No. Scotty! I didn't mean to be unco-operative, Doctor. I'll tell you everything I know. I trust all of you implicitly. I want to help. You mustn't worry about hurting me. Yes, there was one other time. I saw Scotty. I don't know. He was dying. Now I understand what's been happening. I've been seeing through another mind. I've been flooded with thoughts not my own that control me. Oh, Scotty, Scotty! I'd rather die than hurt you. I'd rather die. SCOTT@ All right, now. What's all this talk of dying? They've called the turn on us three out of four times. Now, that's a better average than anybody deserves. It's our turn now. We'll fight them. So let's not hear anything more about dying. Tell me what to do. Don't touch me, Scotty! Stay away. I'm trying. I want to be with you. They are too strong. I am Mira Romaine. I will be who I choose to be. I will. Stay away, Scotty! They are with me. They will kill you. Life was given to me. It is mine. I want to live it out. I will"

11049,TOS,episode 74,SPOCK,"Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity, apparently human. Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was uninhabited. Did you say your planet, sir? Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you refrain from a most useless experiment. Are you a student of history, sir? Then you live here alone. It would seem logical to do so for the moment. This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century, and even a sten from Marcus Two. Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy. If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion. Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinci’s, they would be priceless. Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin. Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of mine. Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless. Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms. Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms, and yet unknown. Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate my phaser. Fascinating. Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn, Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do not appear to be confined to art and science. Strongly indicated. It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it. We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order of six thousand years. I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical computer when we return to the ship. We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all. The delay may be deliberate. Most interesting. Our host appears to wish us to linger, yet he is apprehensive. It is logical to assume that we are being monitored and that he is aware of our every move. Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the ryetalyn. Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to depart. The captain wanted us to wait here. Picking up tricorder readings, Captain. Apparently the ryetalyn is behind this door. Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn. There may be dangers within. Let me go alone, Captain. Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint, they appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano, a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings. And da Vinci? How many other names shall we call you? You were born? Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history. You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal as yourself. Your mate for all time. I had hoped I was wrong. We have discovered what he is, Captain. We can remain silent. What will you feel for him after we are gone? Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the circumstances. No, you're not, for she is not. Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger. She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor, even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not bear to hurt either of you. The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her. The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered. Your report, Doctor. On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know? Indeed. Goodnight, Doctor. Forget. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

11057,TOS,episode 74,MCCOY,"Jim, there's a large deposit bearing two seven three, four kilometres away. I've got four hours to process that stuff, otherwise the epidemic will be irreversible. Everybody on board the Enterprise will Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one day. The effects are like bubonic plague. Yes, a Shakespeare first folio. A Gutenberg Bible. The Creation lithographs by Taranullus of Centauri Seven. That's one of the rarest book collections in the galaxy, spanning centuries. Do we trust him? Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin. Saurian brandy, one hundred years old. Jim? Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human vice. Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once alcohol hits that green blood I'll drink to that. What emotion? Well, that could explain the paintings. Similar to the real thing. Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin. I would like to supervise that, of course. With most impressive results, sir. What else interests you besides gravity phenomena, Rayna? The totality of the universe? All knowledge? At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage, but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen. The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege. Thank you, sir. Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand. Thank you. Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in under the wire. I’ve never seen anything like the speed of that robot. It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff. Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium? Like a hawk. I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing, and the next thing I knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn. Well, I think we'd better tell Jim. Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here. Why? Get to the point, Spock, if there is one. The ryetalyn. Physically human but not human. These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim. She's an android. Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal. You learned that you were immortal and You have been such men. You've known and created such beauty. You've watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism throughout your enormous life, and yet now you would do this to us? All emotions are in play, Mister Flint. You harm us, she hates you. Jim. Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last. Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally correlated Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition. And who knows what he might come up with. Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can. Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle. You wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock? You see, I feel sorrier for you than I do for him because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to. The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the desperate chances, the glorious failures, the glorious victories. All of these things you'll never know simply because the word love isn't written into your book. Goodnight, Spock. I do wish he could forget her."

11063,TOS,episode 74,KIRK,"Report. Let's get that ryetalyn. Inoperative. I'm Captain James Kirk Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mister? Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there. We can't possibly reach another planet in time. You can't refuse us the ryetalyn. We're in need! We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it. But you have the ryetalyn that we need! If necessary, we'll take it. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our co-ordinates. Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn. We need only a few hours. With all due gratitude. A most impressive home, Mister Flint. If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting, right over Mister Flint if necessary. Please. Would be? You mean you think they're fakes? Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover, a setup, or even an illusion. Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder reading of our host. See if he's human. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott? Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on this planet, Holberg Nine One Seven G. Stand by with your results. I'll contact. Kirk out. Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real. Easy. Bones? Beam up to the ship and start processing. Thank you, Mister Flint. I don't think we have the time. I thought you lived alone. Rayna. Why not all three? Did you teach her that? You said something about savagery, Mister Flint. When was the last time you visited Earth? Thank you. Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn. Indeed, your greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence. Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him to what you call savagery. The private hells, the inner needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct. As human beings, that is the way it is. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness from within and from without. May I have the pleasure? Is something wrong? Time factor, Bones? Epidemic? But would we have made the error? Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures. Later, Spock. I think I will go to the laboratory. There may be a way of reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin. Stay here. Let me know when Flint and McCoy return. Captain's log, stardate 5843.75. Have I committed a grave error in accepting Flint's word that he would deliver the antidote to us? The precious time I have let pass may result in disaster for the Enterprise and her crew. You left us. The room became lonely. What? What's in there? Then why are you here? Are you troubled now? By what? Are you happy here with Flint? Then why are you afraid? Don't be afraid. Thank you, Mister Spock. If it were around right now, it would correct In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power. I don't like the way he orders her around. He loves her? Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together. The billiard game. He suggested we dance. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott. Report on the Rigelian fever. Just a little while longer, Scotty. Report on the computer search. Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec. Status, legal ward after the death of her parents. Kirk out, Mister Scott. Can you confirm that, Mister Spock? Time factor. What's keeping the processing this time? As though he's keeping us here for some reason. Kirk here. No award of custody? Kirk out. Like Flint. People without a past. What hold does he have over her? Let's find McCoy. I'll meet you in the lab. I don't want to say goodbye. Come with me. I offer you happiness. Childhood must end. You love me, not Flint. Why is Flint playing tricks on us? Apparently we're supposed to go in and get it, if we can. Well, let's not disappoint the chess master. Phasers on full. Why you? Let's find out. We'll all go. Spock, you knew?  Let's go. Why? Kirk to Enterprise. Clear out of the area. Inform Starfleet Command. Enterprise? Scotty? My crew. You'd wipe out four hundred lives? Why? Worse than dead! Restore them. Restore my ship! What needs? Give me back my ship. Your secret is safe with us. That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn. You realised what was happening. You kept us together, Rayna and me, because you knew I could bring her emotions alive. And now you’re just going to take over. Impossible? Impossible. From the beginning, you used me. I can't love her, but I do love her. And she loves me. Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman. She's human. Down to the last blood cell, she's human. Down to the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, she’s human. The human spirit is free. You have no power of ownership. She's free to do as she wishes. I don't want to beat you. This is no test of power. Rayna belongs to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills, to do as she wills, to think as she wills. Rayna, come with me. What happened? Spock. A very old and lonely man. And a young and lonely man. We put on a pretty poor show, didn't we? If only I could forget."

11471,TOS,episode 74,RAYNA,"At last I have seen other humans. One is not human. Oh, so that is a Vulcan. I would like to discuss sub-dimensional physics with him. You've taught me all you know in the area and you say Vulcans know more. Let me meet them. Soon they will be gone. Let me meet them. What is loneliness? Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me. It's so exciting. I'm sorry. Mister Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field density and its relationship to gravity phenomena. Captain Kirk. Everything. Less than that is betrayal of the intellect. Flint is my teacher. You are the only other men I've ever seen. May I show you, Captain? It is a thirst, a flower dying in the desert. I do not know. Flint told me never to enter. He denies me nothing else. I do not know. I come here when I am troubled, when I would search myself. Yes. He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy. Stop command. Stop. I'm glad he did not die. You sent the robot to kill him. My mind could not have summoned it. I was not frightened. Never. You will let them have the ryetalyn? Captain? I've come to say goodbye. I've known security here. No. You must not do this to them. I cannot be the cause of this. I will not be the cause of this. Please stop. Stop! I choose where I want to go. what I want to do. I choose. I choose. No. Do not order me. No one can order me! I was not human. Now I love. I love."
11472,TOS,episode 74,FLINT,"Do not kill. I know who you are. I have monitored your ship since it entered this system. Flint. You will leave my planet. My retreat from the unpleasantness of life on Earth, and the company of people. You're trespassing, Captain. You have nothing I want. If you do not leave voluntarily, I have the power to force you to leave or kill you where you stand. An interesting test of power. Your enormous forces against mine. Who would win? Constantinople, summer 1334. It marched through the streets, the sewers. It left the city by ox cart, by sea, to kill half of Europe. The rats, rustling and squealing in the night as they, too, died. The rats. I am. The Enterprise, a plague ship. You have two hours, at the end of which time you will leave. M4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need. Permit me to offer you more comfortable surroundings. Come in, gentlemen. Our ship's sensors did not reveal your presence here, Mister Flint. My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression of lifelessness. A protection against the curious, the uninvited. Except for M4, which serves as butler, housekeeper, gardener and guardian. Be comfortable, gentlemen. Help yourselves to brandy. Other men. The Vulcan. Even he is not your intellectual equal, nor mine. They are selfish, brutal, a part of the human community which I rejected and from which I've shielded you. Rayna. Have you been lonely? It is thirst. It is a flower dying in the desert. Exciting? You have never made a demand of me before. Do not be sorry. It might be interesting. That will not be necessary, Captain. M4 can prepare the ryetalyn for inoculation more quickly in my laboratory than you could aboard your ship. And when you are satisfied as to procedures, I hope you will do me the honour of being my guests at dinner. I regret my earlier inhospitality. Let me make amends. Gentlemen, may I present Rayna. I meant there are no others besides my family. Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock. Captain Kirk. Her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ. Before dying, they placed their infant, Rayna Kapec, in my custody. I have raised and educated her. Rayna possesses the equivalent of seventeen university degrees in the sciences and arts. She is aware that the intellect is not all. But its cultivation must come first or the individual makes errors, wastes time in unprofitable pursuits. If you would accompany my robot to the laboratory, Doctor, you can rest assured that the ryetalyn is being processed. Your pleasure, gentlemen. Chess, billiards, conversation? We play often. You would tell me that it is no longer cruel. But it is, Captain. Look at your starship, bristling with weapons. Its mission to colonise, exploit, destroy, if necessary, to advance Federation causes. The result of pressures which are not your concern. Why don't you play the waltz, Mister Spock? To be human is also to seek pleasure, to laugh, to dance. Rayna is a most accomplished dancer. Most unfortunate that it was not detected. I shall go with M4 to gather more ryetalyn and screen it myself. You're welcome to join me, Doctor. M4 was programmed to defend this household and its members. No doubt I should have altered its instructions to allow for unauthorised but predictable actions on your part. It thought you were attacking Rayna. A misinterpretation. Too useful a device to be without, really. I created another. It will now go to the laboratory and join Doctor McCoy. Be thankful that you did not attack me, Captain. I might have accepted battle, and I have twice your physical strength. How childish he is, Rayna. Would you call him brave or a fool? Of course! Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing. Doctor McCoy's in the laboratory with the new ryetalyn. He's satisfied as to its quality. May I suggest that you wait here patiently, safely. You have seen that my defence systems operate automatically and not always in accordance with my wishes. Come, Rayna. Rayna! Come. It came to protect you. It was defective, then. I would have destroyed it myself. Have I lied to you? Believe what I say. I would not want Captain Kirk dead. What did you feel? Yes. Go to them, if you wish. Say your farewells. A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk, to end your usefulness. Created here by my hand. Here, the centuries of loneliness were to end. I am Brahms. Yes. Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus, Methuselah, Merlin, Abramson. A hundred other names you do not know. In that region of earth later called Mesopotamia, in the year 3834 BC, as the millennia are reckoned. I was Akharin, a soldier, a bully and a fool. I fell in battle, pierced to the heart and did not die. And to conceal it. To live some portion of a life, to pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected. Galileo, Socrates, Moses. I have married a hundred times, Captain. Selected, loved, cherished. Caressed a smoothness, inhaled a brief fragrance. Then age, death, the taste of dust. Do you understand? Designed by my heart. I could not love her more. You cannot love an android, Captain. I love her. She is my handiwork, my property. She is what I desire. She will never know. You will stay. If you leave, the curious would follow, the foolish, the meddlers, the officials, the seekers. My privacy was my own. Its invasion be on your head. The disaster of intervention, Spock. I've known it. I will not risk it. They cannot answer, Captain. The test of power. You had no chance. It is time for you to join your crew. I have seen a hundred billion fall. I know death better than any man. I have tossed enemies into his grasp. And I know mercy. Your crew is not dead, but suspended. In time. A thousand, two thousand years. You will know the future, Captain Kirk. The flowers of my past. I hold the nettles of the present. I am Flint now, with my needs. Tonight I have seen something wondrous, something I've waited for, laboured for. Nothing must endanger it. At last, Rayna's emotions have stirred to life. Now they will turn to me in this solitude which I preserve. Rayna. I must. I shall take what is mine when she comes to me. We are mated, Captain, alike, immortal. You must forget your feelings in this matter, which is quite impossible for you. No! Rayna! No man beats me. That's what I've worked for. Stay. You can't die."

Power approaching critical. They cannot continue. Power beyond critical. Explosion is imminent. Captain, with your permission One. One is the beginning. I am not Herbert. If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we can arrive at a mutual understanding. I would prefer that you state it. What is your destination? Yes, Captain. Yes, Captain. Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies. There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created. It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound revulsion against the planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced atmospheres. They hunger for an Eden where spring comes. Yes, that is true, Captain. It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar. It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought. I shall make an attempt, Captain. Yes, sir. Captain's log, stardate 5832.5. The arrogance of Doctor Sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation aboard the Enterprise. If it continues, I値l be forced to use controls which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled with extreme tolerance. They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal. The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by criminals. If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred from Eden. Then you knew you were a carrier. What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders. Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you know that. Yes, Doctor. Yes, Doctor. Doctor Sevrin is insane. I've not consulted Doctor McCoy, but I have no doubt of it. His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary control? Come in. No. If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes. I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat, I am not receiving. He has the capability, Captain. Negative. Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In it you'll find a report attesting to the fact That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae. You'll also find a report from the same hospital, giving a full psychological profile on him and projecting these actions of his. Adam. You know I reach you. I believe in what you seek. But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants. We are within sensor range of Eden and continuing to approach. No, Captain, it hasn't stopped. It has gone beyond Captain, they're using Captain, go. I. You must destroy the Ultrasonics. The panel. Negative, Captain. However I am picking up the shuttlecraft. It has landed. Except for those aboard the craft, I read no life at all, either humanoid nor animal. The legends were true, Captain. Fantastically beautiful planet. Captain. His name was Adam. Spock to Enterprise. Stand by to beam aboard injured parties. Medical team to the transporter room. Miss Galliulin. It is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden. I have no doubt but that you will find it, or make it yourselves."

I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive planet, but assuming one did exist, I can tell you what would have happened had he settled there. There wouldn't have been enough primitives left to bury their dead. I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim. Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it. Synthococcus novae. It's deadly. We can immunise against it, but haven't learned to lick all the problems yet. All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier. Remember your ancient history? Typhoid Mary? He's immune, as she was, but he carries the disease and spreads it to others. I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before boarding. Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too. But a regular programme of shots is necessary. I'll have to check everyone on the ship. There could be some skips. In the meantime, he should be placed in total isolation. Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you? Then why did you fight the examination? Be ready for the objections, Jim. They are a vocal lot. It'll show in twenty four hours. It's a virulent strain. McCoy here. Yes, Captain. Yes, Jim. It's burned. All this plant life is full of acid. Even the grass, Jim. It should for a while. Poison. The fruit is deadly. He should be beamed aboard, Jim. He needs more than I can do for him here.

In addition to piracy, you've left yourself open to charges of violating flight regulations, entering hostile space and endangering the lives of others as well as your own. In addition you've caused an interstellar incident which may have destroyed everything that's been negotiated between your planet and the Federation. If you have an explanation, I am prepared to hear it. Mister Spock, take them to Sickbay for a medical check. There may have been radiation from the explosion. By all means. That planet it is a myth. Well, whether you recognise authority or not, I am it on this ship. I am under orders to transport you back to Starbase peaceably. From there you'll be ferried to your various planets. Because of my orders, you are not prisoners, but my guests. I expect you to behave as such. Mister Spock, you seem to understand these people. You will deal with them. And after they are finished in Sickbay, see to it that they're escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they need. I have orders to the contrary. This is not a passenger ship. Lieutenant Palmer, notify Starbase we have the six aboard who stole the space cruiser Aurora. Regrettably, the space cruiser itself was destroyed. Personal note to the Catullan ambassador. His son is safe. Yes, what is it? One of those was in the Academy? Do you wish to see her? Permission to leave your post. Are they in the Sickbay? Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists? Doctor Sevrin is their leader? Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides. And they seek the primitive. All do. The cave is deep in our memory. But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children. What makes you so sympathetic toward them? Spock. What does Herbert mean? Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking. What's going on, Bones? Does he have it? What about the others? Is the crew in danger? Put him in isolation. Yes, I'm ready. Kirk to Security. I want a guard maintained on Doctor Sevrin until further notice. Bones, how long before we know whether the crew has been endangered by this infection? Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu, explain. Doctor Sevrin will be released when we think he is medically safe. Yes, Scotty, what is it? Thank you, Scotty. Mister Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people. Do you think you can persuade them to behave? Thank you, Mister Spock. If it weren't for that ambassador's son, they'd all be in the brig. I'll have Bones check him out. Spock, I'm sorry. You had great respect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done. Certainly. Mister Chekov, assist Mister Spock. Bridge to Sickbay. Bones. I'd like to talk to you. Captain's log, stardate 5832.6. I have asked Doctor McCoy to check Starfleet medical records to verify Mister Spock's suspicion that Doctor Sevrin is insane. In spite of Doctor Sevrin's antipathy to us, he has promised Mister Spock that he will order his disciples to conform to our rules and regulations. I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty. Didn't you? Bridge to auxiliary control. Bridge to auxiliary control. Can he do it? Start a trace-back of all circuits. See if you can bypass him. Any patrols? There will be soon. Doctor Sevrin. You are violating Romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy. The Romulans will view this as a military intrusion and attack. Bring the ship about now. If you bring her about And return to Starbase, no charges will be leveled. If you do not, you will never reach Eden. You and this ship will be destroyed. Adam. Rad. You are being led by a man who is insane. You are being used by him. Spock, you tell them. Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now. We have no choice. Mister Spock, Mister Scott. Spock! It's all right, Spock. It stopped. What is it? Kirk to Engineering. Bridge? Hangar deck? Kirk to Transporter Room. Kirk to Bridge. Do you read me? Come in. Never mind. Do we have control of the ship? Can we break out of orbit if we have to? Kirk here. Stand by. Do you read any Romulans? Where? Auxiliary control to Doctor McCoy. Bones, are you all right? Stand by, transporter room. Full medical gear. No. No, they tried to destroy us. Let them think they succeeded. I want the co-ordinates zeroed in so that when we beam down, we won't be visible to them. Scotty, you have the conn. If any Romulans appear, try to make them understand. I do not want to provoke combat. Mister Spock. Mister Chekov, join us in the transporter room. Is this what they believed they'd find? Then I can understand. Spread out. Approach with caution. Doctor Sevrin. What is it? Will our clothing protect us? Bones? There's the shuttlecraft. Here, we'll help you. Doctor Sevrin. Bones! We can help you aboard the ship. Be sensible, Doctor. Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself! Stop! Alert them that we have the four and we're ready to beam them down. And mark the incident closed. Bridge to Transporter. Scotty, are they there? Stand by. Mister Chekov, do you wish to attend? Thank you, Mister Chekov. You did what you had to do. As did we all. Even your friends. You may go. We reach, Mister Spock. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

At least, I think I recognise her voice. Her name is Irina Galliulin. We were in Starfleet Academy together. Yes, sir. She dropped out. She Thank you, sir. Excuse me. Is Irina Galliulin with you? Irina. You knew I was on the Enterprise? Irina, why? Come. How could you do this to yourself? You were a scientist. And now, look at you. Why did you do it? I am proud of what I am. I believe in what I do. Can you say that? Yes. You even talk like them. Why did you go away? I came back to look for you. I looked. Where did you go? You never felt as I did. Never. You don't have it in you to feel so much. Even when we were close, you weren't with me. You were off thinking of something else. Why did you stay away? Go to your friends. Yes. Auxiliary control. Should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage, we can navigate the ship from here. What do you want? It does not matter. Let us not discuss your beliefs. Then why do you do such things? I am assisting Mister Spock in locating your Eden. I am not. These tapes contain star charts, and we project the orbits of the various planets here. By mathematical process, we determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet charted. What I do not know I find out from the computer banks. If, if I knew nothing at all, I could navigate the ship simply by studying what is stored in there. They contain the sum of all human knowledge. They solve our problems of navigation. Of control. Of life support. No. We use our own judgment also. You could never listen to anyone. You always had to be different. I am sorry, Mister Spock. I was momentarily delayed. No, sir. Control is in auxiliary. Bridge to Captain Kirk. Do you wish to open communication, sir? Eden. The flower, sir. I touched it. It's like fire. Captain, I wish first to apologise for my conduct during this time. I did not maintain myself under proper discipline. I endangered the ship and its personnel by my conduct. I respectfully submit myself for disciplinary action. Thank you, sir. I was coming to say goodbye. And you be correct."

Oh, we should not tear at each other so, Pavel. We should meet again in joy. Today when I first knew it was your ship that followed us, I thought of you and wondered what I would find. And I remembered so much. In spite of that uniform, I still see the same Pavel I used to know. Are you happy in what you do? Then I accept what you do. It was you who went. I stayed in the city, with friends. I did. Because you disapproved of me, Just as you do now. Oh, Pavel, you have always been like this. So correct. And inside, the struggle not to be. Give in to yourself. You will be happier. You'll see. Am I allowed in? I have been looking for you, Pavel. What room is this? What's it for? To apologise. I should not have teased you. It was cruel. Oh, but it does. It is against everything I believe in. And I do not like having you angry with me, or disapproving. What are you working on? Oh, now you are teasing me. Do you know all these things? They tell you what to do, and you do what they tell you. I could never obey a computer. Not different. What I wanted to be. There is nothing wrong in doing what you want. Everything can be handled from auxiliary control. The computers contain all the information we need. We can do it. Pavel said they would. Our original course must have been somewhat in error. What will that do to them? What is it? Sound pitched that high doesn't stun, it destroys. I remember when we read in the text that it It was so beautiful. And I was coming to say goodbye to you. Be incorrect, occasionally. Occasionally. Thank you."
11912,TOS,episode 75,SEVRIN,"We are One. If you understand One, you know our purpose. We turn our backs on confusion and seek the beginning. The planet Eden. And we protest against being harassed, pursued, attacked, seized and transported here against our wishes. We do not recognise Federation regulations nor the existence of hostilities. We recognise no authority save that within ourselves. We respectfully request that you take us to Eden. We respectfully request that you take us to Eden. I refuse to accept your findings. They're the product of prejudice, not science. Untrue! Fantasy. Fantasy. This is outrageous. You're not isolating me, you're imprisoning me. You invent a crime, find me guilty and sentence me! No! It was an infringement on my rights. I have no influence over what they do. As I have been barred. Of course I knew. You've researched my life. You've read the orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology because of what my body carries. Because this is poison to me. This stuff you breathe, this stuff you live in, the shields of artificial atmosphere that we have layered about every planet. The programs in those computers that run your ship and your lives for you, they bred what my body carries. That's what your science have done to me. You've infected me. Only the primitives can cleanse me. I cannot purge myself until I am among them. Only their way of living is right. I must go to them. I shall go to them and be One with them. And together we shall build a world such as this galaxy has never seen. A world. A life. A life. So now you're going to try to persuade me that your technologies will find a cure for me, and then I'll be free to go. And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave so that they too will be allowed. All right, you send them in. I'll talk to them. That's right, someone else is running this ship. I am. All functions, life support as well. You cannot interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the control room. I do not intend to hand over the helm to you until and unless we reach Eden. If I am in any way prevented from reaching that destination, I shall destroy this ship and all aboard. Do that, and I shall retaliate. I shall not warn you again. When will we get there? They'll try to persuade us to change course presently and then they'll attack. I have another weapon. Take control, Brother Rad. Making an adjustment on their circuits. At the proper time. Let me know when we're in orbit. Well, I'm using sound against them, beyond the ultrasonic. It will stun them and allow us time to leave. We'll go in one of their shuttlecraft. I've gone beyond those texts, Irina. It's correct for you to be concerned, but be assured also. We cannot allow them to come after us. It will not reach us in here. I can control it all. I have adjusted it so that it will suspend its effects after a few moments and allow us time to escape. Then, after we've gone, it will automatically reactivate. Rejoice, brethren. Soon we shall step together into Eden. Now we may leave. No, we're not leaving. We're not leaving Eden, none of us. We're not leaving."

His hobby is botany. Can. I reach botany. It's my favorite of studies. What's yours? When will it? Can you suggest any special ways to swing them? There it is. They've established Eden, Brother Sevrin. At this speed, three hours. How do you plan to stop them? By cutting off their life support?

But would he shake on a session? I mean, we want to co-operate, like you ask, so I'm asking. I'll spread the word. Can? Vulcan. Spock is practically One now. It starts to chime. Soon.

A city actually floating in the sky. It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy. Have you ever visited here, Captain? I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms are incomparable. It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have been eliminated. Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain. It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery. Greetings, Mister Advisor. The Disrupters? Who are they? Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity elevation I've ever seen. Nor I a work of art, madam. Despoil? For what purpose? Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow. But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone. That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor. This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine seems appropriate for her. I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred. The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her. Your movements awakened me. Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible. The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants. We do pride ourselves on our logic. The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan’s. At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations. Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam. Am I intruding, Captain? In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos. But they are not allowed to share its advantages. The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture. Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its technical translation is cave dweller. Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam? All the little things you and I understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice. But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law. Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported. As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off. Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor. Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak Two. Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if he chooses. Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain. Spock here. We've been trying to make contact, Captain. Is anything wrong? Locked in and ready to beam up consignment. Standing by for instructions. Instructions clear. I shall carry them out immediately. Spock out. That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does express the thought. You will have that opportunity. Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you handle the transporter yourself. This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain. Spock here. You'll have to delay. Picking up two life-forms in the gallery. They are inseparably close to one another. We cannot transport one Without the other. Precisely, Mister Scott. Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait. Unless you have an alternative? Spock to transporter room. Lock in on Council Gallery co-ordinates. Energise. How are you doing, Mister Scott? Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately. Good work, Mister Scott. The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm. Contact check, Captain. It has been over an hour since your last communication. Standing by, Captain. However, let me remind you, we have only five hours left to That is very unlike the captain. Enterprise, Spock here. Captain, the zenite gas has affected you. Captain! The zenite gas! It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function. There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below, and only one way to really experience it. No. No, Vulcan is quite different. Two hours, fifty-nine minutes to be exact, Captain."

Their intellect ratings are almost twenty percent below average. That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines. Therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths. Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here. There are none after it’s refined. But in its raw state, it emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional. Therefore, it releases a violent reaction. That's right. And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to it.  That's right, Spock. The other Disrupters were probably removed from exposure too. According to findings, it should. No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure. There's every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary, even after repeated exposure. But that could take days. It's pretty hard to overcome prejudice. You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders? Can the zenite be affecting him? Look out, Jim!"

On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock? There must be some mistake. Do you have the co-ordinates to the mine entrance available? Kirk to transporter room. Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city, Stratos? Fine. Uhura. Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, and that we're beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite. The need is urgent. Mister Spock, come with me. Oh, and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future. Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it. Once. I didn't have time to look around. Yes, art is the population's chief occupation. There's the mine entrance. The zenite consignment should have been there. I don't understand it. Those Troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down. Perhaps. Who are you? What's the meaning of this attack? We're here by permission of your government council on an emergency mission. No, just a little shaken up. Captain Kirk, Enterprise. My first officer, Mister Spock. It was rather warm. Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment. Why wasn't it in its specified location? They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it. Hostages? For what purpose? Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor. Pleasure, madam. What are their demands? I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak Two. I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the Federation. You again! Yes, duty is a good teacher. I see you've changed your dressmaker. So you can attack me again? That would be foolish. I'm not afraid. In fact, I find this rather enjoyable. All right, I'll make a deal with you. You answer some questions and I'll let you up. Your word first. Spock? Then why this? No, not at all. In fact her visit was quite enlightening. Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the Enterprise is here to intimidate them. We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it. In times of emergency, they do anything. And believe me, this botanical plague is an emergency. Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all humanoids. Surely, you don't deny it to the Troglytes. They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment. Yes, I should have realised. Mister Advisor! You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her. Surely there are better methods than this. Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured! The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to Vanna. But obviously no more consideration. The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us. Of course, but Starfleet command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel, Mister Advisor. Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite. You won't get it through torture. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, we're ready to beam up. Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command that the zenite has not been delivered. In my opinion, Plasus' method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed. If the zenite is not delivered shortly, I shall have to violate Plasus' order of non-interference and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the use of reason. That's impossible, Bones. The Troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause. Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of that. Natural growths? What kind? And the mines are full of that gas. Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna. It seems impossible. They've outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months. Does the brain return to normal? Can you neutralise the gas? Find one. Meet us in the transporter room. This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life, chemical as well as bacterial. We have used these filter masks frequently on Doctor McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly. We've checked his findings through the computer and they're absolutely valid. There's no time to argue about the findings now. I simply propose to tell Vanna all about them. This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes. I would like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenite consignment. Are you afraid the filter masks will work? Is that why you don't want the Troglytes to try them? I am here to get that zenite. If these will help me get them, I'll use them. My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate. Doesn't give us much choice, does it. Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters. If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. This is the only thing that might convince her. If you’re about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer is negative, Spock. That goes for you too, Bones. Officially, yes. But this mission is strictly unofficial. Nobody's to have any part in it, any responsibility for it, but myself. That's an order, Spock. You have the conn. Stand by till I contact you. Vanna, I've brought you a gift. There's a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of the Troglytes exposed to it for a period of time. This mask will prevent any further damage. Yes. That's true. But an idea can't be seen or felt. That's what's kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries, a mistaken idea. Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them. Plasus is not the whole government. As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back. I'll request permission to mediate for the Troglytes. Vanna, you must trust me. I give you my word. The zenite can be delivered in a few hours. You won't have long to wait now. Vanna, you must trust me. If you don't, millions of people will die. A whole planet. This zenite is all that can save them. This filter mask is all that can save the Troglytes. Trust me. Please. We had a bargain. Why did you break it? I trusted you. Then you are a fool. These masks will free you, just as I said. Holding me won't help you. My men'll still come for that zenite consignment. They'll still come. Without that mask, I haven't It takes a while for its effects to be noticed. Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill everyone? The masks can change that. How long do you plan on keeping me here, providing Midro doesn't kill me, of course? That's quite a while. Longer than I expected. Completely. Die from something that can't be seen? You astound me, Vanna. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Nothing. Are you locked in on me? Circumstances dictate a slight variation, Spock. Hold on these co-ordinates. Locate the High Advisor and beam him to these co-ordinates immediately. Without advance communication. Repeat, without advance communication. Have you got that, Spock? I am preparing a demonstration on the effects of unbelieved gas. Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas, Mister Advisor. Perhaps you need closer exposure. Fill that container. I insist. You too, Vanna. You too! Dig! Kirk here. What is it? Your orders are to stand by. Now, carry them out! Kirk out. We'll leave when the gas has effect. Dig! I said dig! One more step and I'll kill you. Both will kill. The zenite gas. Well, it seems my little demonstration was quite a success. They will be very effective. sir. They've been severely tested, and the Troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties. Thank you, Vanna. Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties. The Federation Bureau of Industrialisation may be of aid to you. Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return here. Only answering your charges against me will force me back. You're guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting against his life. Yes, Vanna. They never happened. Mister Advisor? Mister Spock, let's get that zenite delivered. I believe we only have three hours left. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott beam us up. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

12358,TOS,episode 76,SENTINEL,"Apologies, Mister Advisor, but this Troglyte was apprehended leaving the city. He is without a transport card so we thought you would want to question him. The Disrupter Vanna has disappeared. Her guard was found half unconscious. He'd been attacked by Captain Kirk. He did not know, sir. He did not regain his senses until I came to his aid."
12359,TOS,episode 76,ANKA,"You have returned. You are clever, Vanna. Very clever."
12360,TOS,episode 76,DROXINE,"The sentinel told me of our honoured guests, my father. I came to extend greetings. Indeed, yes, Captain. I have never before met a Vulcan, sir. How dreadful!. They're despoiling the whole city. I'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to our planet. Oh, yes, that would have been dreadful. The Disrupters must be mad to attack two such charming strangers. Do you think that Captain Kirk and his very attractive officer will feel that we're responsible for their injuries? Mister Spock, I thought you had accompanied Captain Kirk to the rest chamber. My apologies. I did not realise they would disturb you. It seems that Vulcans are fascinatingly different in many ways. Vulcan eyes are very discerning too. I hear that, intellectually, Vulcans are as highly evolved as Stratos city dwellers. You only take a mate once every seven years? And is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, Mister Spock? Vanna! Why have you come here? Has she injured you, Captain? Oh? Send a sentinel to the rest chamber immediately. You talk like a Disrupter, Vanna. But Stratos is for advisors and studiers. What would Troglytes do here? The caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to light, just as your minds are not accustomed to logic. The Troglytes are workers, Captain. Oh surely, you must be aware of that. They mine zenite for shipment, till the soil. Those things cannot be done here. That is their function in our society. How can they share what they do not understand? The complete separation of toil and leisure has given Ardana this perfectly balanced social system, Captain. Why should we change it? The surface is marred by violence, like the Troglytes. But here in Stratos, we have completely eliminated violence. But what else can they understand, Mister Spock? No, Father. No, really. I'm not upset. I was just standing here looking into space and wondering whether or not he would return. But the zenite is so important to him. He must have it. By that time, it may be too late. Perhaps he does have a method No, I wasn't thinking of Captain Kirk. It's the one with those exquisitely shaped ears. His name is Spock. He's the one I was thinking about. Did you know that he has the most incredibly sensitive hearing? Why, I almost believe that if I stood here and called out to him, he would hear my invitation to come and visit with us for a little while longer. Shall we try? They are desperate. I'm sure Mister Spock would not behave so. Father, are we so sure of our methods that we never question what we do? I don't like filters, or even masks. I like the word protector much better, don't you? Stratos is so pleasant and so beautiful. I think I'm afraid to leave it. I shall go to the mines. I no longer wish to be limited to the clouds. Is your planet like this one? Someday I should like to visit it."
12361,TOS,episode 76,PLASUS,"Troglytes, halt! Surrender or we'll fire! Are you harmed, gentlemen? I'm Plasus, High Advisor of the planet council. My regrets for the unpleasantness of your welcome to Ardana. Unfortunately, violence is habitual with the Troglytes. But I assure you, this insult will not go unpunished. Apparently the Disrupters have confiscated it, as I knew they would. A small group of Troglyte malcontents. All the other Troglytes are completely dominated by them. It's the Disrupters who are responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenite. They agreed obviously as a ruse to get valuable hostages. To force the council to meet their demands. Organise a search party immediately and find the zenite consignment. Meanwhile, Captain, I would suggest that you and First Officer Spock be our guests on Stratos. We'll do everything possible to make it so. Come, gentlemen. A most gracious act. One of our planet's most incomparable works of art. My daughter, Droxine. Captain James Kirk. And First Officer Spock. Come, gentlemen. There is much to see in our city. This is our council gallery. It is open to all city dwellers. We have some of the finest of our various art forms assembled here for the viewing and contemplation of every Disrupters again. By keeping us in constant turmoil, they hope to force the council to accede to their demands. Completely unreasonable, Captain, but nothing you need be concerned with. I assure you, gentlemen, you will get what you came for. Of course, and we accept the responsibility. Art means nothing to the Disrupters. This is the only form they understand. The disturbances accompanying your arrival have been most wearying. No doubt you would like to rest. Chambers have been prepared for you. A sentinel will guide you to them. It's fortunate that they were not seriously hurt. Further violence could create grave difficulties between Ardana and the Federation. They grow more daring and determined every day. Now they seek to find allies in the galaxy. All this time I thought you were worried about our diplomatic relations. Remove his shields. What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte? Speak! I command you! Repair what? Indeed. Then you must have a repair permit. Where is it? Did you also forget your transport card? And where was your cavern implement lost? Could this perhaps be it? And you shall make them by giving us the names of the Disrupters. I would advise you to increase your knowledge. Secure him to the rostrum. How unfortunate. How unfortunate. You still refuse to disclose the names of the other Disrupters. Very well, if you prefer the rays. She's stubborn, and as you yourself pointed out, Captain, the search for your zenite consignment must be short. Physical discomfort is extremely persuasive, Captain. Is it preferable to spare Vanna and allow an entire planet to be destroyed? Troglytes are not like Stratos dwellers, Mister Spock. They're a conglomerate of inferior species. The abstract concepts of an intellectual society are beyond their comprehension. A few Troglytes are brought here as retainers. Vanna was one of them, as are the sentinels. They've received more training than the others. I fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism. An imposing display of primitive gallantry, gentlemen. You realise, of course, that the sentinels could remove you. Why are you so concerned with this Disrupter's well-being? Then stop interfering, and I'll get it for you. We will get it for you, and in our own way. Remove the prisoner to confinement quarters. You will return to your ship at once or I shall contact your Starfleet command myself and report your interference with this planet's government. If Captain Kirk appears again, kill him. Captain's log, star date 5819.0. More than eight hours have passed since the consignment of zenite disappeared and we have still found no trace of it. We've received word from Merak Two that the plague is spreading rapidly. Delivery of the zenite is imperative within twelve hours or all life on the planet will be annihilated. Do you really expect me to believe that that mask can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes? How can a mere filter accomplish what centuries of evolution have failed to do? And do your computers explain how my ancestors, who also dwelt in caverns, evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos while the Troglytes did not? Preposterous. I doubt whether even Vanna will believe such nonsense! I'm sorry, Captain. Such an offer could only cause more unrest among them. I cannot allow it until our scientists have checked the findings. You are here to complete an emergency mission, not conduct tests, Captain. And I forbid it. Your Federation orders do not entitle you to defy local governments. This communication has ended. Something's upsetting you, Droxine. What is it? Tell me. He will never return. I've seen to that. It will be delivered. If we have to kill every Troglyte, it will be delivered. He knows nothing except how to destroy our power and our society. I forbid you ever to speak of Captain Kirk, or even to think of him. Oh, he's no better than his friend. What is it? Where is Captain Kirk? This is the kind of reason they use to persuade us. I will hear no more defence of them. Leave here at once. Go to your music. Abduction of a planet official is a serious crime. You will pay for this, I promise you. What effects? I've been here nearly an hour of your Earth time. You and Vanna even longer. I see no changes in any of us! Are you suggesting that I dig zenite? You will indeed pay for this. She's right. Kirk, transport us out of here. It will never take effect. Transport us out of here! Imbecile! We'll die! I am High Advisor of all the planet. I will take no more orders! Are you as brave with mortae as you are with a phaser? It appears you have what you came for after all. Agreed? There's no such word in the Troglyte vocabulary. No thanks to any agreement by you. It had to be obtained by force. How about your education? Was that by force? You could have had those filters for all the good it will do you. They will all be like her. ungrateful, vindictive. I will tolerate absolutely no interference! You will not set foot here as long as I rule! And I shall press them. You are guilty of abduction, Captain!"
12362,TOS,episode 76,TROGLYTE,My business is to repair. There are damaged entrance panels. It was forgotten. It was lost when your sentinels attacked me. I came to make repairs. I know nothing. That is not possible for a Troglyte. The Stratos city dwellers have said it.
12363,TOS,episode 76,VANNA,"Interference breeds attack, Captain. Come on! Move on, Captain!. You sleep lightly, Captain. Release me. Call the guards if you’re afraid, Captain. I do not! What questions? I will answer. I did not come here to kill you, Captain. To take you hostage. Spock and Droxine enter) Droxine. To welcome our honoured guests as I was taught to do when I served in your father's household. It is not impression, Captain. It is the truth. Starships do not transport cargo. Lies will not keep the Troglytes in the caverns, and neither will your starship. I speak for my people. They have as much right to the clouds as the Stratos dwellers. Live in the sunlight and warmth, as everyone should. There are no Disrupters! Gas from zenite? It's hard to believe something which is neither seen nor felt can do so much harm. Would all the Troglytes wear these masks? Suppose Plasus does not agree? That is true, but the city council will not listen to Troglytes. Centuries ago, Stratos was built by leaders that gave their word that all inhabitants would live there. The Troglytes are still waiting. Hours can be centuries, just as words can be lies. Very well, Captain. I will trust you. The consignment lies deep in the mines in a place known only to Troglytes. I cannot direct you. I must take you there. You asked for my trust, Captain. Are you unwilling to give yours? It's the sentinel with my refreshment. Wait. We'll need a transport pass to leave the city. Midro. Anka. And I've brought with me a hostage. Seize him! Did you really think I would trust you, Captain? I'm not such a fool. You thought you would trick me with your talk of your filter and your unseen gas. I don't believe you any more than Plasus does. Our weapons are our freedom. And you’ve just furnished me with two very valuable ones. Yourself and this. Without your communicator, you will be hard to locate. Perhaps. In the meantime, a taste of our existence, Captain. Dig as the Troglytes do. As the Troglytes do. With your bare hands, Captain. Captain's log, supplemental, stardate 5819.3. First Officer Spock reporting. Captain Kirk beamed down to Stratos to attempt to win the confidence of the rebel Troglytes. Unless he has made his escape from Stratos to the mines, his life is in danger from the High Advisor. The captain has not informed us of his progress. For our part, we must maintain silence. We can be of no help to him without jeopardising his life. You dig well, Captain. The unseen gas doesn't seem to be harming you. Nevertheless, you won't be needing this. Anka, deposit this on the transport platform so Plasus will know we have something more valuable to bargain with than our mortaes and thongs. Searchers will be coming soon, Midro. Go to the other mines and tell the Troglytes to post watchers. I will see that he doesn't escape. A dead hostage is of no value, Midro. I brought him here and I will say what is to be done. Can you do nothing but argue? The searchers will be here soon. Midro is a child. Return to the digging, Captain. Until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds. We're sealed in! But soon the atmosphere will go. We'll die. You would seal Plasus here also? For what purpose? I grow faint. The oxygen is going. The gas! Captain, you were right. It's taking effect! Captain, you were right! Enterprise! Enterprise, help! Enterprise! They'll kill each other. Help us. Help us! Enterprise! Enterprise! The captain will have his zenite, just as I agreed. The captain will have his zenite. Because it is the only way we can obtain what is due us. It served your purpose at the time. Yes. Our demands have just begun. Here is the zenite, Captain, just as I promised. Captain, perhaps both incidents are best forgotten."

Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there. Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some natural phenomena. We're being scanned, Captain. A deep probe, incredibly swift. Fascinating. They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion. Small change occurring there, Captain. An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It measures completely Earth-like. Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like living rock with heavy fore claws. It’s settling down now to completely human readings. Band honours ready, Captain. We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your old-style measurements. It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile. More that direction, Engineer. I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien. It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel. No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this. Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear. President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you. What better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for you. Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work of duplication. Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact, I must beam down with you. Captain. Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us. Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning. Surak. The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain. The father of all we became. It is not logical that you are Surak. There is no fact, extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible. Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold true. As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg forgiveness. It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest. I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack. And if they’re real, Captain? Yes, Captain. Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course. His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain. The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let him attempt it. I deeply respect what he has accomplished. They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect us to act rashly. He was aware of what might happen when he went. You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him. A Vulcan would not cry out so. I am not insensitive to it, Captain. Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for us to attempt a rescue. No, sir. Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation. It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter. Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain. Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be anything but what we expected them to be?"

Well I think Starfleet should forget about those old space legends. There's no intelligent life here. Jim! Jim, do you really believe he's Abraham Lincoln? Human, Jim. Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard? And that became Lincoln? I'm not quite sure. Captain's log, stardate 5906.4. Who or what has been beamed aboard our vessel? An alien who has changed himself into this form? An illusion? I cannot conceive it possible that Abraham Lincoln could have actually been reincarnated. And yet his kindness, his gentle wisdom, his humour, everything about him is so right. Where the devil are they? Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image. Do I have to lay it out for you? Practically the entire crew has seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he can’t possibly be the real article. You're the science officer. Why aren't you, well, doing whatever a science officer does at a time like this? At last! At least somebody agrees with us he's an alien. Mad. Loony as an Arcturian dogbird. Yes, a big one. Suddenly, miraculously, we see a small spot of Earth-type environment down there. Now is it really there, or do we just think we see it down there? Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam down there? But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim. I think it's interesting, in as much as you're the one who's going to make the decision whether to beam down or not. You're both out of your heads! Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able to patch together again? If they’re wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava Scotty. If they’re all right, they should've reported in. At least the captain and Spock are safe. Can we beam the captain and Spock back up? Well, can we send the phasers down? But they're not real, any more than that Lincoln or Surak. What do the sensors read? Could they be aliens projecting an illusion?"
12387,TOS,episode 77,GREEN,"Captain Kirk, may I speak with you? I quite agree with your attitude toward this charade. It's ridiculous to think that we should take part in it. The same thing as you do, to get out of here. I have no quarrel with you any more than you have with me. History tends to exaggerate. I suggest we call a halt to this at once and see if we can't find some way out of our difficulties. My associates are in full agreement with me. Captain, you were tricked into coming here, weren't you? So were we all. I can't remember. Isn't that strange? My memory used to be quite remarkable. Well, wherever it was, I want to get back. So it seems to me, Captain, that we have a common cause, and our enemy is that creature. That we combine forces, and reason some way to overcome it. But that was centuries ago, Captain, and not altogether true. No, there is much I would change now if I could. Don't let prejudice and rumour sway you. Did you set the traps? What did you find out? What are they doing? With what? These? No, it's not advantage enough. I want to make sure the odds are in our favour. Overwhelm and devastate, that's the way to get power and to hold it, and I mean to do that. No. Let's hear what he has to say. We may find it useful. Stop there, Vulcan. State your purpose. Are you surrendering? I'm doing what I consider best for all of us. If you choose to regard that as surrender, I accept your definition. Why are you doing this? Do you speak for the others? How can I be sure? I think you’re trying to trick me, Vulcan. I think that while you're here talking peace, the others are preparing to attack. How can I believe that? No one talks peace unless he's ready to back it up with war. Then tell me, what do you have to gain if we accept? What do I get out of it? I fight for gain, Vulcan. What do I gain here? No. He's our means to finish them all. You're very persuasive, Vulcan. I'd like to come out of this with a whole skin. Perhaps I can convince my associates that it would be to their advantage also. Mister Spock, your friend wants you. He seems to be hurt. You can't let him suffer. They should be coming soon. Zora! Kahless! No, wait! How many do you see? Zora. Now can you cry like Lincoln?"

President Lincoln, indeed. No doubt to be followed by Louis of France and Robert the Bruce. Aye, sir. Locked on to something. Does that appear human to you, Mister Spock? We can beam it aboard anytime now, sir. You heard Mister Spock yourself. Mineral he called it, like living rock. I couldn't tell. It may have been another figure down there standing by. What do you make of it? Why, they're probably looking up a plate of haggis in the galley. They've been everywhere else. Lincoln died three centuries ago on a planet hundreds of light years away. Mad. Loony as an Arcturian dogbird. You might beam down into a sea of molten lava. Don't do it, Captain. Aye, sir. Aye! Transporter room to bridge. Standing by. Then they're dead men. I couldna pull them back in time. Come in, landing party. Report. Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Can you read us? How is it, Mister Sulu? Shut down all but the most necessary systems. Engage restart cycle. Start emergency procedures. It's a confrontation of some sort. Those are all figures out of history. Notoriously evil. We don't have the power. They'll come aboard a mass of dying flesh. There's nothing we can do, Doctor. Nothing but watch them. He's skimmed the worst ones in history to face them. Scott to Engineering. Report, Lieutenant. Give me that again, man. I cannot hear you. Engineering, check for radiation. Get a repair crew on it at once. Is there a danger of detonation? Captain. I cannot. We have a complete power failure. We're on emergency battery power only. I can't explain it, sir, but the matter and antimatter are in red zone proximity. There's no knowing and there's no stopping it either. The shielding is breaking down. I estimate four hours before it goes completely. Four hours before the ship blows up. The ship is functioning normally again, sir, and the restart cycle is in operation. You'd never know anything had been out of order. I can't fathom it."
12392,TOS,episode 77,KIRK,"Spock, any answers? Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there. Lieutenant, anything from the planet? Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the planet. Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and investigate further. We are therefore going on to our next assignment. Prepare to warp us out. Alert status. Uhura I recognise what you appear to be. Spock. I was requesting your analysis, Spock. We'd be honoured to have you aboard, Mister President. We can convert to it, sir. Thank you, Mister Mulney. Magnification four, helm. Security, send a detachment to the transporter room immediately, phaser side arms, and be prepared to give presidential honours. It's obvious he believes it. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock, full dress uniforms. If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mister Scott. Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is actually coming aboard, but we're dealing with an unknown and apparently highly advanced life-form. Until we know, when in Rome, we'll do as the Romans do. Doctor McCoy, take tricorder readings and see if it is human. Appropriate ruffles and flourishes, Mister Spock. Security, stand ready. Energise. The Enterprise is honoured to have you aboard, Mister President. That's taped music, sir. A starship on active duty never carries an honour detachment. An energy-matter scrambler, sir. The molecules in your body are converted into energy, then beamed into this chamber and reconverted back into their original pattern. Mister President, may I present my officers. Commander Spock, second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer Dickerson. Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters. Mister President. Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high. We're six hundred and forty three miles above the surface of this planet. Yes, Lieutenant. May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura. We've each learned to be delighted with what we are. The Vulcans learned that centuries before we did. Certainly. Our engineering officer Oh, dear. If you’ll forgive me, our communications officer Forgive me again. We'll rejoin you shortly. Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen. I doubt that, Bones, but continue. Yes, of course he's an alien. And he's potentially dangerous. Gentlemen, as you know, Mister Spock and I have been invited to beam down to the planet surface with him. Any comments on that? But why would he want to kill only two of us? Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that? But not only to me, Spock. The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life. Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we have been offered contact. Therefore, I shall beam down. Mister Spock, as for you And you're on the edge of insubordination. Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated. Mister Spock, standard dress, tricorders and phasers. We will guide President Lincoln to the transporter room. We'll beam down immediately. Standing by, Mister Scott. All right, Mister Scott, energise. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Your explanation, sir? Why were our weapons taken? Why can't we communicate with our ship? The game is over. We've treated you with courtesy. We've gone along with what and who you think you are. Who? Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer. We know nothing of your world or your customs. What do you mean, drama about to unfold? We perceive we were invited to come here, and we came in friendship. And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel. What do you mean, survival? Mister Spock and I refuse to participate. Analysis, Spock. Why do they want us to fight? And they'll get their answers if it kills us. What do you want? You're somewhat different than the way history paints you, Colonel Green. Where do you come from? What do you propose? You were notorious, Colonel Green, for striking at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them. Anyone hurt? Mister Spock? No, I think Colonel Green is right. That rock-like thing is our enemy, not those illusions. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Scotty, do you read me? What caused the red alert? Scotty, beam us up fast. What happened? What caused that? What if they defeat us? Scotty, inform Starfleet Command. Disengage nacelles, Jettison if possible. Mister Spock, assist them. Advise and analyse. Scotty? Scotty? There's nothing immoral about fighting an illusion, Mister Spock. We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and all the crewmen aboard. We'll use this as a base. It's defensible. They can't approach without being seen. No, we don't have time. But if things go against us, I want a place to retreat to. What I want to do now is scout them out, find their weaknesses and attack. Occasionally. Why? Thank you. Thank you. Mister Spock, we'll need weapons. I believe the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang? And slings and spears. Slings. Mister President. You used a sling as a boy. We don't have much time, Spock. Circumstances were different then, Surak. I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here. My ship is at stake. So are mine, Spock. If I believed that there was a peaceful way out of this You saw how treacherously they acted. I have no authority over you. You may do as you think best. The weapons, gentlemen. In case he fails. Your Surak is a brave man. You show emotion, Spock. I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon. Surak? Yes, I know that. I should never have let him go. How can you ignore that? Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony. But you can just listen to it and do nothing. I can't. I can’t just let him stay there. Do what they want, sir? And what will you do? No. I can't let you risk it, Mister President. Your campaign, Mister President. Mister Lincoln! You established the methods and the goals. What did you offer the others if they won? You offered me the lives of my crew. How many others have you done this to? What gives you the right to hand out life and death? We came in peace. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Yes, Mister Sulu. We're all right. You may beam us aboard. Mister Scott, report. Mister Sulu. Good. Mister Chekov. Thank you, Mister Chekov. Mister Spock, any explanation? Well? They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel I actually met Lincoln. It was so hard for me to see him die again. I feel I understand what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace. There's still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy, Spock. Mister Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next assignment."

12813,TOS,episode 77,LINCOLN,"Captain Kirk, I believe. A pleasure to make your acquaintance, sir. No need to check your voice telegraph device. Do I gather that you recognise me? And appearances can be most deceiving, but not in this case, James Kirk. I am Abraham Lincoln. I have been described in many ways, Mister Spock, but never with that word. Illusion? Captain, will you permit me to come aboard your vessel? No doubt you have devices which can check my reality. Do you still measure time in minutes? Then you should be directly over my position in. There. Exactly twelve and one half minutes. Until then, Captain. Strange. Where are the musicians? Taped music, you say. Well, perhaps Mister Spock will be good enough to explain that to me later. A most interesting way to come aboard, Captain. What was the device used? Well, since I'm obviously here, and quite whole, whatever you mean apparently works very well indeed. Gentlemen, if those are weapons, please lower them. At my age, I'm afraid I'm not very dangerous. All too human, Doctor McCoy. Happy to make your acquaintance. Mister Spock, Mister Scott, Mister Dickerson. Gentlemen, I hope to talk to each of you. But meanwhile, your captain is consumed with questions and I shall do my utmost to answer them. And I trust your duties will permit time to answer some of mine. At your service, Captain. A most interesting vessel. You can measure great distances that closely? Bless me. What a charming negress. Oh, forgive me, my dear. I know in my time some used that term as a description of property. The foolishness of my century had me apologising where no offense was given. Yes. Philosophy of Nome, meaning all. How did I know that? Just as I seem to know that on the planet surface you will meet one of the greatest living Vulcans in all the long history of your planet. My mind cannot recall his name, but I know he will be there. What is it that powers your vessel, Captain? May I see your engine room? I would be delighted to have her as guide. Well, I have none. To me this seems quite as it should be. Please, believe me. I know nothing other than what I have already told you. Despite the seeming contradictions, all is as it appears to be. I am Abraham Lincoln. I'm afraid none of us may leave, gentlemen, until we do what it demands of us. I fear my clothing is somewhat damaged, but how delightful to discover at my age that I can still wrestle. For an illusion, my opponent carried a considerable punch. Oh, I forgot. You consider me an illusion too. James, the war is forced upon us. History repeats itself. Supplemental Log, stardate 5906.5. Engineer Scott reporting. The Enterprise is doomed to explode in two hours if Captain Kirk is defeated by the enemy on the surface of the planet. The enormous power of the Enterprise has been neutralised and we sit here watching, unable to assist. Are we fighting a defensive war, James? Do you drink whiskey? Because you have qualities very much like those of another man I admire greatly. General Grant. Indeed I did. Perhaps we can rescue him, Mister Spock. Now, I suggest that we do whatever they want. Not the way they want it, however. We must first convince them that they have provoked us to recklessness. James, I do not mean to presume upon your authority. What I propose is that I circle around to their rear while you two provide a frontal assault. It should be sufficiently violent to cover whatever I do. Why, slip into their camp and free him. James, James. Remember, I was something of a backwoodsman. I doubt that you could do what I was bred to. I am no longer president. Mister Spock, any comment? One matter further, gentlemen. We fight on their level. With trickery, brutality, finality. We match their evil. I know, James. I was reputed to be a gentle man. But I was commander in chief during the four bloodiest years of my country's history. I gave orders that sent a hundred thousand men to their death at the hands of their brothers. There is no honourable way to kill, no gentle way to destroy. There is nothing good in war except its ending. And you are fighting for the lives of your crew. Surak. Surak, the others have drawn them away. We will circle around. It was a worthy effort, Surak. Worthy. No need to blame yourself before its failure. James, stay back."
12814,TOS,episode 77,DICKERSON,"I understand President Lincoln's coming aboard, sir. All I know is what the captain tells me, and he says he'll have the hide of the first man that so much as smiles. Phaser team, set ready for a heavy stun."
12815,TOS,episode 77,KAHLESS,"Yes. They've done nothing. They've not armed themselves nor prepared for any kind of defence. I say attack now and finish them. Better than what they have. Colonel! One of those peace lovers, Colonel. Why don't we kill him? Two. Help me, Spock. Help me, Spock. Help me, Kirk. Help me, Kirk!"
12816,TOS,episode 77,ROCK,"You'll have an answer soon, Captain. Our world is called Excalbia. Countless who live on that planet are watching. Before this drama unfolds, we give welcome to the ones named Kirk and Spock. You're intelligent life form, but I'm surprised you do not perceive the honour we do you. Have we not created in this place on our planet a stage identical to your own world? Your objection is well taken. We shall communicate with your vessel so your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the play. Behold. Captain, Mister Spock, some of these you may know through history. Genghis Khan, for one. And Colonel Green, who led a genocidal war early in the 21st century on Earth. Zora, who experimented with the body chemistry of subject tribes on Tiburon. Kahless the Unforgettable, the Klingon who set the pattern for his planet's tyrannies. We welcome the vessel Enterprise To our solar system and to our spectacle. We ask you to observe with us The confrontation of the two opposing philosophies you term good and evil. Since this is our first experiment with Earthlings, our theme is a simple one. Survival, life and death. Your philosophies are alien to us, and we wish to understand them and discover which is the stronger. We learn by observing such spectacles. The word is explicit. If you and Spock survive, you return to your vessel. If you do not, your existence is ended. Why do you hesitate? Do you wish further clarification? Your choice of action is unlimited, as is your choice of weapons. Should you wish to use any, you may fabricate anything you desire out of what you can find around you. Captain? You will decide otherwise. I am disappointed. You display no interest in the honour we do you. We offer you an opportunity to become our teachers by demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful. You find my body heat distressing, Captain? You forget the nature of this planet. I must conclude that your species requires a cause to fight for. You may now communicate with your ship. The estimate is quite correct. Your ship will blow itself to bits within four hours, Captain, unless you defeat the others before then. Is that cause enough to fight for? To save your ship and your crew, you have to win. Your communicators no longer function, Captain. You may proceed with the spectacle. You are the survivors. The others have run off. It would seem that evil retreats when forcibly confronted. However, you have failed to demonstrate to me any other difference between your philosophies. Your good and your evil use the same methods, achieve the same results. Do you have an explanation? For you to use as you chose. What they wanted most. Power. I perceive you have won their lives. The same right that brought you here. The need to know new things. And you may go in peace."
12817,TOS,episode 77,SURAK,"Just as I am whom I appear to be. Live long and prosper, Spock. May you also, Captain Kirk. Whatever I am, would it harm you to give response? The image of Surak read in your face what is in your mind, Spock. The cause was more than sufficient. Let us speak no further of it. In my time, we knew not of Earth men. I am pleased to see that we have differences. May we together become greater than the sum of both of us. The captain speaks wisely. Those four are not our enemy. We should arrive together at a peaceful settlement. In my time on Vulcan, we also faced these same alternatives. We'd suffered devastating wars which nearly destroyed our planet. Another was about to begin. We were torn. But out of our suffering some of us found the discipline to act. We sent emissaries to our opponents to propose peace. The first were killed, but others followed. Ultimately we achieved peace, which has lasted since then. The face of war has never changed, Captain. Surely it is more logical to heal than kill. That is precisely why we should not fight. I will not harm others, Captain. The risk will be mine alone. If I fail, you lose nothing. After all, I'm no warrior. Oh, yes. But perhaps it's our belief in peace that is actually being tested. Thank you. May you live long and prosper. I come in peace to propose peace. One of those peace lovers, Colonel. No, I speak for myself because I abhor violence. But if you accept the solution I offer, they, too, will accept it. No, Colonel. They are at their base awaiting an answer. He talks peace if it is the only way to live. Nothing but the knowledge that I have done what I believe in. Your life and the lives of the others. You said yourself, Colonel, that we have common cause to survive. Together we can. But not by warring. Colonel, surely you accept the logic of this. What is your answer? Men of peace usually are, Captain. On Vulcan, he is revered as the father of our civilisation. The father image holds much meaning for us. Help me, Spock! Spock, help me! Spock! Help me, Spock! Spock! Help me! Help me, Spock! Help me, Spock! Help me, Spock!"

This appears to be an archive or library of some kind. Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our readings indicated that there was no one here at all. Three hours, thirteen minutes. Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select? I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it? Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I Thank you, Mister Atoz. Yes, and where is the captain? Heating this boulder may provide some temporary heat. Something's preventing my phaser from operating. Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you. Are you all right? Agreed. Apparently they've all escaped the destruction of their world by retreating into its past. Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics. There is no library, Captain, at least not that we can see. We are at the base of an ice cliff. Just before you disappeared, Captain, I discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron. Opening time portals to the past. You cross through into the period which you were viewing. I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same instant as Doctor McCoy. Captain! You must be close to the portal. Keep talking now! We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter. In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer. We go together or not at all. We go together. He's suffering from the severity of your weather. Unfortunately, he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally. It is agreeably warm here. I'm called Spock. Prisoners? Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We were sent here by mistake. That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home is a planet millions of light years away. Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am substantial. You are not imagining this. McCoy. McCoy, wake up. No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment. Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest. I shall attempt to find the captain. He's our commanding officer and our friend. He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me where the time portal is? Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid Captain Kirk. It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron. If only I knew more about how it worked. Zarabeth, you said that you were brought here as a prisoner. May I ask I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zor Kahn the Tyrant. Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk. You cannot go back? Come, Doctor, back to bed. It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back. Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return to the library, we shall die. Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is. Captain's log, stardate 5943.9. The people of this time believe in witches, and witchcraft is what I've been accused of. Five witnesses heard McCoy's voice speak to me and thought it was an evil spirit. From what I know of witchcraft trials, I don't have much chance unless I can get to the prosecutor. Really? Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress. And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the Enterprise. Five thousand years in the future. Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is. What was there to do? We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you? Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back means. Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do you understand? The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago. I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure. Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago. I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time. Yes. I know what it is like. If it pleases you. This is animal flesh? Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in the shelter? Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of nourishment. But he evidently intended that you continue living. But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention. I'm not myself. I'm behaving disgracefully. I have eaten animal flesh and I have enjoyed it. What is wrong with me? I tell you you're beautiful. But you are beautiful. Is it so wrong to tell you so? You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known. I've given you the facts, Doctor. You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what difference does it make? She would not jeopardise other lives. What are you doing to her? This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan. My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians. I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back? There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless. You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up. We hear you perfectly, Captain. This must be it. You start ahead, Doctor. I do not wish to part from you. How much time do we have? There's no further need to observe me, Doctor. As you can see, I've returned to the present in every sense. Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she is dead now. Dead and buried. Long ago."

As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim. What is this place? What's wrong? Where's the captain, Spock? We were right behind him. Jim! Jim, can you hear us? He means it's cold. I was looking over some material about their Ice Age. What’s happening? Jim, what's the matter? Jim sounded like he was in trouble. Leave me here, Spock. Don't be a fool. My hands and face are frostbitten. I can't feel my feet. Alone you have a chance. Now do what I say. Go try to find Jim. You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan! Who are you? Zarabeth. Spock, are we in the library? Jim. What about Jim? You find him, Spock. Don't you worry about me. You just find him. Spock? Where are we? Yes, I remember you. Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim? What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back. Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here? Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook. Have you ever been told that? Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those matters. Oh? Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct difference in our approach. No, not yet. And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license. Don't let him doctor you. I'm the doctor around here. I wonder where she is. Thank you. I wonder where Jim is. What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything about it? Locate the portal. It can't be too far. Yes, that was clear to me. I don't believe it, Spock. It’s just not like you to give up trying. Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I understand. You want to stay here. As a matter of fact, you're highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste. You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan. What's happening to you, Spock? Long ago. Of course. Long ago. Spock. You've been dishonest with me, Spock, and that is also something new for you. The facts as you know them. Or did you just accept Zarabeth's word because it's what you wanted to believe? Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness. She would do anything to anybody to change that. Wouldn't you, Zarabeth? Did you? You said we can't get back. The truth is you can't get back. She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She would lie. She would cheat. She would even murder me, the captain, the entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her. Go ahead, Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth. Go ahead. Tell Spock you would kill! Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want? Think. What are you feeling? Rage? Jealousy? Have you ever had those feelings before? The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years. Think, man. What's happening on your planet right now, this very moment? Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock, you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you were born! I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there, and I want that life. I suppose you're right. It’s Jim! Here we are, Jim. Come on, Spock. Come on, Spock, now! Something's wrong. But it did happen, Spock."

What about recent history? It doesn't have to be extensive, Just the answers to a few questions. You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz. Just how many of you are there? We came as soon as we knew what was happening. Did you say they were safe? Where did they go? I see. And you personally sent all these people on the planet to safety? You are the real one, Mister Atoz? Of course. I am the real Mister Atoz. Let us take you with us to a place of safety. We'll choose it as quick as we can. How long till nova?

It's right over there. No. Do you remember when you first saw me? Do you remember whether I came through some kind of door? No. No. It must be here someplace. Bones? Spock? We must've missed each other somehow. No, no. No, no, no. These are friends of mine, and they're Spock, are you in the library? Can you get to the library? Explain. It must have been tied in to the tape viewer somehow. Yes. My friends are coming back with reinforcements. On what charge? That's a mistake. I'm no thief. Keep talking! Jim, what's the matter? Jim sounded like he was in trouble. I'm a stranger. An island. It's called Earth. I never saw that woman before tonight. When she screamed, as far as I could tell, she was being attacked. Yes, I deny it. I was reading in the library when I heard her scream. My lord, the library? Do you remember where the library is, my lord? Surely you don't believe What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall in the library. In the library. My lord, at least arrange for me to meet Mister Atoz. Yes! Yes! Atoz! Let me speak to you! At least let me talk to you! Cry out and I'll break it. Don't move. I'm being falsely accused. You know that. There are no such things as witches! You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth. There are no witches. Why do you deny it? I'll denounce you to the inquisitor. You came here from the future just as I did. Therefore, you, too, are a witch. Then help me. Help me return to the library. I've lost my way. I must get back there. I tell you I must! I had two friends with me, who are lost in another time period. I must find them. You'll come back with us. Prepared? I was not prepared. Your Mister Atoz did not prepare me in any way. Spock? McCoy? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. How much time before the sun blows up? We can't, Scotty. Spock and McCoy are missing. No. Under no circumstances send anyone else here without my orders. Prepare to warp out and stand by. Kirk out. Mister Atoz, where are you? No. Mister Atoz, my friends and I are from another planet. We don't belong in your history. We don't belong on your planet at all. No. I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing. I'm sorry, Mister Atoz. Mister Atoz! I'll let you out in a minute. Still up to your little game of replicas? Which are you this time, real or not? If you help me, we won't die. I promise you that. Which one are you now, the replica or the real one? You don't really want to hurt me, do you? You've been trying to save my life. I realise that. Put that thing away. Now, you're going to help me look for my friends. Kirk here. No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out? Stand by to beam us up. But when that star explodes, don't wait. Get out fast. Kirk out. Now we're going to start looking. They were in a frozen waste. I could hear the wind. We'll both look, Mister Atoz. I don’t know. I didn't see it. Bones? Spock! McCoy! You've got the wrong one. Try again. Bones. Spock! I've found them. Can you still hear me? Follow my voice. Spock, McCoy, follow my voice. Do you hear me? Keep following my voice. Spock. McCoy.  What are you waiting for? Hurry! What are you waiting for? Hurry! Scotty, how much time is there? What's the matter? Why can't he get through? Spock, McCoy, you can't get through unless you both come back at the same time. Scotty. No! Wait! Spock, McCoy, hurry through the portal. Time is running out. He had his escape planned. I'm glad he made it. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, are you there? Beam us aboard and go to maximum warp as soon as we're there. Kirk out. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Then you deny being her accomplice? Perhaps your part in this is innocent. I believe you to be an honest man. Take care, woman. I am convinced of your guilt. Do not compound it with false accusation. You heard these spirits? I know nothing of this. Send for someone learned in witchcraft and let him examine him. I will have nothing to do with it. I know of no Atoz. I know nothing of this, nothing of these matters! I will not hear him! I will not hear him. Jailor! Jailor! You will come with me before the inquisitional tribunal. There the matter of your witchcraft will be decided. Jailor! That is sacrilege. If they hear you, they will burn you for such beliefs. Do not let them hear you. There are witches! There are! You yourself may be discovered to be a witch by the inquisitor. No! What are you doing? No! Help! Help! I beg you. Do not implicate me. They would burn me. I will do everything I can to prove you innocent. I will disprove all the charges of witchcraft. But you must never again speak to the comrades you left behind. You cannot get back. We can never go back. We must live out our lives here in the past. The atavachron has prepared our cell structure and our brain patterns to make life natural here. To return to the future would mean instant death. Then you must get back at once! If you were not transformed, you can only survive for a few hours here in the past. Come. Hurry. Hurry. This is where it is. I can't remember the exact spot. That's it! That is the portal. I cannot wait any longer."

Oh, I took you to be an angler, but you're none of us, are ya? Well, you're a bully fine coe for all of that. What a handsome dish ya served them, the coxcombs. I'm game, love. Lead and I'll follow. Where's library? What's with you, man? Let's make off before coxcombs come with shoulder clappers.  Oh, I think the rum gull must've kicked you in the head. Come on, love. I know a leech who'll ask no questions. Mercy on us. It's spirits. It's spirits. He's a witch! He speaks to unseen spirits. He's a witch! You heard the voices! You're a witch. He cast a spell.

13275,TOS,episode 78,ATOZ,"May I help you? I am the librarian. May I be of assistance? Mister Atoz. I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you. I had thought that everyone had long since gone. But the surprise is pleasant one. After all, a library serves no purpose unless someone is using it. It depended on the individual, of course. If you wish to trace a specific person, I'm sorry, but that information is confidential. Ah, you find it difficult to choose, is that it? Yes, a wide range of alternatives is a mixed blessing, but perhaps I can help. Would you step this way, please? May I help you? You may select from more than twenty thousand verism tapes, several hundred of which have only recently been added to the collection. I'm sure you'll find something here that pleases you. You, sir, what is your particular field of interest? Really? Oh, that's too bad. We have so little on recent history. There was no demand for it. Of course. Reference services available at the desk. You're very late. Where have you been? Of course I know. Everyone on this planet was warned of the coming nova long ago. They followed instructions and are now safe. And you had better do the same. Absolutely. Every single one. Wherever they wanted to go, of course. It is strictly up to the individual's choice. Yes, yes, yes. They are all gone, except you three. Of course, I had to delegate the simple tasks to my replicas. No, thank you. I plan to join my wife and family when the time comes. Now, don't be concerned about me. Think of yourselves. I warn you most urgently. Make your escape before it's too late. The library is at your complete service. I will gladly supply you with all reference material to help you. History of the planet is available in every detail. Just choose what interests you the most. The millennium, the century, the date, the moment. The library is your key. Oh! It's in the wrong file. Make your own selection, but remember, you're very late. You, sir. I think you’ll find something interesting over here. Now, if these won't do, I can bring you another file. Have you made your selection, sir? I'm sure I was clear. The period in which you're interested. Ah, this is the atavachron. Oh, no, sir, no. I must ask you not to touch the controlling mechanism. Return and make your selection. When you have chosen, I will prepare you through the atavachron. Wait! I haven't prepared you. You must be prepared! May I help you? It’s you. You're lucky you found your way back here. Now let me process you through the atava Just let me take care of you and get you back where you belong. Please, go back! I must prepare to escape. You are evidently a suicidal maniac. I don’t understand what you're trying to do, but if you continue, both of us will die. and I for one, do not wish death. I don't trust you. I am the real Atoz. You've done away with my replicas. I regret what I must now do. Just stay where you are, sir. I'll see you get to safety. You're a most determined man. All right, all right. All right! It must be the Sarpeidon Ice Age, five thousand years ago. Let me look. Do you think that's the right one? If we’re to get the portal set for the proper time period, you must be specific. Well try calling out. Please, there's no time left. Let me go. I don't know. Unless, it's because they originally went through the portal together."
13276,TOS,episode 78,LAW,"We are the law, and do require that you yield to us. Thievery and purse cutting. Lord help us. What's that? Away. Away, spirit, and let honest men approach. Here. There's the mort. And there's the mort's henchman. It's truth, my lord. I heard the spirit talk to him. He answered and did call it Bones. Aye, my lord. I'll witness to it. No supper for you, love. Come on. Up you go."
13277,TOS,episode 78,ZARABETH,"What are you called? Even your name is strange. Forgive me. I've never seen anyone who looks like you. Why are you here? Are you prisoners too? This is one of the places Zor Kahn sends people when he wants them to disappear. Didn't you come in through the time portal? The atavachron is far away, but I think you come from someplace farther than that. Oh, how wonderful! I've always loved books about such possibilities. But they are only stories. This isn't real. I must be imagining all this. I'm going mad! Oh, I've been here for so long, alone. When I saw you out there, I couldn't believe it. Is he dying? My name is Zarabeth. Spock, who is this Jim? I saw only the two of you. I did not know there was another. But your friend. He is ill. You make it sound like an equation. Why? My crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely. Two of them were involved in a conspiracy to kill Zor Kahn. It was not enough that he execute my kinsmen. Zor Kahn determined to destroy our entire family. He used the atavachron to send us places no one could ever find us. I can't go through the portal again. If I do, I will die. None of us can go back. When we come through the portal, we are changed by the atavachron. That is its function. Our basic cell structure is adjusted to the time we enter. You can't go back. If you go through the portal again, you will die by the time you reach the other side. You are safe here, McCoy. Not recently. I hadn't noticed it. It’s something to look forward to. I think you must be well enough, Doctor, to try the few delicacies this climate has to offer. At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see. I cannot pretend to be sorry that you are here, though I realise it is a misfortune for you. I'm here against my will too, just as you are. It's not that I wish to return. This is my time now. I've had to face that. But it has been lonely here. Do you know what it's like to be alone? Really alone? I believe you do. Have something to eat, please. There's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid. There's an underground hot spring. There aren't many luxuries around here. Zor Kahn only left me what was necessary to survive. Yes. He gave me weapons, a shelter, food. Everything I needed to live except companionship. He did not want it said that he had me killed. But to send me here alone, if that is not death, what is? A very inventive mind, that man. I have longed to hear you say it. I told you what I know. I don't know. I only know that I can't go back. I cannot come. If I go back, I will die."

13292,TOS,episode 79,SPOCK,"Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings. Approximately seven hundred metres from here. Help will have to be immediate. Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae. It means reversing course. May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our destination. If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her. Their medical facilities are the most primitive. Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor. Is that not crucial to your decision? At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency. Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that our rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled. Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters, I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference. Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship. The crew is becoming increasingly tense. I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears to be primarily mental. Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted. Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind? Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as these might be misinterpreted. Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester. Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light. How is the doctor? Good. I have questions to ask her. Why should he? They are my questions, therefore I am ordering it, Lieutenant. Has such an order ever included his senior officers? By all means, Lieutenant. Complete life-entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device? To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy. That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests. At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the captain for psychological changes. If any facts are uncovered, that would be acceptable evidence. The only kind which is acceptable to Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise. That is true. The captain did not. However, those events have been recorded. They could have become known to you. I believe you. However, my belief is not acceptable evidence. Evidence must be factual. Doctor McCoy may be of help. Come with me. He is not the captain. Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty. It's quite all right, Ensign. Everything is under control. A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir. No physical resistance will be offered. I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T. Kirk. You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief witness. The one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation. Why, Captain? She is dangerous only to your authority, sir. The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put the questions. I know them now. I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position. So far. Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy. They've been witness to many strange events. They are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible, given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon. Not precisely, no. I expect only to reveal the truth. And what will become of Doctor Lester? No, sir. I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made. You are not Captain Kirk. You have ruthlessly appropriated his body, but the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk. You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you. You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you. I do. And I stand by it. Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her. Perhaps you were. To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack. May I point out, Captain I'm sure we all understand that, Captain."

However, Doctor Coleman disagrees. To be specific is essential because the treatment of celebium is quite Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone? Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than waiting. No, not entirely. We both agree it's radiation. Doctor Coleman isn't prepared to say what form of radiation. It's crucial. Oh? I didn't know you knew her that well. Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim. I didn't realise that. I shall do everything in my power. Jim, what are you doing here? Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage, Doctor Coleman. Doctor Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as the symptoms I can detect, Jim. You can't do this! On this ship my medical authority is final! I won't allow it. It's not necessary, Jim. Can't you see she's coming around? A sedative is not wise at this time, Captain. Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions. I'll let my record speak for me. That is not the reason I'm here. I'm here because Doctor Coleman's record states that he's incompetent. No, sir. That is the opinion of Starfleet Command. I checked with them. Doctor Coleman was removed from his post as Chief Medical Officer of his ship for administrative incompetence. As well as flagrant medical blunders. Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain. And certainly not in the Surgeon General's office. I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make. I also find myself in that position now, Jim, and I'm asking you to report for an examination. Development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet. I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives. But you will submit to Starfleet regulations, and they state that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crew member that he has doubts about, including the captain. These tests should help me pinpoint the cause of Jim’s illness. Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him. We've got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin. One of us should be able to get to him. I keep looking for an approach, but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult. You know headquarters, Spock. They're only interested in results of specific tests. So far all we have to offer are our opinions. I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary. Well, then, so be it. Our responsibility is clear. Well, it's worth a try. Why don't you try to get to Doctor Lester while I examine Jim. Jim! Captain. That's enough. That's enough. Your heart will last forever, Captain. In the pink, as usual. Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic rate. Everything, even your glands, functioning at their usual, normal peak of efficiency. Don't get dressed yet. Physically. The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial. It reveals the basic emotional structure. You had one once before. Now I need another one to compare with that previous test. There should be no change in your dermal-optic reactions to the colour wavelengths. Over here, Captain. Over here, Captain. Now lower your arms and open your eyes. There is no positive evidence of any disorder. I'm sure everything's going to be all right. Examining you. Yes, that's correct. The captain is in the best of physical condition. His emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the Enterprise. Scotty. I've been through this with Spock. He's not being scientific and neither are you. Don't you think I know that? My tests show there's nothing wrong with the captain. Now that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be interested in. I don't know. We don't know that. We're talking about mutiny, Scotty. Yes. I'm ready for the vote. We're talking about mutiny, Scotty. That's enough. We know what was said. Then it's possible the transference can be broken. Of course. Come with me."

The death penalty is forbidden. There's only one exception. The captain really must be going mad if he thinks he can get away with an execution. What difference does it make who he is? Are we going to allow an execution to take place? I'll fight them every way and any way I can."
13305,TOS,episode 79,SCOTT,"Mister Scott, sir. Doctor Lester is certainly a very lucky young person to have escaped. Surely you must have more than that to go on. Your evidence is completely subjective. We have to have evidence that we can examine out in the open. Doctor. Doctor, I've seen the captain feverish, sick, drunk, delirious, terrified, overjoyed, boiling mad. But up to now I have never seen him red-faced with hysteria. I know how I'm going to vote. It may not be scientific, but if Mister Spock thinks it happened, then it must be logical. Headquarters has its problems, and we have ours. And right now, the captain of the Enterprise is our problem. They're going to call for the vote in a few minutes. Let me put one last question. Suppose you vote with me, in favour of Spock. That means two votes to one and Spock is free. What do you think the captain'll do? Aye, you know, all right. It'll stick in his craw. He'll never accept it. I tell you, he won't. Then, Doctor, that's the time we move against him. We'll have to take over the ship. Aye. Are you ready for the vote? Then's the time we move against him. We’ll have to take over the ship. Aye. Are you ready for the vote? The bridge is where you belong."
13306,TOS,episode 79,KIRK,"What's wrong with her? Janice, you must remain absolutely quiet. Those are doctor's orders, not mine. I don't blame you. I never stopped you from going on with your space work. No, it isn't. And you punished and tortured me because of it. We'd have killed each other. You had your chance, Captain Kirk. You should've smothered the life in me. Then they would have said Doctor Janice Lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty. Why didn't you do it? You always wanted to. Didn't you? You had the strength to do it. But you were afraid. You were always afraid. Now Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk. I already possess your physical strength. Only this Captain Kirk is not afraid to kill. Now you know the indignity of being a woman. For you this agony will soon pass, as it has for me. Quiet. Quiet! Believe me, it's better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman. It's better to be dead. Doctor McCoy, your report. Was it radiation as suggested? No, nothing at all. She was unconscious all of the time. Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem. Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. Mister Scott. Prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two others. One critically ill. Have a medical team standing by to receive the patient. Captain Kirk, out. Prepare to beam aboard. Doctor Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay. Mister Spock, take the ship out of orbit. Resume designated course. Doctor McCoy. Doctor McCoy, you and Doctor Coleman seem to disagree on diagnosis. Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment? Well, this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons. Oh, yes. It's been a long time since I saw her. I walked out on her when it became serious. Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor McCoy. It's a very unhappy memory for me. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, very lucky. Very lucky. Well you'd better put a stop to it! If you allow Doctor Lester to become fully conscious she'll know what has happened. Probably? I tell you it can't continue. There wasn't enough time. He hung onto life too hard. I couldn't Love? Him? I love the life he led. The power of a starship commander. It's my life now. You are a murderer! You knew it was celebium. You could've treated them for it. You're a murderer many times over. I thought my presence might quiet Doctor Lester. It seems to have had the opposite effect. Didn't Doctor Lester's staff become delirious before they went off and died? Doctor Coleman, Doctor McCoy has had a great deal of experience with radiation exposure on board the Enterprise. I am guided by his opinion. Doctor McCoy, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you off the case and turn it over to Doctor Coleman. Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility. Let him do it. It's done! Doctor Coleman, your patient. Doctor Coleman, didn't you suggest a sedation to rest the patient? Doctor Coleman. James Kirk is returning to consciousness in the body of Janice Lester. The Enterprise is proceeding to its next mission, on the course set before I took over command. Now the years I spent studying every single detail of the ship's operation will be tested. With a little experience, I will be invulnerable to suspicion. At last I attain what is my just due. Command of a starship. All the months of preparation now come to fruition. Course, Mister Chekov. Mister Sulu, set speed at warp factor two. Mister Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony. How long to the colony at our present speed? Mister Sulu, set course for the colony. Three seven three mark eight. Yes, it can't be helped. We must take Doctor Lester to a place where she can be treated. How long to Starbase Two? It's twenty four hours too long. Doctor Lester's condition is increasingly serious. Continue present course. They will have to serve. Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use if Doctor Lester's dead. Time is of the essence. Continue present course. No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant. Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed. Our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved! That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise. Mister Spock, if you’d concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible, Starfleet Command would've been informed already. Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant. Continue present course. Increase speed to warp factor six. Why are you being so defensive? There's no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case. That's the opinion of an individual. There are no administrative duties required here. Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred. You know that, Bones. I'm afraid the order will have to stand. I can only say that Doctor Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here. I’m sure that you can appreciate that. What? What do you base that on? You'll never make that charge stick. Any fool can see why you're doing this. I won't submit to this petty search for revenge! Captain Kirk here. I'll be right there. Well, gentlemen. I'm here, Doctor. She might have killed someone. Put her in isolation in her room. Maintain a twenty four hour watch. No one, absolutely no one, is to talk to her without my permission! How am I otherwise? Good. I hope you're as pleased about it as I am. You said I was in perfect condition. I don't think another test is necessary. Well, are you satisfied with the results of the tests? No hard feelings, Bones. You did your usual thorough, good job. Captain Kirk here. Captain Kirk to Security. On the double to Doctor Lester's room! Phasers. Attention, all personnel. First Officer Spock has been placed under arrest. He has conspired with Doctor Lester to take over the ship from your captain. A hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of a general court martial on the charge of mutiny. Captain's Log, stardate 5930.3. The results of Doctor McCoy's examination have given me complete confidence in myself. My fears are past. I shall function freely as the captain. I am the captain of the Enterprise, in fact. She's dangerously insane. We've seen the evidence. Mister Spock. Mister Spock, my authority has been given to me by Starfleet Command, and only that high authority can take it away. Mister Lemli, have Doctor Janice Lester brought here. Doctor McCoy, while Mister Spock was busy with his ambitious plot, what were you doing? Oh, yes. You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and physical, since leaving Camus Two. Is that correct? Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to help me. Doctor McCoy, for the record, will you tell the court your findings? Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock, were you aware of Doctor McCoy's findings? And what have you to say now? Doctor Coleman, if you’re required here, we'll call you. We certainly appreciate your being here. Everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress. We had hoped to avoid any further stress, but Mister Spock disagrees. It is his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case. And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision, I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions. I'll try not to upset you. You claim that, that you are Captain James T. Kirk? Oh. Well. However, as I understand it, I am Doctor Janice Lester. A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement. Violence by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk? I ask the assembled personnel to look at Doctor Janice Lester and visualise that historic moment. Can you, can you tell me why Doctor Janice Lester would agree to this ludicrous exchange? Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do. Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Doctor Janice Lester? Oh. Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect Starfleet Command to place this er, this er, person in command of the Enterprise? And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain, and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then you would be the captain! It is inevitable! Spock. Spock, give it up! Return to the Enterprise family. All charges will be dropped and the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on Camus Two will fade and be forgotten. Doctor Lester will be cared for always. It is a debt and a responsibility I owe her from the past. Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Mister Spock's tirade. You heard the statements placed into the record by you. Do you understand the nature of it? It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base! But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny. Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, you heard it! On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote, by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise. A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote. Silence. You will be silent! A recess has been declared. There will be no cross-discussion. When I return, we will vote on the charge of mutiny. The evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision. Play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor. Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers. And you're so charged. The sentence, death. Mister Lemli. All my senior officers turning against me? I am responsible. The execution will be immediate. Go to your posts. Go to your posts. Mister Lemli, take them to the brig. Prepare for execution. Go on! Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision. Have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck. Mister Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony? Plot co-ordinates for orbit. Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished. Interment will take place on Benecia. You have received your orders! You will obey my orders. You’ll be charged with mutiny! You will obey my orders or, or, Arthur, the transference is weakening. For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners. I will not go back to being Janice Lester. You must help me prevent it. I can't. I can't. The crew is in mutiny. You must kill her for me. Then do it for yourself. If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be exposed as murderers. Does that give you any choice? The dosage should be doubly lethal. To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate cells. If there’s any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn co-operation. Doctor Lester will be first. Follow Doctor Coleman. Kill him! Kill him! Can you do anything for her? I didn't want to destroy her. Her life could have been as rich as any woman's, if only. If only. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

It isn't fair. I loved you. We could've roamed among the stars. It might have been better. Oh no. Am I really losing command of the Enterprise? No. Oh, no. Bad dream. Bad dream. Pulse, pressure, blood count, all body functions normal. Then why am I here? Doctor McCoy? Doctor McCoy Where's Doctor McCoy? Bring Doctor McCoy at once! He is in command of medicine on this ship. By Captain Kirk? I am not Janice Lester! She did this to me! Now how can I make you understand? Janice has driven herself mad with jealousy, hatred and ambition. Nurse Chapel. Bring Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy to me at once. Now they must believe I am not Janice Lester. I am imprisoned in her body, but I am not Janice Lester. I am not Janice Lester! I must've sounded quite mad to you before. Well, I'll be all right now. Could I see your Doctor McCoy? Oh. Is a visit by that very kind Mister Spock to be allowed? The Benecia Colony? But isn't the Enterprise going to rendezvous with the Potemkin at Beta Aurigae? Well, I'll try. Thank you. Oh, it is good. Thank you. Could I finish it slowly, Nurse Chapel? I promise I'll be good. Spock. Bones. Help me. Don't let them lock me away from you. I've got to talk to you. Yes, that's what it must've been. It was accomplished and forgotten long ago on Camus Two. I am a living example. Nevertheless, Spock, it is the truth I'm speaking. Kirk is being bathed in coloured light with his eyes closed) Spock, when I was caught in the interspace of the Tholian Sector, you risked your life and the Enterprise to get me back. Help me get back now. When the Vians of Minara demanded that we let Bones die, we didn't permit it. You are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe. You know his thoughts. What does your telepathic mind tell you now? No. I am not Captain Kirk. That is very apparent. I claim that whatever it is that makes James Kirk a living being special to himself is being held here in this body. That's very clever, but I didn't say it. I said, the body of James Kirk is being used by Doctor Janice Lester. No. It was brought about by a violent attack by Doctor Lester and the use of equipment she discovered on Camus Two. Yes. To get the power she craved, to attain a position she doesn't merit by temperament or training. And most of all, she wanted to murder James Kirk, a man who once loved her. But her intense hatred of her own womanhood made life with her impossible. For a moment, I thought that I was up on the bridge. Well, if it happens again, I'll fight to stay there. Ohh! I've lost to the captain. I've lost to James Kirk! I want you dead! I want you dead! I want you dead! Oh, I'm never going to be the captain. Never. Kill him. Kill him."

13741,TOS,episode 79,COLEMAN,"Exposure to radiation. Nothing I've ever encountered.   Doctor McCoy. Doctor Lester is near death. I'm sure it is. I don't know. I'm not sure. It just began. Probably no one will believe it. That's all we can ask for. How can death be explained now? You killed every one of the staff. You sent them where you knew the celebium shielding was weak. Now why didn't you kill him? You had the perfect opportunity. I gave you every minute you asked for. You couldn't because you love him. You want me to be his murderer. I won't become a murderer. It has nothing to do with you. It's a symptom of the developing radiation illness. Yes, Captain. Yes. Doctor Lester and her staff have been under my supervision for two years. If you don't follow my recommendations, responsibility for her health or her death will be yours. Yes, Captain. Nurse, administer the sedative. Nurse Chapel, you have your orders. Quiet would be best for you. I'm in charge now. He was taken off your case by Captain Kirk. It was done for your own protection, Doctor Lester. She is suffering from the delusion of being Captain Kirk. The paranoia has been developing for the past six months. The radiation seems to have intensified it. She must be kept sedated. Of course. You are insane, Doctor Lester. Captain's log, stardate unknown. I have lost track of time. I am still held captive in a strange body and separated from all my crew. What happened? The only way to prevent the transference is by the death of Janice Lester. You must carry out the execution. I have done everything else for you. But I will not murder for you. It is. You are, you are as I loved you. I'd like to take care of her."
