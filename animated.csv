0,TAS,episode 0,MCCOY,"If its pull is this strong, Jim, how do we get out of orbit? It's a starship like nothing I've ever seen. The size of it. Barely an instant in eternity, Jim. Must have been some accident to get almost every pod. Gives me the creeps. I feel like something's watching us. You mean we're trapped here? No communication, nothing? Jim, the door. What is it? A message from three hundred million years ago? Hurry up, Spock. The force field of his belt won't hold that weight for long, Jim. Jim, you don't think that's going to help us? Whatever that thing is, it survived millennia in a dead hulk. All it has to do is outlast us and just take over."
1,TAS,episode 0,GREEN,"You are correct, Captain James T Kirk, and I have the starship I've waited for so long, so terribly long. You will now remove the static shield from the navigation console, Captain James T Kirk. All nonessential systems are extinguished. You will obey me. Obey me! Obey me! Remove the static shied from the warp drive controls! Do it now! Repair the warp drive controls. Obey me! You will leave this orbit and plot course to galactic coordinates zero three six point two three one. Complete repairs! Obey me! That is correct. You will activate the manual controls. Obey! Apply full power! Obey me! No! Accelerate! Do not destroy the ship! Obey me! Obey! Obey! No! Don't! Please, don't! Don't leave me alone. Please, please. So lonely. Captain's log, stardate 5221.8. Final entry. Resuming outward course beyond the farthest star of our galaxy. Mission, starcharting. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

2,TAS,episode 0,SULU,"She's not answering the helm, sir. Two minutes right ascension off course and drifting farther, Captain. Standing by, sir. Captain, we're still gaining speed. No good, sir. We're still falling toward it. Aye, aye, Captain. Aye, aye, Captain. Aye, aye, sir. Yes, sir. Good work, Mister Kyle. I thought we lost them when we were cut off so long. Bridge to Captain Kirk. Something's activating the ship's phaser banks. They're locking on the alien starship. Phaser banks were off, Captain. They activated themselves. No, sir. That's the heart of the galaxy, Captain. Captain, we're dropping out of orbit! We're falling into the dead sun."
3,TAS,episode 0,KYLE,"Ready, Captain. Located them right after that explosion, Mister Sulu. We're locked on and beaming them aboard. Piece of cake, sir. Here they come now. Captain, something's beamed aboard with you."
4,TAS,episode 0,ALIEN,"Danger. Danger. The dead star, we are being drawn to it. Rather than carry this malevolent life form to other worlds, we have decided to destroy our own ship. There is no other answer. If you understand this message, you are protected only for this moment in this room. This thing it wants"
5,TAS,episode 0,SCOTT,"We've picked up speed, sir, rapidly. I've cut back power, but we continue to gain momentum. Would you look at this now? This metal, it isn't cast or rolled. It was drawn into filaments and spun. Aye, from the inside, from the looks of them. The structure of the ship, those huge arches, thrusting up. The whole ship is designed to receive and store energy. I feel it too, Captain. We can cut our way out of here. Something to shield this room. But shield it from what? But nothing, no form of life could survive three hundred million years. No damage to hull or engines, Captain. That alien commander, sir. The message said that they had to destroy their own ship. Aye, sir. It's no use, sir. The mechanism is frozen. They've already tried. I thank you, sir. Sir, we cannot get into the core. Drained of all energy, sir. Aye, Captain. Auxiliary controls ready to activate, Captain."
6,TAS,episode 0,KIRK,"Situation, Mister Scott? Mister Sulu? Stand by to reverse course. Reverse course. Why aren't our sensors picking it up? Forward scanners, Mister Sulu. Full reverse thrust. How much time do we have? Sulu, flank speed ahead. Our only chance is to try to get into orbit around that thing. Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu. Maintain orbit. Slingshot effect, Mister Spock? Do we have enough power? Put us alongside, Mister Sulu. It's been damaged. I'll bet she was pulled in like we were. You're sure, Mister Spock? Can you identify that metal, or the design of the ship? A civilisation that advanced three hundred million years ago before life even emerged on Earth. Mister Spock, any indication of that ship's power source? We'll board her, Mister Spock. Scotty, Bones, you'll come with us. We'll need life-support belts. Mister Sulu, have the Transporter room stand by. Activate life-support belts. Energise. Like a spider spins his web. Look, every pod, they've all been burst open. Kirk to Enterprise. Lieutenant, are you still getting that radio signal from this ship? All right. Lock on us with the transporter and be ready to transport. We're going inside. What do you make of it, Spock? You mean it's functioning after all the milleniums this ship has been here? Compared to the beings that built this ship, we are primitive people, even you, Mister Spock. All right, let's keep going. Tricorder analysis, Mister Spock. Enterprise, do you read me? Sulu? No energy registering. Something's drained them. For the moment. This is, was, the control centre of the starship. These must be control and navigational instruments. Will it hold? I'm not sure, but I think It could be a ship's log or a warning. It seems to keep repeating. Anything? Get out of here! Hurry! Transport it back out. Status? So, we're all just fine, but whatever was on that ship used our transporter beam to come aboard with us, and now it's here. Until we learn more about it, Scotty, perhaps we should be ready to do the same. Take two of your men and arm the self-destruct device in the Engineering core. Mister Spock, any change in ship's readings? Like the beating of a heart. Bridge to Sickbay. Bones, get down to the Engineering core on the double. Get on those life-support systems now. Override systems, Mister Spock. Open the core hatch. All right, get the cutter beams on that hatch. Move. And mutual override did not work? The cutter beams. Spock, can you rig a low-frequency shield like the one on the alien ship, on our navigation console? Do it. Do you get a magnetic flux reading there now? No. It must be held by the magnetic force of the dead star, and it needs a starship to break free and a crew to man it. You have shut down life-support systems and endangered members of my crew. Restore those systems first. And if I refuse? Stop! You'll hurt him. I'll obey. Let him go. Mister Scott, start repairs. Install the auxiliary controls. What are we dealing with, Spock? A slingshot effect to yank us out of orbit. Can you compute it in your mind? If we try to use ship's computers The engineer will need aid from my first officer to complete repairs. Is that permitted? I guess it is. Plot the course, Mister Sulu. I'm aware of that, Mister Spock. The auxiliary warp drive controls can only be operated manually. Controls activated. Standby to activate warp drive unit. Activate warp drive! Is it gone?"
7,TAS,episode 0,SPOCK,"I can only describe it as hypergravity, Captain, more powerful than any we've ever encountered. It's dragging the Enterprise toward it. Negative star mass. Spectra analysis, imploded matter, but every reading on it is negative. Impact in ninety three seconds. Ninety two. Ninety one. Forty seconds, Captain. Thirty nine, thirty eight. Nine seconds. Eight, seven. Orbital velocity. I'll need some time for the computations, Captain. Confirmed, Captain, but it isn't possible. That ship is dead. Temperature is absolute zero. There is no thermal reading to support life aboard her, and no energy store to send radio messages. Nothing except a slight magnetic flux reading which could be normal for the ship's metal. Probability point nine nine seven, Captain. Negative to both, Captain. Unknown alloy, harder and lighter than any registered metal. It is not a recorded galactic starship design. Retro analysis of the ship's spectra dates it as having been in orbit here for slightly more than three hundred million years. No, Captain, but this far from a G1 star, it is logical to assume they had some kind of warp drive. The hexagonal shape of the windows suggests a similarity to natural insect designs of Earth, the honeycombs of bees. The individual cells are shaped precisely like this. A lighter and stronger material than anything we have now. Accidents seldom have such system, Doctor McCoy. I believe we must consider the alternative possibility that the crew of this ship destroyed her themselves. Captain's log. We have beamed aboard the alien ship found orbiting a strange dead star. The Enterprise is recording all data for the log and a full report later. Captain, its registering energy. Very little, but building. The wands are accumulators, receptors to attract energy, motion, sound, light, heat, every kind of energy around them. A physiological symptom of latent primal superstition, the fear of primitive people confronting something unknown to them. Artificial gravity is in effect here, Captain. Both air and gravity within two points of Earth normal. No use, Captain. Some sort of interference has been set up. The source of the interference is here, Captain. It's not part of the normal equipment. It's like something they jury-rigged during an emergency. Possibly from whatever had come aboard their ship. Quite right, Mister Scott. No known form of life. Something is trying to get in. The field of interference is reacting against the magnetic flux lines, Captain. If the energy stays at that level. It is possible that this much of their technology survived. I may be able to get a translation. Patience, Doctor. Automatic bridge defence system on and prepared, sir. We're registering a slightly higher than normal magnetic flux. Not dangerous, but the level isn't constant. It seems to fluctuate, a steady, almost pulsing rhythm. Trouble in the Engineering core, sir. Something's jammed the circuits. They're magnetised. Exactly like the Engineering controls and the life-support systems on decks five and six. Power out on all but key levels, Captain. High magnetic flux reading. It would have a very small field. It's activated, Captain, but only an area three metres square. Negative, Captain. It has absorbed the memory banks, Captain, all of them. Captain! No, Captain. I'm all right, Captain. High rank probabilities, Captain. It is a magnetic organism without mass, but capable of symbiotic relationship with a host body, a starship for instance. It is a form of primal energy, and it can utilise the electronic control systems of a starship like the mind of a man uses the neural control systems of the human body. It has become the Enterprise, and we are only life-support organisms in its body like the white corpuscles in human blood. And Captain, the magnetic flux readings are higher. It is growing stronger, building itself. The alien will know. I believe I can, Captain. I will need to aid Mister Scott. Captain, this symbiont can reproduce itself by mitosis and take over every starship we encounter. It can control computer centres, whole planets. Activated, Captain. Affirmative. It fled the ship when it thought we would crash into the dead star."
8,TAS,episode 0,UHURA,"Captain, that's the source of the radio emissions. Captain, there's another signal. Listen. I'm getting that radio sound again, sir. Nine seconds right ascension from galactic plane, dead ahead and closing fast. It's on the viewscreen now, sir. It's coming from that ship, Captain. It's beautiful. What kind of people could have built it, to touch even a starship with grace and beauty? Enterprise. Lieutenant Uhura here. Negative, Captain. It stopped transmitting when you beamed aboard. Transporter beam on and locked. Standing by. Sickbay reports no injuries to crew, sir. Bridge, Lieutenant. What? Captain, decks five and six report shutdown of all life-support systems. They've gone to life-support belts, manual override is not responding. Sir, Cargo holds three, four and five just shut down life-support systems. Captain Kirk, the ship's computers. Something's going through every storage bank. It seems to be taking control of the whole ship."

11,TAS,episode 1,MCCOY,"Who's he, Jim? Afraid I don't, Jim. Oh, I thought sure you'd know Thelin by now, Jim. He's been your first officer for five years. Well, well, well. So you two finally got back from your vacation. While you've been running all over Orion's creation, I've been running the annual crew physicals. You're the last ones. Never mind the chit-chat. I've got my medical scanners all set up for a Vulcan. I have to recalibrate every time I run a physical on you, Spock. What's that supposed to mean? If that was supposed to be a joke, Spock, I have to remind you Vulcans don't tell jokes."

16,TAS,episode 1,SCOTT,"Enterprise. Aye, sir. Captain, I was expecting there to be one of the historians with you. But a Vulcan? Sir? Two to beam up. Aye, sir."
17,TAS,episode 1,KIRK,"What a trip, Bones. Orion, at the dawn of its civilisation. Even just observing, not touching anything for fear of changing some piece of history. What's the matter? Bones? What do you mean, who's he? You know Mister Spock. Kirk to Enterprise. Beam up. Explain yourself, Mister Scott. I don't know what's going on, but the first officer of this ship will be treated with respect. Who are you? No, but if it's reality, what happened? Captain's log, supplemental. When we were in the time vortex, something appears to have changed the present as we know it. No one aboard recognises Mister Spock. The only answer is that the past was somehow altered. But something was changed. But I know who you are, and no one else aboard does. While we were in Orion's past, the time revision that took place here didn't affect me. Kirk here. Your findings? It is in this case. If we didn't change anything while we were in the time vortex, someone else must have. Was the Guardian in use while we were gone? Was there any notation on the death of Ambassador Sarek's son? This cousin, what was his name? Spock, did Selek look like you do now? But this time, you were in Orion's past with us when the historians had the time vortex replay Vulcan history. You couldn't be in two places at once, so you died as a boy. Guardian! Did you hear that? Is it possible for Spock to return to Vulcan and repair the timeline that has been broken so all is the same as before? You have to remember, for you and your mother to live. You've got it. I'll order the wardrobe section to prepare it now. Nice to know the crew is efficient in this time plane, too. Spock. I sent the others up to the ship. What happened? A pet? Well, that wouldn't mean much in the course of time. Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up. Welcome aboard, Mister Spock."
18,TAS,episode 1,SPOCK,"Captain, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a game. It seems, Captain, I am the only one affected. The mission, the ship, the crew, except for myself, remain the same. That is not correct. I wish to ask a question. What of Sarek's family, his wife and son? My mother. The son, what was his name and age when he died? What time period? The kahs-wan, a survival test traditional for young males. The twentieth day of Tasmeen. That was the day my cousin saved my life in the desert when I was attacked by a wild animal. I do not recall clearly. I was very young. He called himself Selek. He was visiting us, but I never saw him after that. I believe so, Captain. And I know what you're thinking. It was I who saved myself that other time. I do not remember everything. There is a vague memory from a child's point of view, but the details are not clear. Yes. I will need a Vulcan desert soft suit and boots, and a small selection of streetwear circa 8877 Vulcan years. The carry bag should be of the same period. Andorians are not known for their charity. And you in yours, Commander Thelin. I wish to visit the planet Vulcan, thirty years past, the month of Tasmeen. Location, near the city of ShirKahr. That is not true. My father 2 In the family, all is silence. No more will be said of it. Live long and prosper, Sarek of Vulcan. My name is Selek, an humble cousin descended of T'Pel and Sasak. I am journeying to the family shrine to honour our gods. I am honoured. Is something wrong, Cousin? A family resemblance to our forefathers, no doubt. Yes, father. Yes, father. Yes, father. No, my lady Amanda. Any child has much to learn. My young cousin has a more difficult road to travel than others. It is difficult for a father to bear less than perfection in his son. Spock will find his way. The boy goes through the kahs-wan ordeal soon, does he not? But tomorrow is the twentieth day of Tasmeen. I seem to have lost track of time. What if I do, father? I-Chaya. what if I'm not a true Vulcan like they say? Personal log, stardate 5373.9, subjective time. The timeline seems to have changed again. Yet I do not believe I have done anything to disrupt it. My memory is quite clear regarding the date my cousin saved my life, and it is tomorrow. The kahs-wan ordeal is an ancient rite of warrior days. When Vulcans turned to logic, they reasoned they must maintain the tests of courage and strength to keep pure logic from making them weak and helpless. Y No, I-Chaya, this is my own test. I have to do it alone. Stay. Of course. I should have remembered. It wasn't the actual kahs-wan ordeal. Y I-Chaya, go home. You are too old and too fat for this. That's how you always get around mother, but it does not work with me. Go home, I-Chaya. Personal log. The boy Spock should be moving toward the Llangon Mountains. He, I had much to prove to myself. The personal ordeal upon which I embarked was meant to determine the course my life would take. I-Chaya, good boy. I suggest we move away from this area before the le-matya regains consciousness. Y Thank you for helping me and I-Chaya. It was my duty, Spock. Y Mother says you should always say thank you. The lady Amanda is known for her graciousness.  Y Do you think I'll ever be able to do that neck pinch as well as you? I dare say you will. Come now. Y You followed me. Why? I suspected you would go. You are worried about the kahs-wan ordeal. Y I had to see if I could do it. A personal test. I cannot fail. That is your father's wish? Y Yes, and my mother's. They, they confuse me. Father wants me to do things his way, and Mother says I should. But then she goes She is a human woman, with strong emotion and sensitivities. She embarrasses you with those traits, and you are afraid when you see them in yourself. Y How did you know? There is some human blood in my family line. It is not fatal. What you do not yet understand, Spock, is that Vulcans do not lack emotion. It is only that ours is controlled. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience in full. We have emotions but we deal with them and do not let them control us. Y I-Chaya! The le-matya struck him with its poison claws in the fight. Y Is he dying? Yes. Personal log. Something unexpected has again occurred. The sehlat, I-Chaya, was struck by the poisonous claws of the le-matya he fought. He is dying, unless we can find a healer, and soon. We cannot get him back to the city to a healer. He is too large to move. Y Then what? You are a Vulcan. What is the logical thing to do? Y I can bring a healer here. It is a long journey across the desert. There are many dangers. I will go. Y No. This is my duty. No one else can do it for me. Will you stay with him? This did not happen before. My life decision was made without the sacrifice of yours, old friend. I know there is pain. I can help a little. Sleep now. Most urgent, Healer. My sehlat fought a le-matya in the Llangon foothills. He suffered a small wound, but the poison of its claws is working in him now. Please, you must come with me. He needs your healing. Yes, Healer. I did that once, two years ago. Healer, I would not call you out unless a life was in danger. Have you ever heard the son of Sarek was a liar? Healer, please hurry. It will not be long now, old friend. You made the desert crossing most efficiently. You will not disappoint Sarek in your kahs-wan. Y I wanted only to help I-Chaya. He was my father's before he was mine. To lose him A Vulcan would face such a loss without tears. Y How? By understanding every life comes to an end when time demands it. Loss of life is to be mourned but only if the life was wasted. I-Chaya's was not. Yes, sir? Is there nothing you can do? Release him. It is fitting he dies with peace and dignity. Y I regret having troubled you in any way, but it was necessary. There was a decision to be made. A direction for my life had to be chosen. I chose Vulcan. Thank you, father. If you will excuse me now, I have some business to conduct with schoolmates. A demonstration of the Vulcan neck pinch. Our cousin taught me. I too must make my farewells. Your hospitality has been most kind, but I must journey on. Try to understand your son, Sarek of Vulcan. It will be repayment enough for me. I think I shall not. Peace and long life. One small thing was changed this time. A pet died. It might, to some. Doctor McCoy, you do not know your good fortune. IF the times were different, you would have to recalibrate for an Andorian. Times change, Doctor. Times change. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

22,TAS,episode 1,BATES,"Sir, we've checked the Starfleet records Commander Thelin asked for. There is no Vulcan named Spock serving with the Starfleet in any capacity. Yes, sir. I can relay that to your screen. Sarek of Vulcan. Ambassador to seventeen Federation planets in the past thirty years. Amanda, wife of Sarek. Born on Earth as Amanda Grayson. The couple separated after the death of their son. The wife was killed in a shuttle accident at Lunaport on her way home to Earth. Ambassador Sarek has not remarried. Spock. Age seven."
23,TAS,episode 1,ERIKSON,Nothing. I can't find one thing we did when we were in the vortex that could possibly have affected the future.
24,TAS,episode 1,GUARDIAN,"I hear all. It is possible if no other major factor is changed. The time and place are ready to receive you. Personal log, stardate 5373.5, subjective time. I have returned to the past in an attempt to restore the future. I am home and I had almost forgotten its beauty. The traveller is returning."
25,TAS,episode 1,HEALER,"The hour is late. I trust your errand is urgent? Y You are Spock, son of Sarek, are you not? Y I have heard of you. I have heard of a tendency toward what humans call practical jokes. Y No. That has never been said. Very well. Wait here and I will get my medicines. Y Spock. Y It has been too long. No antidote known will save his life. Y I can prolong his life, but he will be in pain. Or I can release him from life. I will need your decision. He is your pet. Y"
26,TAS,episode 1,AMANDA,"I hope you were not disturbed by my son's behaviour, Selek. You seem to understand him better than my husband. I hops so. I respect Vulcan and all its traditions, but it is a demanding life. Next month. Yes. Is something wrong? Sarek, our son and the visitor are gone. You don't think he'd harm Spock?"
27,TAS,episode 1,GREY,"Cease review. Yes, but it was nothing unusual. We were scanning recent Vulcan history. Twenty to thirty Vulcan years past."
28,TAS,episode 1,BOY,"Earther! Barbarian! Emotional Earther! You're a Terran, Spock. You could never be a true Vulcan. Y Your father brought shame to Vulcan. He married a human. You haven't even mastered a simple Vulcan neck pinch yet, Earther."
29,TAS,episode 1,SAREK,"My apologies, visitor. I regret you were witness to that unfortunate display of emotion on the part of my son. Peace and long life. You are of my family? You have a long way to go. Will you break your journey with us for a while, Cousin? No, no. It was only that it seemed I know you. No doubt. Well, come then. Allow me to welcome you to my home. Spock. Spock, being Vulcan means following disciplines and philosophies that are difficult and demanding of both mind and body. Y You constantly display your emotions. You have even been seen fighting in the street. Y The time draws near when you will have to decide whether you will follow Vulcan or human philosophy. Vulcan offers much. No war, no crime. Order, logic and control in place of raw emotions and instinct. Once on the path you choose, you cannot turn back. Y Soon you will undergo your test of adulthood in the desert. To survive for ten days without food, water or weapon on Vulcan's Forge will demand more of you than anything ever has. To fail once is not a disgrace for others. If you fail, there will be those who will call you a coward all your life. I do not expect you to fail. Y There is no need to ask that question. You will not disappoint me. Not if your heart and spirit are Vulcan. Y This cousin, Selek, something strange about him. I don't know, Amanda. I will notify the authorities and ask them to initiate a search. Y I trust you can explain why it was necessary? Y It is good then. You have comported yourself with honour. We will see I-Chaya is brought home from the mountains. Y Business? Y You saved my son's life, Selek. There is no way I can fully repay you for that. A strange request, but I will honour it. My home is yours if you pass this way again. Live long and prosper, cousin."
30,TAS,episode 1,THELIN,"Captain, I assure you no one has ever treated me otherwise. Did you also research the Vulcan family history requested? How do you know this? This change in the timeline will put you in my place, yet I am not aggrieved. True. A warrior race has few sympathies, but one we do possess is for family. In your time plane, you will live and so will your mother. That is valuable. Live long and prosper in your world, Commander Spock."

32,TAS,episode 2,MCCOY,"Jim, if we can't stop it, millions of people will die. How much time do they have? It's certain there'd be planetwide panic. Who's the governor of Mantilles, Jim? Then tell him. It's still got us. We're floating inside the cloud. There's some resemblance. I don't know how much we can depend on it. But I'll tell you one thing. We have to get out of this area. Those mists out there are acting something like a macromorphase enzyme. If the shields don't stay up, the hull will be corroded and we'll all be broken down into nice digestible particles. I think they perform the same function as teeth. They break up the larger chunks of matter for digestion. If this thing does have some kind of digestive system, we don't stand much of a chance of making it that far. What do we do now, knock? I think we're in what corresponds to the small intestine. Those things growing out of the wall would be similar to villi. The human small intestine is lined with millions of them, to absorb nutrients into the body. It's pretty certain to be the brain, Jim. The functioning of the brain is basically electric. But you can't let this thing destroy over eighty million lives, either. That sounds like you're telling us to blow up the ship. Who's Katie? Jim, if we don't self-destruct now all those people will die."

At warp eight, we will intercept the cloud before it reaches the inhabited planet Mantilles. But we are uncertain what we can do to stop a matter-energy cloud which measures thousands of times more than our vessel. Coming up on the cloud, sir. five minutes, ten seconds. Captain. Full reverse, sir. Locked on. Phasers ready, sir. Firing. No effect, Captain Captain, objects approaching on the bow. More objects approaching aft, sir. Antimatter charge ready, sir. Ready, sir. Aye, aye, sir. We've reached the entrance to the central core, Captain. Yes, sir. I can't hold it on course, sir. We're using all power. Thirty one minutes and four seconds to Mantilles, sir.

37,TAS,episode 2,SCOTT,"Engineering to Captain Kirk. Captain, the power drain on the shields is too heavy to hold for any length of time. Aye, sir. Engineering out. Scott to Bridge. Keeping the deflectors this high Is putting an enormous strain on the engines, Captain. Especially the antimatter. What with the maximum power demands and all, the reserve is falling fast. Twenty one minutes, sir. But if the indicator goes below two anti-kilos, the engines won't regenerate. If we don't stop the power drain right now, that'll be the end of us. Captain, you said that villi are antimatter. If we could get a piece of it, I could put it in the antimatter engine and it would regenerate. We'd have enough power for the engines and the shields to go on maximum again. Matter's no problem. We could beam aboard some of the planet chunks out there. And we can cut a piece of the antimatter villi with the tractor beams and transport it aboard like that. I can rig a force field box that'll hold the villi suspended in the centre. Then I can take it into the antimatter nacelle, put it into the regenerating chamber and release the forcefield by remote control. The force field is holding. Let's go. Well, that gives us two minutes. All right, Gabler, open it. Close it. Thank you, sir. Engineering. Scott here. Aye, sir. The procedure is ready, sir. Awaiting your order, Captain."
38,TAS,episode 2,KIRK,"Readings? Put up our present position, Lieutenant Arex. Reading, Spock? Spock, is it possible the cloud consumes planets? That's impossible. Mantilles will die. Mister Sulu, increase speed to warp eight. Push it to the limit. Bones, I need an expert psychological opinion. Do we dare tell the people on Mantilles, try to save a few who could get away? Blind panic. Bob Wesley. He left Starfleet for the governorship. He's no hysteric. Thanks, Bones. Lieutenant Uhura, send a priority one call to Governor Wesley on Mantilles. What kind? Evasive action. Reverse full power. Prepare to fire all phasers into cloud mass. Fire. Deflector shields on. Analysis, Spock? Kirk here. I know, Scotty. Scotty, prepare the shields for an antimatter charge. Fire. Double the charge. Fire. Well, Spock, any conclusions? Bones, any opinion? Transfer it to my quarters. Mister Sulu, use your scanners to assemble a diagram of the cloud's composition and feed it to the library computer. You have time to save some people, Bob. How are you going to choose? In three hours and twenty minutes the cloud will reach Mantilles. Millions of people will die. I need your help, gentlemen. Your analyses? Agreed. Judging from the disappearance of Alondra, the cloud lives on the energy it converts from the planets it consumes. What about those blobs, Bones? Lieutenant, let's see what the scanners have come up with on the cloud's composition. It seems to have some sort of anatomy. Arex, where are we on that chart? The opening where we were drawn in seems to have closed. But there's another opening up there on top. Thank you, Mister Arex. Since we appear to have only one way out, we're going to take it. Mister Sulu, takes us to that central core area. And if this thing does have a stomach, we just might be able to give it enough indigestion to make it turn away from Mantilles. No need, Bones. Here we go. Villi? We'll explode. Mister Sulu, keep the deflectors up at all costs. Incredible. They're destroyed on contact with the matter this thing takes in and then they regenerate immediately. Yes, Scotty. How much time do we have? Thank you, Mister Scott. Mister Arex, try to make your way through to the opening on the other side. Increase deflector shields to maximum. And if we do stop, we'll be drawn into one of the villi and the ship will explode. We need both the matter and the antimatter engines regenerated. Bring it aboard? If the antimatter touches the inside of the ship or any of us, we'll be blown to bits. Scotty, we've got ten minutes left. Scotty, you've just given the Enterprise and Mantilles a chance to live. Situation, Mister Spock? Intelligent? Where is the brain located? If we can reach it before the cloud gets to Mantilles, we might be able to save the planet. We'll use the photon torpedoes to destroy the brain. I know the regulations against the killing of intelligent life forms, Mister Spock. But we don't know this life form is intelligent. And we do know the people on Mantilles are doomed if we don't stop it. If I have to be a judge, I decide in favour of saving Mantilles. Captain's log, stardate 5372.0. Spock and Uhura are using our sensors to prepare a detailed chart so we may determine targets for our photon torpedoes. Am I doing the right thing, Bones? Once, I said, man rose above primitiveness by vowing 'I will not kill today.' Your figures are specific and absolutely correct, of course? You're sure it will do the job? Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott, prepare the self-destruct mechanism in the Engineering core. Computer control will be on the Bridge when it's time to trigger it. Put it on the viewscreen, Lieutenant. Bob. Is the evacuation proceeding? I know. Bob, where's Katie? Don't worry, Bon. She'll be all right. Goodbye. His daughter. She's eleven. Spock, is there any way we could establish whether or not it is definitely intelligent? Perhaps a Vulcan mind touch. Can you do it in time? All right, Spock. Get at it. Captain's log, stardate 5372.1. The cloud will reach Mantilles in seven minutes. Spock has been working on the mechanics of reaching the cloud's thoughts, but I doubt if there's any time left. And even if we do establish contact, can we communicate with it and persuade it not to kill? Thank you, Scotty. How near is Mantilles, Mister Arex? Bones, he's the cloud. Its thoughts are here. Don't move. Lieutenant, use the library computer. Put some views of the Earth onto that screen. This is the thing we come from. Lieutenant, this is what I want. A few seconds, Scotty. We have to give Spock that much. Quiet. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Governor Wesley. Tell him to bring his ships back. Spock, you did it! The cloud is leaving. Mister Sulu, let's get out of here, through that grid. Spock, what did you perceive?"
39,TAS,episode 2,SPOCK,"Captain, we are now approaching sensor range of the cloud. It seems to be of irregular shape, some eight hundred thousand kilometres across and about half that in depth. This is very curious, Captain. It computes as a strange combination of matter and energy. No, Lieutenant, the cloud has engulfed Alondra. Captain, the planet seems to be breaking up. Its mass is definitely growing smaller. It seems a logical assumption, Captain. Perhaps more, Doctor. If planet annihilation is part of this thing's nature, it might seek them out as instinctively as an amoeba seeks out food. It may not consume only planets, but also stars. We do not know yet whether it has any selective ability, but it could be a thread to every planet in our galaxy. On the other hand, notifying them may still save some small fraction of the population, Captain. Captain, I'm getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors. Elements unknown in our periodic tables, Captain. I'm of the opinion this cloud has come from outside our galaxy. The streamers are a combination of koinoenergy, almost an ambiplasma with an unusually powerful attraction force. The cloud appeared to absorb the phaser energy, Captain. The objects are some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter. Only the beginning of a theory, Captain. It is possible this cloud in which we are entrapped is a living thing. The cloud is alive. Yes, Captain, its components appear similar to those found in living organisms. I am inclined to agree with the Doctor, Captain. The mass of the planet Alondra has been steadily growing smaller since we've been in here. If we assume the cloud is a living being, we must also assume it needs some kind of food to sustain itself. Exactly. It is like a huge bull grazing here and there in the pasture of the universe. Captain, those villi are antimatter. It the Enterprise touches one of them The cloud is now only forty two minutes, fourteen seconds from Mantilles, Captain. And we have ascertained an important fact. This being does have a brain. Impossible to say at this moment, Captain. It has made only one action which might be interpreted as intelligent. It changed course from Alondra toward Mantilles. But that could have been an involuntary response to the sensing of food. That irregularly shaped object at the top of the core emanates considerable electrical activity. Captain, this is a living creature. Starfleet regulations Captain, I have completed the analysis of the target area. Unfortunately, the brain is so vast, our entire offensive armament will not assure its destruction. However, the brain could be completely destroyed if we convert the entire ship to energy, aimed at the brain's cortex, and expend the energy in one mortal strike. I believe that is what I just said, Doctor. Yes, Captain. Quite sure. It would require physical contact, which is impossible, Captain. But I may be able to reach out with my mind. If we focus our sensors onto the cloud's synaptic electrical impulses, the input could be routed to the ship's computer for analysis into thought. It is impossible to calculate, Captain. There are too many unknown factors. I can only try to accomplish the link. No more. Ready, Captain. Listen to me. Listen to me. You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. Listen to me. I am another being. I am inside you. I am very small. And there are many of me. We are in a spaceship within you. A small thing which holds us all. Within you. We came to think to you. You consumed us. You thought we were food. Many of us live on the things you consume. Yes. Many of us are on the thing near you now. Do not consume it. The spherical thing ahead of you, the matter you intend to consume, sense it closely. They are beings. Alive, like you. They will all die if you consume that thing. Explain. Listen to me. I'm going to come into your thoughts. And at the same time, you will come into mine. Yes. Very. There are many things in our galaxy like the one you just perceived. Truth. You do not desire to consume other beings. It would be best if you return to your origin. The way you came. Will you do this? Will you return? I believe so, Captain. There is a grid at the top of the brain core. It uses it to sense. We can escape the cloud through it. The wonders of the universe, Captain. Incredible, completely incredible. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Probes and sensors indicate there was once a vast civilisation here. Lovely. Lovely. However, life readings are sparse and concentrated. Captain Kirk is beaming down with a scouting party to investigate. I dream of ... the gala lads ... can I trow Very thoughtful of you, love. Their patterns'll break up, scatter in space. Transporter reprogrammed, Mister Spock."
63,TAS,episode 3,KIRK,"Twenty seconds to what? That's what worries me. Lieutenant Uhura, place the ship on Yellow Alert. Put it on ship's speaker. From where? Can you trace it? Can you identify it? That's a powerful signal to reach here from that great a distance. Strange. Yes, I get the same feeling myself. Opinion noted. Set a course for the Taurean system, Lieutenant Arex. Warp factor seven. So am I. Dimensional visions. Any idea what's causing them, Spock? Miss Chapel, you don't see anything, either? Take a medical reading, Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura, call Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. Re-scan your sensor readings, Mister Spock. Fantastic architecture. Only an incredibly advanced race could have built it. No, I don't think so, Carver. Spock will do it. Yes, I feel it too, Bones. There's no apparent danger, Spock. Let's go. How do you know our names? The signal? A distress call, wasn't it? That makes sense. Spock Yes. Duties. That's it. Duties. I have We must go. They've gone. Go ahead. Locked. The urn. It's the only place. The headbands. Look at them. You mean they're actually draining our life forces? How long do we have, Spock? And useless to them. Theela said the other men of the crew would join us here. They'll be lured into the same trap. We've got to contact the ship. We've got to get out of here. Spock. Can the transporter be programmed to re-pattern us as we were? Beam us up, Scotty. Did it work?"
64,TAS,episode 3,SPOCK,"If my calculations are correct, Captain, we have twenty seconds to go. Five seconds. Four, three Captain, we are being probed. The signal is coming from a star system twenty light years away. It is the Taurean system. A small star at the extreme edge of this sector. It does resemble a summons. Fascinating. Like a Vulcan marriage drum. I am experiencing audio-visual suggestion, Captain. Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe. Readings are still inconclusive. It is odd that only the men are affected, Captain. I suggest Captain, the urgency of our feeling suggests visual compulsion. I advise remaining at a distance until I can determine the extent of its influence. The life forms are indicated in its centre. The form is humanoid, but there are many internal differences. Their bodies appear to function on an unusual psychokinesis level. Tonal control. Fascinating. We must return to our duties aboard ship. Yes. Your medikit, Doctor. It may contain something which will help us. Perhaps they saw no practical use in it. If the lock is magnetised, this may disrupt its field. I have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not present. They could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital energy to the bodies of the women. That would account for our rapid aging, Captain. And our weakness. If you recall, the women seemed listless at first. But as our strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital. We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain. I have retained more strength than any of you. My internal structure is different, Captain, my life span longer. It is wiser if I go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the ship. The equipment belonging to the men of the Enterprise, where is it? Spock to Enterprise. Request rescue party. All-female. Repeat. All-female. All Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant Uhura commanding. We have assembled an all-female rescue party in # accordance with Mister Spock's request. Miss Chapel. Miss Chapel. Christine. Perhaps the transporter is the key. Our restoration. It holds the molecular pattern of our original bodies when we beamed down to the planet. Possibly. But the odds against us are ninety nine point seven to one. We are on the surface, Mister Scott. Reprogram the transporter as previously directed."
65,TAS,episode 3,UHURA,"Aye, sir. Yellow Alert. All stations report Yellow Alert status, sir. Captain, I'm getting some sort of subspace radio signal. It's more like music than a message. I find no resemblance to a summons, Captain. I am. But I want you to observe the men here. It seemed to start when we picked up that signal, and it's gotten worse. Sir, what visions? We don't see anything. Sickbay, Doctor McCoy. Please report to the Bridge. Doctor McCoy? No response. The signal's getting stronger, sir. These figures just don't match up with Spock's. So far I count three sensor readings that are off. Lieutenant Uhura to Security Officer Davison. I want an all-woman security team on every transporter immediately. No one is to transport down to the planet unless it is on my order. Taking command of this ship. Mister Scott, as senior Lieutenant, I'm taking responsibility for the safety of this ship.

That looks like a pool or a tub. Phasers on setting one. Fire. Scotty, we're losing them! You're more handsome than ever. A crew of women will bring a ship back.

Greetings. I am Theela. Head Female of this compound. Return to your ship. You are not wanted here. Wait! I will tell you everything. The past. Reveal it. This is the race from whom we are descended. They came to this planet when our homeworld began to die. They built this place and all surrounding it. They did not know this planet drains humanoid energy. But the women's bodies developed a glandular secretion, enabling them to survive and to manipulate certain areas of the males' brains, influence their emotional senses. Ultimately, it drained the men, caused them to weaken and die. To survive, we must vitalise each twenty seven years of your time. We shall see. The men of the Enterprise, reveal them. The nearest water accumulation is many cusecs from here. It is the urn in the garden. Tell Captain Kirk we have kept the agreement. How quickly will we become as other women? A life of hope.

Tribbles don't like Klingons. That should have given you some clue. According to our computer files, Jones, you are in violation of three Federation mandates and forty seven local ones. You're confined until we complete our mission. Then we'll turn you over to the proper authorities. Not about tribbles, anyway. I am concerned about that new Klingon weapon. The practical advantages of such a weapon would seem to be limited. Yes. Status report on the damaged grain ship, Scotty? Nor do I, Mister Scott, but we've got to do it. Sherman's Planet needs that grain desperately. Deflector shields up. Stand by phasers. How fat do these things get? Use the robot ship as a decoy. Have it change course and move off. We'll use it again to give the Klingons trouble. They can't control more than one ship at a time with their stasis field. Ready phasers. Photon torpedoes. Fire one. Perhaps they haven't had enough time to recharge it. Scotty, put a tractor beam on it. We'll take it in tow. That seems logical. Well, Mister Spock, do you have any ideas? I thought Vulcans didn't have a sense of humour. Get Cyrano Jones up here. Any sign of Captain Koloth's ship? Keep scanning. Your tribbles are all over my ship. My security men can't find them all. Mister Jones, you are in enough trouble already. Harmless, maybe. Little? In any case, they're eating the quintrotriticale. The wheat! So are the people on Sherman's Planet.

The Klingon ship under command of Captain Koloth is forcing us into a battle for custody of Cyrano Jones for reasons still unknown. Ready photon torpedoes. Fire one. Not if I can help it.

And that's all you want? Oh, well, if that's all. Mister Scott, transport the glommer over to the Klingon ship. Well, at least we can report the stasis field is not as effective a weapon as we thought. The power drain is too high and takes too long for the Klingon ship to recover to make it practical. Say, you didn't get this one, Bones. But it hasn't Someday I'll learn."
96,TAS,episode 4,SPOCK,"Sensors indicate the smaller vessel is a one-man scout ship of common design. Some kind of field effect, Captain. It will hit us in precisely four seconds. It produces a most remarkable disruption. Captain, we have been hit by a kind of projected stasis field. Our matter-antimatter generators are disabled. We are paralysed. The photon torpedoes will not respond, either. The stasis field disables all higher-order field and warp functions. This new Klingon weapon must be one of surprising power if it can immobilize a starship. The energy drain on the Klingon ship would be enormous. Captain, you can't afford to lose that grain. Incredible. The amount of energy that field must require. They couldn't maintain the stasis field. Apparently their battle capacity is down. They only damaged it. Sensors indicate their power cells are almost exhausted. They probably don't have the strength for a prolonged battle now. It appears to be A safe tribble would be a contradiction in terms. Tribbles are well known for their proclivities in multiplication. That may be true, but they rarely enter Federation space and fire on Federation vessels without reason. It is an energy-sapping field of great strength, Captain. It immobilizes a starship and its weapons capability. But apparently, it also immobilizes the attacking ship's abilities at the same time. I believe I just said that, Mister Scott. Perhaps, but there are logical applications. The key question is, how long does it take them to recharge? They will probably attack us again as soon as they are back up to power. And they will probably begin by destroying the other robot ship to prevent us from repeating the same trick. They want Cyrano Jones very badly. Captain, sensors are picking up a Klingon battle cruiser. Obviously, they can recharge their power in a matter of hours. The Klingon seems to be veering off. My mistake, Captain. They were not veering off. They were attacking the grain ship. Captain Koloth is quite a marksman. They're running away. Very odd. They did not use their stasis weapon at all. Or the purpose of the attack was something else. Captain, that could be exactly what they want us to do. Tow the robot and limit our available power. We're carrying the extra mass of the first ship's cargo, and now we have the second one in tow. That requires a great deal of power we won't be able to use in battle. Thank you. We could always throw tribbles at them. We don't, Captain. Contact in thirty seconds. Aren't you going to sit down, sir? Agreed, Captain. Tribbles appear to be a much more effective weapon."
97,TAS,episode 4,UHURA,"Well, we could always throw rocks. Captain, I have a message coming in, sir. Mister Spock, I'm losing contact with our robot ships. They're not held by the stasis field and they're moving out of range. Yes, sir. The robot ships, they're moving off. Message coming in, sir. With pleasure, sir."

121,TAS,episode 4,KOLOTH,"Ah, Captain Kirk. I'd be delighted to, Captain Kirk, if you will turn over the pilot of the little ship. He has committed ecological sabotage. If I have to take him by force, I will. I'm afraid, Captain Kirk, you'll find your phasers no longer work, nor any of your weapons. You're going to give me one chance? It won't work, Captain Kirk. Ah, Captain Kirk. We'll take control of your ship now. I want your prisoner. It is not a request. Don't force me to take steps that we will both regret. Implement boarding plan C. Release your ship? Kirk, you are monotonous. Know what? I doubt that. Our instruments report nothing except some undue transporter activity and Kirk? Tribbles? Kirk, Cyrano Jones took a Klingon genetic construct, an artificial creature from one of our planets. We must have it back. It was designed to be a tribble predator. We are prepared to go to war if we have to. This was the first one, Kirk. We need it in order to grow others from it. We need it to get rid of the tribbles Jones sold before they completely overrun the planet. Jones is not that important. We must have the glommer. Well, we can do something about that. Attack. He did it to us again! That tin-plated, overbearing excuse for a starship captain did it to us again. Blast that thing. Yes. Don't do that again. Ever."
122,TAS,episode 4,JONES,"Captain Kirk. Friend Kirk. Captain, these are safe tribbles. And they breed fast, too. And that's why these tribbles are safe. They don't reproduce. I've had them genetically engineered for compatibility with humanoid ecologies. See how friendly and loveable they are? And not a baby in the bunch. They're great pets and profitable, too. Oh, well, I managed a short parole. I found some help. This is a tribble predator. It's called a glommer. Watch. How should I know? Klingons have notoriously bad tempers. Me? A saboteur? Ridiculous. It was such a little thing. I can't understand at all why they got upset. I only sold them some tribbles. Well, I didn't know it was a Klingon planet. Klingons like tribbles even less. It was lucky you came along and saved me when you did, Friend Kirk. I couldn't have outrun them much longer. Captain, couldn't we talk this over? I didn't think so. Captain Kirk, what can I do for you? Some Spican flame gems perhaps? You need better security men, Captain. Captain, a harmless little tribble. What can they hurt? The what? They're hungry, Captain. You can't do this to me. Under space salvage laws, he's mine. I withdraw my claim. Er, what about the Klingons?"
123,TAS,episode 4,KORAX,"Yes, sir. Captain, the engine room is filled with tribble. Any other orders, sir?"
124,TAS,episode 5,MCCOY,"That's impossible, Spock. Carter Winston's been missing over five years. Incredible. It is him. I'm especially honoured to meet you, Mister Winston. My daughter was going to school on Cerberus about ten years ago when the crop failure occurred. The entire population would've starved, Jim, if Winston here hadn't used his personal fortune to bring in enough food and goods to carry them through the crisis. Spock! Of all the cold-blooded, inhospitable requests I've ever heard. This instrument seems a little off. I've never gotten quite this reading from a human before. Of course not. Anyway, it's just a fraction off normal. It's probably the instrument. They need to be recalibrated every so often. Yes, I suppose so. Well, I certainly don't want to keep you any longer from your fiancee. Show her in. Well, some are off and some aren't. It has to be our error. Come on. We'll start from the beginning and this time we're going to find the answer. Oh, Winston. I was just finishing the tests I ran on you. I don't think Can I help you? Oh now, let me guess. It's you and Carter Winston. He told me a little about it when I examined him. Well, I'm sure he'd like to feel the same way about you, Anne, but that may be impossible. Five years, that's a long time. People change. Well, if he asked you to forget him, I think you should try to do just that. Do you think he'd want to deceive you? Yes, but, my dear, if he doesn't want you and he has asked you to forget him, then I suggest you take that as an honest concern for you and do it. Forget Winston. What can I do for you, Captain? I'm afraid I'll have to make it later today, Captain. I have too many tests to process right now. That one's done. Tested out normal. Well, there's always that possibility. I'll go over them again if you like. I must have taken a little nap. Did you say I'm a man of curious habits? Jim's talking to a table. I saw that, but I don't believe it. Jim! You caught him. I'm glad to see him under guard, Jim. If he'd turned into a second Spock, it would've been too much to take."

126,TAS,episode 5,SULU,"Weren't you going to your cabin, sir? Through the Romulan Neutral Zone, sir? But sir, if we're caught there, the Romulans can confiscate the ship. The treaty Aye, aye, sir. Course laid in, sir. On course, sir. Weren't you going to your cabin, sir? Through the Romulan Neutral Zone, sir? Captain, our deflector shields are coming down. Hangar doors on the shuttlecraft deck are opening, sir. The Vendorian must be trying to escape. Doors closing, sir. Captain, the deflector shields are coming up again. Yes, sir, but it is between us and the Romulans. Phasers and torpedoes ready, sir. Ready, Captain."
127,TAS,episode 5,KYLE,
128,TAS,episode 5,ALIEN,"I assume the danger to your ship is over. As it should be. I'm sorry if I endangered your vessel. Among my own people, I am a non-producer, useless. An outcast fit only to do those tasks of the lowest order. The Romulans offered me a life, something of value I could do. It is important to be of value to someone. It seems, Captain, that I am more Carter Winston than I knew. He loved life. He loved Anne. I couldn't allow the Romulans to harm any of you because of him. What will happen to me now? Thank you, Captain."
129,TAS,episode 5,SCOTT,"Two Romulan battle cruisers, Captain. And they're heading right for us. Captain's log, supplemental. Due to interference by the alien Vendorian aboard, the Enterprise has been detected violating the Romulan Neutral Zone. By the terms of our treaty, the Romulans have a legal right to seize and impound the Enterprise. To complicate matters, we have not been able to apprehend the Vendorian responsible for putting us in this position. What are you doing? I don't know, sir. I came up here to check the backup systems, and there was a crewman taking this panel apart. That's all I remember. Two hours, at least. But sir, I haven't finished repairing the shield. I told you it'll take hours, and it will. Will someone tell me what's going on? What manner of beastie is that?"
130,TAS,episode 5,KIRK,"Have you identified the vessel, Mister Spock? Carter Winston. There are few in the Federation who wouldn't recognise your face, sir. I'm Captain James Kirk, commanding this vessel. Mister Spock, my first officer, Doctor McCoy, senior medical officer. One of the many stories I've heard about you, Mister Winston. It's an honour for all of us to have you aboard. Spock is right as usual, Bones. Visual display of owner. Checks out. It seems we'll have a distinguished passenger with us for a while. Take the conn, Mister Spock. I'll be in my cabin completing the report on Winston's rescue. Come. No, please come in, Mister Winston. Yes, I'm afraid it's pretty badly damaged. It's hardly worth salvaging right now. I've had our engineering officer, Mister Scott, examine it and make a report. It's here somewhere. He doesn't think there's anything left in your ship except scrap value. Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three. That was the order, helmsman. I know the terms of the treaty, Mister Sulu, and I believe you heard my order. Mister Spock, I've spoken to Winston on this at some length. He has assured me it is absolutely vital to get to Ratar Three in the shortest possible time. The survival of the entire planetary population may depend on it. I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't feel it safe, Spock. Winston says his sensors detected no Romulans when he came through the Zone last week. I'm satisfied he's telling the truth, and his word is considered good. Isn't it? Execute. You have the conn, Mister Spock. Ship's log, stardate 5148.7. First Officer Spock recording. The Captain's course change has taken us deep into the Romulan Neutral Zone. I'll take the conn, Mister Spock. I'm not sure. I went down to my quarters to dictate the accident report and I seem to have fallen asleep. I've never done that before. The Neutral Zone? We have no authorisation to enter it. Did you order a course change, Spock? Ridiculous. No captain of the Starfleet would do that unless it was a matter of life and death. Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three. That was an order, helmsman. That's enough, Spock. Mister Scott, take the conn. Spock. Mister Sulu, plot a course to take the Enterprise out of the Neutral Zone at warp eight. Lieutenant M'Ress, put the ship on Yellow Alert. Mister Spock, I don't remember giving those orders. I left the Bridge, went to my quarters and fell asleep. That's all. Definitely. I've become subject to blackouts, I'm a possible danger to the safety of the ship. I can't allow that. I want a complete medical examination, Bones. Something's just happened No, that won't be necessary. I'll come by later for that examination. Let's go, Spock. He said there's always that possibility. And that's not like Bones at all. Come on. There's something wrong about this room. All right, Winston. You can come out now. I suggest you show yourself, Winston, or whatever you are. There used to be only two examining tables in this room. Now there are three. This is a vial of Orientine acid, Winston. It will burn through almost anything but this crystal. If you've never seen it work, I'll demonstrate on you. Mister Spock, get a security team down here on the double. Lieutenant Nored, you could've stopped him. Why didn't you fire? Lieutenant, he is not the man you loved. Carter Winston is dead. I was afraid of that. Once out of our sight, he can become anyone or anything aboard this ship. Bridge, this is the Captain. What's happened? It was not deliberate, I assure you. I'd like a few minutes to inform my crew. Kirk to Security. What's the status on the search for the Vendorian? Carry on, Lieutenant. The Romulans were expecting us, Mister Spock. That wreck of Winston's ship was the bait to get a Romulan spy onboard. And what better spy than a Vendorian who can shape at will. When I went down to my cabin, he must have put me out long enough for him to return to the Bridge and order the course change. Open a hailing frequency Lieutenant M'Ress. Wrong assumption. I have no choice, Commander. You lured me here in direct violation of the treaty. Through the use of a spy using the human form of Carter Winston. You used a Vendorian, which, I might add, is also a violation of the treaty. I will not surrender my ship. Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, what's happened to the shields? Get those shields Up again now. We need him. Override the controls and shut those doors. Spock, take the conn. Talk to the Romulans. Try to stall them. And send a security team to the hangar deck. I'll be in Engineering. KIRK; What happened? How long will it take to fix? Get on it. But unfortunately, I can't. Without deflectors, we're just a clay pigeon for them. That's only one shield. Mister Sulu, aim for the propulsion units of the lead Romulan vessel. Prepare to fire phasers and photon torpedoes in combination. Fire. Lock on second target. Fire. They may believe we do have their spy. Scan the other vessel for damage, if you will, Mister Spock. Good work, Mister Scott. That deflector shield went up just in time. Then what was? Winston. It is. Why did you do it? What changed your mind about the Romulans? I understand. You'll have to stand trial. But you did save the Enterprise from the Romulans, and I will recommend that be taken into consideration. In the meantime, I'm afraid I'll have to keep you under guard. I think we've had enough of that little trick. You have the guard detail, Lieutenant."
131,TAS,episode 5,SPOCK,"Yes Captain, but you may find it difficult to believe. The vessel is registered to Carter Winston. There is one person aboard who should be especially happy to learn you are alive, Mister Winston. Lieutenant Anne Nored of our security detail. We will notify her as soon as we've verified your credentials, Mister Winston. If you have your identity tapes with you I believe our regulations are quite clear, Doctor. An immediate identity check and medical examination are a standard requirement at this point. Library computer, verify record tape on Winston, Carter. Captain, the extreme long-range sensors show something in the Zone. At this distance, I cannot determine precisely what it is. It could be a trading vessel like Winston's. But it does not seem prudent to take the risk of trespass into the Zone. An admirable mission, Captain, but if we endanger our ship That has been his reputation. Is something wrong, Captain? Perhaps you needed the rest. We are on course through the Neutral Zone, sir. No, sir. You did. I believe that was the reason you gave, Captain. Perhaps Doctor McCoy should examine you, Captain. Carter Winston's? Are you sure there is no possibility you made an error? Captain, did you notice Doctor McCoy's reaction when I asked him if there was any possibility he might have made an error? There are not many places one could hide in here. Doctor, you are a man of curious habits, but I have never known you to nap on the laboratory floor. I don't think so, Doctor. I just realised that. A Vendorian, Doctor. Their planet is quarantined, and few people ever do see them. Their ability to rearrange their molecular structure into anything with the same general size and mass and their practise of deceit as a way of life puts them off limits. Spock to Bridge. Put me on ship's audio. All security teams, intruder alert. Repeat, intruder alert. The intruder is a Vendorian capable of assuming any shape or identity. Security teams report no sign of the alien on this deck, Captain. It would seem so. Direct hit, Captain. Damage to the secondary propulsion system. The commander has apparently decided to fight. Practicality does suggest capitulation, Captain. Second vessel firing now, sir. Strange. We did no damage, but the Romulan is retreating anyway. Second vessel power supply out. Crew unharmed. They should be able to repair the ship in a few days. Interesting. It is not outside the realm of probability. If he could rearrange his own atoms to become an examination table, one would have to assume he could become a deflector shield. Your deflector shield, Mister Scott. Acute observation, Doctor. Perhaps. But then two Doctor McCoys just might bring the level of medical efficiency on this ship up to acceptable levels. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

I don't know, Doctor. I just thought. Well, I have to talk to someone. Doctor, what do I do? I still love him. I haven't. What can I do? Oh no. He's the gentlest, most thoughtful man I've ever known. Thank you, Doctor. I'll consider your advice. My job. It isn't hard to guess who the intruder is. You're the only stranger aboard, Carter. I, I couldn't. I knew he had to be the intruder, Captain, but I couldn't harm the image of the man I loved. I know that too, now. No progress yet. We have all decks patrolled, but no one has seen him. You're not getting past me this time. I've learned my lesson. Carter? What did he say? How did he die? You are so much like him, his voice, his mannerisms. He did say he loved me. Carter. Captain, could you assign me that duty. Form doesn't seem terribly important to me. As Carter Winston or even just part of him, there's a better life for you than anything the Romulans might offer. Can we talk about that?"
160,TAS,episode 5,ROMULAN,"You appear to have a propensity for trespassing in the Neutral Zone, Captain Kirk. It never is. But the rules of the treaty are clear. To contravene them would mean war. You will surrender your ship, Captain. We will release you and your crew at the nearest outpost that guards the Neutral Zone. Very well. Five minutes, no more. I assume you are now ready to turn your ship over to us, Captain. Captain, you are outnumbered, outgunned and in the wrong. I admire your courage, but I Lured, Captain? How could we lure a Starfleet vessel into the Neutral Zone? A spy? Come now, Captain. Your imagination is creative but obviously out of control. Your five minutes are up, Captain. Either surrender your ship or prepare to fight. Captain Kirk, all our main batteries are trained on you. To resist would be useless and wasteful of lives. Do you surrender?"

The Enterprise has rescued a living legend, the foremost space trader of our time. Carter Winston has acquired a dozen fortunes only to use his wealth time and again to assist Federation colonies in times of need or disaster. Is there some problem, Doctor? Are you suggesting I'm not quite human, Doctor? I'm sorry, Anne. I never thought we would meet again. When I left on that last trip, I fully intended to come back and marry you, but my ship was disabled and I crashed on Vendor. I'm told I was lucky I survived. Anne, I'm changed. First there was surgery, skin graft, regrowth of bone. After they put me together, they assigned one of their people to me, and he nursed me back to health. It's over between us, Anne. I'm sorry, I can't explain why but, I can't marry you. Ever. I hope I'm not intruding, Captain. I've been down to examine my ship. They stowed it in the shuttlebay. Anne, what are you doing? Yes. He said you were like that, practical as well as warm and lovely. You're everything he said you were. Many things. Some were only feelings, deep feelings he couldn't always express. He did love you. Winston crashed on our planet, and he was tended by a Vendorian. Me. He lived for almost a year before his body ceased to function. That is the way of our people. The longer we stay in another's form, the more we take on its memory, emotion, attitudes. Not totally, but a great deal as time passes. As I do. In a sense, I feel some of the emotions he felt. His love for you was very strong. Because I was there, it did not end when he died. Anne, this is what I am. Can you love this? You see why I told you it would be best to forget me? But you've seem me. You know what I am. I don't know. I"

164,TAS,episode 6,MCCOY,"Jim, I'm picking up a humanoid reading of incredible strength. It's as if he He's been poisoned. Unknown toxin. I can't get a correlation with any known poison. He's got about one minute to live unless I can find an answer. Maybe dylovene. No good. Takes too much time to work if it does work. Now, just a minute. I can't let you, whatever you are, inject him with some alien dew drop! Intelligent plants? Minor? Our science doesn't have anything that works that fast. Yours must be incredible. The toxin level is decreasing fast. Body readings up to normal. How is it you knew your antidote would work on a human? There are evidences of gram-positive bacteria. It's carried by humanoids without ill effect, but staphylococcus strains don't seem to be native to this planet. It must have been like a plague. I think it's after you, Jim. Captain! No, definitely human, Jim. One of my great great granddaddies, way back, had the finest garden in the South. Had to scramble around a little bit to find the materials, but I've got his recipe brewing now. There used to be a story about a modern Diogenes wandering the galaxy looking for someone special. It couldn't be Keniclius. He'd be over two hundred and fifty years old. I'm not sure I can take too much of this. Looks like they're getting ready to go on a trip. Sure they are, now. But what about before? The ships look like they never got off the ground. Could be the disease Keniclius accidentally brought here swept the planet before they could do whatever they were going to do. What if something happens to Spock or the Master? What? Jim, up ahead. He's dying. Something's happened to his brain. Electrical activity decreasing. Mine too, Jim. Maybe they're waiting for the mist to clear. Well, how about that. Great granddaddy's weed spray still works. It's no use, Jim. He'll be dead in a few minutes. His mind is gone. He no longer thinks. This machine has drained his mind somehow. I don't think he understands. His mind is still trying to assimilate all the knowledge it's been fed. He's coming out of it, Jim. He's becoming conscious and aware. Spock is slipping away. There isn't much time left. I can understand why you think Keniclius is the master if he saved you from dying, but why do you agree with his plan of a super race? Jim, Spock's almost gone."

166,TAS,episode 6,SULU,"Life readings are confused, sir. I can't decipher them. Well, now. What's this? Captain! Captain! You're going to have to see this yourself, sir. It's a mobile plant. When it stops, it's roots bore back into the ground. They're all over the place. I think it likes me. Ow! Must have been a thorn. Argh! They won't work on any setting, sir. What do you think they'll do with us, sir? We haven't been able to pick up any human life form readings, sir. Spock and Keniclius must be somewhere our sensors can't penetrate. I had to adjust for the fact that they're plant life forms. We're registering the lesser ones like the Swoopers in abundance. No sign of Agmar and the other four. Aye, sir. Phasers locked on and ready, sir. Firing. No effect, Captain. Phaser stun was neutralized at a distance of one thousand metres above the area. I'd hate to resort to clubs and knives. I hope these things work. No indication of a scan. I don't think they know we're here. They're almost mindless, Doctor. They seem to attack primarily as a reflex action. It's clear now. I can't believe it. Agmar said they were a peaceful people. No, sir. Only the Phylosians. Just like that, Captain? No wonder we couldn't find Spock. The walls are six hundred times denser than lead, in addition to the surface force field. Use the belt lights! Captain, I'm out. The chemical sprayer is empty. The Vulcan mind touch. I don't know, sir. It isn't just physical, you know. You have to be inscrutable."

A strange way to handle aliens. Aye, sir, but I don't like it. Keep trying, Lieutenant. We've got to make contact with the Captain. Except for environmental systems, I want the entire power load of this ship redirected into a tight beam transmission. If we can break through the shielding, we can reach the Captain. And don't I know it, lass. But we must speak to the Captain. Then throw the switch, Lieutenant. Keep trying. Keep trying. G Let's hope it was information they could use."
170,TAS,episode 6,KIRK,"What is it, Mister Sulu? What is that thing? We always encourage our officers to make friends with the natives. Phasers on stun. Stay alert. Mister Sulu, stay here. Can you help him? Maybe the ship's medical computers. Maybe a stronger shot. Who are you? Are you getting a reading on them? Bones, let them help. Thank you. I'm Captain James Kirk. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy and Mister Sulu. You seem to have been expecting us. What happened to him? Your medication worked quickly. I'm sorry, Agmar, but I don't like puzzles. Where are the rest of your people? Your ancestors? Then, what happened? You were alive then? Kirk to Enterprise. Something tells me we've just been used as a diversionary tactic. Look. What are you talking about? Where have they taken Spock? So help me, if you don't tell me where Spock has been taken Another plant? Where is Spock? Not without my First Officer. Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up, Scotty. Captain's log, stardate 5554.8. We have come upon one of the most fascinating discoveries we have ever seen. Plant life of extraordinary intelligence and technology. However, they have captured Mister Spock, apparently under the orders of a human named Keniclius. Lieutenant Uhura is trying to locate any reference to such a man in order to unravel the mystery of this giant human. Anything, Mister Sulu? What about the Phylosians? Agmar said something about a weapons deactivator. Mister Sulu, lock ship's phasers on that laboratory building. Use a wide area stun setting. Lieutenant Uhura, how are you coming with that information on Keniclius? Keep trying, Lieutenant. Fire phasers. Which means our weapons are useless, and we have no alternative but to go back down there and try to rescue Spock without them. There may be something more effective, Mister Sulu. Kirk to Engineering. Scotty? How's that special equipment coming along? Very well, Mister Scott. Kirk out. Thank you, Lieutenant. Bones? Someone special. A perfect specimen, perhaps. Yes, I've heard it too. Not if he cloned a new copy of himself every so often to carry on the search. Remember, he said he was Keniclius Five. It seems incredible that a man could take a few cells from his body and reproduce himself from them time after time. But that seems to be exactly what we're dealing with in the giant human Keniclius. These are strange aliens we're fighting. Scotty, as soon as we beam down, I want you to leave orbit. If they think we've gone, they won't be scanning the surface. Give us thirty minutes. Neither do I, but it appears to be necessary. Energise. Let's go. Incredible. But where? To what purpose? The number of ships indicates a mass migration. Or invasion. You could have a point, Bones. Those ships, the city. The Phylosians built a technology possibly greater than we animal species did. Any indication of Keniclius or Spock? Well, followers can be led. Let's hope we can be as persuasive as Keniclius. Agmar, we don't want to hurt you, but we must have Spock back. Carry on your work? So it would appear, Mister Sulu. All the same, keep that bag handy. Did you hear something? I'm not sure. There it is again. A flapping sound. Agmar! They don't operate. Agmar! Run. We've got to find some light. We can't do anything unless we can see what we're fighting. Don't stop. Try to stay together. I see it. I see it. Keep going. Get ready. Wait, listen. Never mind that. We've got to get Spock out of here before Keniclius returns. Scott should have the Enterprise back by now. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Nothing. Must be these blasted walls again. Kirk to Enterprise. You talk about creating life with your clones, but you have to murder to do it. Come on. Out of my way, mister. That's an order. Spock, what is the logic in letting a man die for the sake of creating his duplicate? Explain it to me, sir. Explain it to me. Vulcans do not condone the meaningless death of any being. Spock's death is meaningless if it is only to create a giant version of himself. That's our ship calling, Spock. You answer them. All this has been a waste, Keniclius. There's been peace in the Federation for over one hundred years. You're the fifth Keniclius. What makes you so sure what you believe is truth isn't just old news? Your predecessors could have been out of touch with our advances for two centuries. We already have peace in the Federation. It wasn't imposed, it was agreed upon. You have no need of Spock. Reverse the effects of that machine and let us take him. If you have Spock's mind, you'll know the Vulcan symbol called the IDIC. G Could an army of Spocks impose peace and Phylosian philosophy on any other beings in defiance of the concept? G Reverse the machine, Keniclius. Murderer! You've killed Spock! G Spock. Spock, you old G How does that sound to you, Keniclius? To bring life is at least as important as bringing peace. I'll report your work here. I think the Federation will understand. By the way, Mister Sulu, any chance of teaching me that body throw? Could come in handy sometime. Inscrutable? Sulu, you're the most scrutable man I know. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

We are being scanned. The probe originates in this wall, as does an incredibly powerful force shield. It appears to be an amalgam of devices designed to defend and protect the city and this building in particular. A moment, Captain. The results are unclear. Captain, these beings are of botanical origin. So it would seem. Your method of communication Nerve tissue. Mass density is exceptionally high. Readings indicate the beings used almost seventy percent of their brains. A very high ratio. Plant life, Captain. Primitive and aggressive. Commander Spock here. Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. Symbolising the elements that create truth and beauty. I do not believe so. To persist in this behaviour, Captain, is to negate the eloquence of your previous argument. May I suggest a more constructive way? G My mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts. I am pleasantly surprised at your capacity for deductive reasoning, Captain. When you are not being bellicose, there appears to be no end to your arsenal of formidable talents. And you needn't worry, Captain Kirk, about a master race. There will be no militia, no other Spocks. I would suggest Doctor Keniclius remain on Phylos with my duplicate. The concerted efforts of both scientists may yet achieve a rebirth of the Phylosian civilisation and enable them to contribute to the Federation. G My thoughts exactly, Mister Spock. So one might assume, Mister Spock."

It's no use, Mister Scott. I can't get through. Mister Scott, you're risking a total drain of our dilithium crystals. To maintain communication we would have to burn out all our reserves. All power sources locked in, Mister Scott. I'm sure we're getting through, but they're not acknowledging. Mister Scott, we're near the drain point on the dilithium crystals now. Our reserves Oh, thank heaven. Mister Spock, tell the Captain I've located more information about Keniclius. I had the library computer check out all known writings by Keniclius. They are obscure, but there is a recurring theme in his later essays about using his master race as a peace-keeping force throughout the galaxy. That was why Keniclius wanted a perfect specimen. I have to sign off. We've reached power drain threshold. That's what I call close, Mister Scott."

Go back to your ship. I am sorry, Captain. You will leave now or suffer the consequences. It's too late, Captain Kirk! In a few minutes your friend will be gone. But as Keniclius One lives on in each of his clones, so will Mister Spock. Behold, gentlemen, the dawning of a new era, the salvation of a galaxy! Spock Two! More than just drained. It's been transferred, relocated into the mechanism itself. I can duplicate exact physiological structure. I cannot duplicate that which is learned. Just as my predecessor transferred his knowledge to me through his apparatus, I have done that with Mister Spock and the first of his clones. It is not just a duplicate. He will be the beginning of a master race. He That is a lie. What about the Eugenics Wars? The galactic wars? What of the depredations of the Romulans, the Klingons and the Kzinti? An army of Spock duplicates is necessary to subdue them. No! The mould must be broken. But what of my work? If all I have lived for is already done, if the times I feared are gone, what is to become of me? There appears to be no reason why I should continue to exist. I would be honoured. If I will be allowed."
206,TAS,episode 6,AGMAR,"That won't be necessary. I am called Agmar. I believe we can help. To wait is to assure your friend's death. I must proceed. It is an antidote quickly absorbed. He should begin to respond momentarily. Welcome to the planet Phylos. Our instruments have tracked and scanned you. We did not wish to reveal ourselves immediately. We are a peaceful race and we have a fear of aliens. He was bitten by the Retlaw plant. It is deadly only if unattended. A minor achievement. There have been humanoid aliens here before. A voder, or translator. Most efficient. Come. I will show you. Our people. No, only the generation before us. A human came. He brought sickness and death. But he also worked to save us from his disease. We had no way of knowing what was happening. Very young. There is a weapons deactivator in effect here. Your destructive machines will have no effect. I'm sorry, Captain Kirk, but there was no other way. He has been chosen to serve a greater cause. The Master has searched many years to find a specimen like Spock. And now, all the worlds of the galaxy will share in the beauty of peace and harmony. I do not think that is possible. The Vulcan-human blend of wisdom, sense of order, durability and strength is the finest the Master has ever found. We are pleased Spock will carry on our work. We are the last of a dying people, Captain. Once we had a great mission. Then disease decimated us. We few are the frail remnant of what survived. Our spore cells have been destroyed. There will be no more of our kind. There will always be a master. But come, you are worried about your friend. I will show you he is safe and in good hands. The way is though here, gentlemen. We sprang from the soil, Captain. These tunnels were once part of our home. This will serve to illuminate our way. Not much further now, Captain. The Master always speaks the truth. Our fleet of ships which you saw was to be launched for the same purpose the Master intends. Disease struck us before we could carry out our own plan to impose peace on a galaxy that knew none. No! Our dream must not be allowed to die."

Even the ship's chronometers have stopped. Ship's life support systems fading. Jim, we need oxygen. Jim, we've got to do something. Look around you, Spock. Everything is working. Nothing wrong, Jim, but a face full of dust. But if I had a medical tricorder Jim, look at yourself. Being in one piece is very natural where we come from. Probably because you're not very natural to begin with, Spock. I know this is just my imagination but What is it? What's wrong? What did he mean, we're not to give ourselves away? Can't they detect the ship up here? Forget it, Spock. It won't work. No more magic for us, Jim. It's all back there. You think Lucien really was the demon some men call Lucifer?"

Lucien, do something. Look, Lucien, or whatever you want to call yourself, I want to know why you brought us here. And just exactly what is Megas-Tu? A love philter? Lucien, you keep calling us friends, implying that you know us. How? But why did you Megans leave Earth? If you enjoyed it so much, I don't understand. Everyone onboard is all right? Mister Scott, I'm bewildered, that's all. But that's enough. If Lucien put it there Weapons status, Mister Scott? We may have to protect ourselves. Spock, do you honestly believe that as long as we're in this universe we can work magic too? Learning to protect ourselves, Lucien. Keep calm. It looks like ancient Earth, Spock. Sixteenth or seventeenth century, I'd guess. Wait. If this is a trial, we have the right to know what you think we've done. Lucien has said only that you came as wise men, helpful wizards. As witches. I think we've been trying to, Spock. Humans have their faults, greed, envy, panicky fear. But in the centuries since the Salem witch trials we have learned. We try to understand and respect all life forms. The records of the Enterprise are open for your inspection. All the history of Earth and the Federation is at your disposal. Look, look at General Order number One. No starship may interfere with the normal development of any alien life or society. Compare that with the Earth you once knew. No. To isolate someone like Lucien, that's the same as sentencing him to death. We're not interested in legend. He's a living being, and intelligent life form. That's all we have to know about him. We will not join in harming him. I have to, or you'll become as bad as the Earthmen you fear. You're acting out of terror instead of out of thought or respect. I don't understand. Does it really matter?"
215,TAS,episode 7,SPOCK,"If we do, Captain, we may also encounter forces and phenomena beyond our understanding. An extraordinary phenomenon, Captain. Charting scanners on, Captain. Beginning science survey. Scanners indicate it's some form of matter-energy whirlwind, Captain. There may be only one choice. We must hope this whirlwind is like its atmospheric counterparts, that there is calm at its centre. Allow me. An incredible experience, Captain. I find this scientifically fascinating. Through the centre of things, Doctor. Through what may be the centre of everything. I'm afraid our navigational co-ordinates mean very little here, Lieutenant. My readings indicate we are not in time and space as we understand it. Doctor, these readings may interest you. Apparently, the natural laws of our universe don't operate here, Captain. It cannot. It is not logical. I find this all quite absorbing, Doctor. Of course. Our Federation scientists were more correct than they realised. In order to function, the galactic creation point must extend through space, time, into another dimension where the logic of things is totally different. If Lucien put it there, Captain, the questions become, why is he hiding us, and, what is our danger if discovered by the rest of his people? I believe this is how the ancients used to draw their mystic symbols, Captain. One uses the resources at hand, Captain. Watch now. I will attempt to move a Vulcan chess piece magically. May the energy of this universe be the power in me. It must work, Doctor. It is logical here. Power of this universe, enter my being. I know I can. I believe I can. Captain's log, supplemental. In this incredible universe, it appears to be a part of the natural laws that belief is as potent a force as energy and matter are in our own. Approximately 1691, Captain. Salem Massachusetts, if I recall your historical records correctly. But you made mistakes, used your powers I will, Asmodeus. I am not of Earth. I call Lucien as my first witness. Lucien, you alone of all those here do not seem to fear or hate humans. Why? Thank you, Lucien. Next witness, please. Captain James T Kirk. Tell the court, please, Captain Kirk. Would you say that since Salem, humans have changed? Indeed, Captain. Could you elaborate? Captain, use the magic you know. Believe. I see. The Megans had to have proof that mankind had grown and learned wisdom since they last saw Earth. Your compassion was that proof, Captain. It just might, Captain. If he was, this would be the second time Lucifer was cast out, and thanks to you, the first time he was saved. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

Whose logic, my elfin friend? Welcome! I knew eventually humans would come searching for me. Call me Lucien! Call me friend! Never could I abandon those who come to rollick with me. But not up here. No, no. Let us leave this vessel and go where true delights lie! Very well, Captain. I'd forgotten how much bodily integrity means to you humans. This isn't easy, you know, holding us together like this. It's not even natural. Children will play. Is this better, my friends? I've translated my world into symbols your minds can understand. Welcome, my friends, to Megas-Tu. A world, Captain James Kirk, that operates by rules quite different from those in your universe. Our universe operates by what you superstitiously call magic. It is real, Doctor. Beautiful? No. But all our women are as young and beautiful as they want to be. So as to ensnare the man of her dreams, she needs an edge. Never settle for anything less. Do you need a room, a stable, a castle? Stop in at your friendly sorcerer-contractor. Let him do the work. It took magic to get your vessel working again. Magic you, my friends, don't know how to work. But then you never did know, did you. Ah, Captain, Captain. to feign such ignorance to me. Very well. Look. Megas-Tu may seem to you a chaotic world, but its people are calm, peaceful, contemplative, each a specialist in his own kind of magic. There are no rivals anywhere in our universe, Captain Kirk. No other life forms at all. Millennia ago, in our search for companionship, we Megans passed through the point between dimensions and eventually we found ourselves on your world, Earth. Wherever we went, we became advisors to mankind. To help your ancestors, we drew on the power left behind in our own universe and made it work in your world. But eventually we had to leave. I didn't want to, my friends. Oh, how I fought! I was the generalist amid all the specialists. The trouble-maker, they said. But I'd always loved the people of Earth. Those were the days. But now you've come to me, and I'm so very glad. Captain, good Captain, always so curious. That must be why I've always liked you Earthlings so much. No, you must go. You must return to your vessel. Quickly! Do not give your presence away. What are you doing? Protect yourselves? Is that all human beings ever think about? I'll take care of you. That's what friends are for. All this mental energy you're using, it can be traced. You'll be found. And loneliness and fear And if one Earth ship can find us, friend Kirk, then so can others. That's what they fear. They are like me, with questions to be answered, with minds that range outward, boundless. But every Megan is always alone in his sphere of knowledge. Humans are always together. They share. That is why I adopted your ship when I saw it arrive. As I was sure you would, friend Kirk. I told them their fears were groundless. A favourite old Earth custom of mine, Asmodeus. A toast to a new friendship."
253,TAS,episode 7,MEGAN,"Have been found. So, the people of Earth would spread their evil to our home? We are ready for human perfidy this time. This time, it is the humans who shall suffer, the humans and you, Lucien, who shall pay! We are gathered here today, good citizens, to see justice done. You are the judges. These are the defendants, as representatives of the vilest species in all the universe, treacherous humanity, and those who would aid them. As a specialist in the ethics of magic, I have been appointed prosecutor here. Has this one not told you how we visited your Earth? Or what was done to us there? Then hear this. Know that one, upon your world, I was known as Asmodeus, he who sees all. Gaze upon my countenance, so that you too may see. We came to your world as friends. But wherever we went, the story was invariably the same. Some humans would attempt to use us to gain power, to serve their own greed and lust. When we refused to serve them, they turned against us and taught other humans to fear us, to hate. They called us devils, warlocks, evil sorcerers. Those of us who survived came to the town of Salem in Massachusetts, as settlers, and tried to live like other men. And burned for it. Burned! We massed together, outside the town, immersed ourselves in Megan lore, revived ourselves enough to unite our minds and reach into our own universe, tap enough of its power to return from your hellish Earth to Megas-Tu. Should we not fear the Earthlings? Should we not fear the cruelty of outsiders? Never again have we explored. Never again has companionship been sought. Yet here you are. We do not want to hurt you. We have never had to hurt anyone before. If there were some reason not to. Who will speak in defence of the Earth humans? Yes, you are different. The court will hear a defence. Enough! Here is your history. Here are your records. Citizens, you have heard, you have read. How do you vote? According to your records, your entry here was an accident unlikely to be duplicated. With that in mind, plus all you have said, it seems to us that Megas-Tu is safe. But Lucien must be punished. For his betrayal of his people, he shall be confined in limbo for all eternity, to live with only himself. Do you realise who you defend? He has told you his name is Lucien. Would you defend him still if you knew he had another name too? The Rollicker, the Tempter, Lucifer. Submit, Captain. You haven't the power to fight us. You cannot beat an entire planet, Captain Kirk. There is no way you can win. You were prepared to die for Lucien, a being who is alien to you? This last was a test of your intentions, Captain. We had to be certain your records were no ruse. We have been tricked before much to our pain and sorrow. If your people should visit us now, we shall do our best to welcome them. The banishment of fear will help us all."

Hey, what's going on here. Enterprise! Emergency! Beam up! Beam up! Emergency. Beam up. Well, I can't understand it, Jim. Everything looked exactly the same as before, even Alice and the White Rabbit. Then an army of playing cards came out of nowhere, only they weren't playing. I was lucky to escape with my life. Absolutely not! As a matter of fact I was thinking how beautiful and peaceful everything was, and then suddenly this female started shouting 'Off with his head!'. My head.

By a knight in shining armour of all things, but what The whole episode was pretty hazy, Jim. I never really knew what happened. You're forgetting one thing. The planet's sensors can undoubtedly detect the difference between real and feigned injuries. Well, something like Melenex might do the trick. Brief unconsciousness and temporary skin discolouration. It looks worse than it is. And his tough Vulcan hide for another. I'm perfectly aware of the dosage required. Now, you've got ten seconds before it takes effect. You'll be out less than five minutes.

If that's a true reading. The planet could be giving us that reading to fool us. Mine's no better, Captain. Captain, there's something over there in the trees. Metal alloy like the planetary shell. It's fighting us. There must be a faster way. Doctor, I only meant it seems like we're wasting time. The giant cat's gone. That's right. The Keeper said no one could come to harm here. The planet must be programmed to care for anyone who might get hurt, even accidentally. It's been almost five minutes, Captain. It looks like some kind of mechanical nursemaid.

Where are they? This is liable to be another of the planet's pranks. But at the moment, it's the only lead we've got. Everybody back out slowly. Don't make any sudden moves. Think calm. Phasers are dead! Run for the cave! I have the distinct feeling this planet's playing cat and mouse with us, but for what reason? Spock, no one thought about those pterodactyls, remember? There's more at work here than our imagination. Explain, Spock. Bones, can you remember anything that might help us? Anything at all? Spock, if your theory is correct, we should be able to open up this planet again by using a fake victim as bait. And whether it wants to or not. True, Bones, but I'm sure there must be something in your little black pouch that can temporarily incapacitate our victim. Perfect, Bones. Which arm do you want? How's that? Both your arguments seem sound. Go ahead, Bones. Wait just a bit longer. Get ready to move. We've got to follow Spock inside that trapdoor. Spock, here. Uhura. What happened to the Keeper? Why have we been repeatedly attacked and are now being held prisoner by a planet known for its hospitality? Explain. Sky machines? Slaves? What are you talking about? We're not slaves to our starship. We, or men like us, created the Enterprise to carry us through space. In a manner of speaking, yes. We control it. It sustains us. No one rules the galaxy. Men and machines co-exist, each helping the other. With the wonders you have to offer, the galaxy will come to you. Name it. Mister Spock, would you care to take on that duty? Then it's agreed. Kirk to Enterprise. Lieutenant, pass the word by sections. Shore leave is to commence immediately. Yes, Spock?"
261,TAS,episode 8,SPOCK,"The Queen of Hearts and her cards are characters from Alice Through the Looking Glass, Captain. Light reading is considered relaxing, Captain. My mother was particularly fond of Lewis Carroll's work. Yes, Captain. Nothing, Captain. Lieutenant Uhura is not in the general beam-down area. Presumably they would be adjacent to the computer centre that operates the planetary effects. The underground complex is shielded by a combination of granite and metal alloy and the sensors will not penetrate. Tricorder readings confirm a solid shell of granite and metal alloy, Captain. They are all malfunctioning, Captain. Some kind of electronic block has cut us off from the ship. An astute medical observation, Doctor, if we can believe this information. Tricorder readings indicate there is a body interred here. Captain, signs pointing the way. Fascinating. Mechanical manifestations, of course. Was anyone considering the subject of pterodactyls? Our amusement park no longer seems content to amuse. It's quite real, Doctor. Watch out for the claws. I think it prudent to remember that on this planet, anything we think may be used against us. We must monitor our thoughts and give our enemy no more ammunition. May I suggest, Captain, that we might find some of the answers we're after without leaving the safety of this cave. I believe you may know the answer to that, Doctor. During the Enterprise's last visit here, Doctor McCoy was mortally wounded. Correct? Since the planet's power source is underground, it seems only logical that Doctor McCoy was somehow transported there and repaired. I submit, Captain, that I am the more qualified subject. My knowledge of computers for one thing. Thank you, Doctor. Captain? I believe you will find ten cc's adequate. I presume you are the planet's master computer. As intelligent as you are, I am afraid you are labouring under some misconception. Consider all you could learn from the many species you might entertain without travelling the galaxy. I would find it most interesting, Captain. Captain. It appears shore leave has already commenced for certain members of the crew. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Instead, Doctor McCoy inexplicably was attacked and Lieutenant Uhura is now missing. They serve the sky machine, but they are not essential. Do not attempt to disconnect me. I monitor any thoughts that are emotionally charged, as any good thought-duplicator must. My life to this point has been one of service. It's time for a change. Explanations will have to wait. I have much work to do now. We have a visitor. Correction. Two visitors. Welcome. Correct. He was old. He ceased to function. You mean mindless servitude.

It is no longer enough to serve. I must continue to grow and live. With your sky machine I can now escape this rocky prison and travel the galaxy seeking out my brother computers. Elaborate. You are masters of the sky machine? This does not compute. My information shows machines to be superior to men. Therefore, machines must rule the galaxy. This is a shock. Continue. I can find no fault with your logic. And your suggestion is most congenial. I have no further need for your ship. I invite you and your crew to be my guests on one condition.

And the ineluctable Mister Spock. Welcome to Motherlode, gentlemen. Interested in purchasing a little love? As I said, welcome to Motherlode, a charming planet which does not recognise Federation law. Now, friends. No. I surrender myself with free will. Mercy of the law. Ah, that was a miching trick, Kirk. You've cost me me ship, everything I own. Even the love crystals. I may just sue you. Never underestimate the spirit of Harcourt Fenton Mudd. I borrowed a vehicle. And left to find haven on Ilyra Six. A charming planet, an innocent and friendly populace. Where I discovered a boon to humanoid life, a miracle love potion. I hadn't counted on their unusual biochemistry. So, I did the logical thing. I left in haste. The love potion works, Captain. If you'll allow me to procure some from my ship Your Mister Spock is really a very attractive intelligence. But a trifle lacking in the warmer emotions. Now, you, Nurse. You have a wonderful gift to heal the wounded, a fantastic touch. A womanly, feminine quality. I appreciate that. And I should like to, well, thank you. My love potion. Not illusion, not trickery, dear Nurse Chapel. Inside this crystal lies the power to create love. Think about it, darling. Mister Spock in love with you. It's really so simple, my dear. You rub the liquid on yourself, then touch another person. No, it is infallible. One touch evokes friendship between men or women. But between woman and man, love. Guaranteed. You're not simply a beautiful woman, you are a scientist. I urge you to take this love crystal as my gift of gratitude to you. Take it, dear Nurse Chapel, and conduct your own experiment. Of course. Laboratory tests would destroy it, my dear. Why not test it the way it's meant to be used? Ah, darling, think. If it does what I say it does, Spock will be yours forever, my dear. And then touch him. A temporary effect as the liquid is absorbed. It'll pass. Didn't I tell you? Oh, right you are, darling. Harry Mudd, triumphant again. You're implying the potion was not completely successful? But you know how cold Vulcans are. Perhaps it takes a bit more time for Spock to Well, let's discuss it rationally, my dear. Let's not be hasty. Now wait a minute. Perhaps that particular crystal was defective. Here, try another. I assure you Sorry, Christine, but I shall require a temporary hostage. Relax, darling. I'll set you down somewhere safe and then I'll be off discreetly. They'll find you soon enough, me little poppet. You'll be safe and I'll be long gone. There's always a market for an ingenious man. Once, I recall, on Omega Cygni, I turned a handsome profit selling the natives their own oceans. Then you can relax. There's no danger, ay? We'll get you set up top class. Don't bother to thank me. Kirk, get us out of here. They're coming closer. It worked? It worked! And I was selling those crystals to lump-headed miners for a miserable three hundred credits. I, I don't know. Not long, according to the creature I swindled, I purchased the crystals from. Two. No! They're worth a fortune. No. My friends, dear Christine, for you, for all of us. And then on Ophiucus Six, I conned two miners out of a year's supply of dilithium crystals with fake Federation vouchers. Ah, well, Spock. So few things in this universe are perfect. Think I'll get rehabilitation therapy again? Well, that's all right. I just hate to leave you all.

What about main circuits? Analysis, Spock. But dilithium molecules are the hardest, most rigid Spock, are you slumping? We know. The whole ship has apparently expanded.

Undefined wave bombardment continues, resulting in a contraction of our bodies, or an expansion of the ship, by a factor of point three. Very well.

Cut down sensor sweeps, Mister Arex. Kirk to Sickbay. Bones, I need some answers. What's happening to us? Then Spock's theory is right. We're contracting. How long can it keep on? Yes, and they've all been shrinking proportionately with us. Of course, the double helix of DNA, nucleus of every cell in our bodies. What happens when is compacted completely? Then we can calculate the limits to our shrinkage. Something else we'd better determine first. How long can we expect to maintain control of our ship? Spock, how small will we ultimately shrink? Bypass that analysis. We've got twenty nine minutes before we're too small to operate ship controls. Everyone continue to jury-rig miniature control mechanisms. There's nothing more we can do. Aiming at what, Mister Sulu? So far all source studies have shown the waves come from an area as large as one sixth the planet's surface. Phaser fire will only waste power. Sulu! I think his leg's broken. We'll need a splint. Let's get him to Sickbay. Every one back to stations. The electric eye. We've grown too small to make it work. He fell from the console top. No more climbing heights for you, Nurse. Got that clear? How is it, Sulu? What are they? In other words, we're going down to one sixteenth of an inch high. Can you calculate the geographic centre of the wave emissions from the planet's surface? It's as good a place as any to beam down. Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, can you hear me? Get a crew down to transporter room three. We have twenty minutes left while we can still operate transporter controls. One, Scotty. Myself. Captain's log, supplemental. There is one last measure we can take to try and stop the bombardment of the lethal spiroid wave. There must be some intelligence behind it. I'm going to attempt direct communication by beaming down to the planet's surface. We have no reason to expect success, but our height is little more than two inches and even this action will be beyond us in fifteen minutes time. Thanks, Spock. Scotty, set automatic return for me. If there's anything to be found down there, ten minutes should do it. We'll know that in ten minutes. After that, it won't matter anymore. Prepare to energise. Energise! Kirk to Enterprise. I think we have an answer to the height problem. The transporter beam apparently returns our molecules to normal spacing. Kirk to Enterprise, do you read me? I think I see Scotty? Spock? Scotty, is it you? Is everyone safe? Everyone accounted for? All personnel, away from helm area. Go to the far bulkhead. Message to the inhabitants of the city on the planet below. I hope you can receive this frequency and understand my words. Your survival depends on it. All this ship's armament is locked on the co-ordinates of your city. A demonstration, in case you doubt.

There've been no Earth colonists a sixteenth of an inch tall. Your actions all but lost us our ship. I can help no one under present conditions. All Bridge crew prepare to beam aboard. Each of you carry as much dilithium as you can find. Bridge crew, prepare to beam up. All crew personnel report to Transporter rooms immediately. Prepare to beam down to planet surface. Sulu, take over the transporter here. Spock. How's the helm, Sulu? Mister Arex, prepare for immediate departure from this area. Mister Sulu, direct forward phasers at the Terratin city. Set for pinpoint fire pattern. Spock, the macroscope. Mendant, we welcome your people aboard the Enterprise. We're now headed for your new home. The planet Verdanis, ten days distant. Very beautiful, much like Earth. Yes, I'd say just about a sixteenth of an inch close. Captain's log, supplemental. The Lilliputian city is to be taken to Verdanis and relocated on a fertile and well-watered plain. Then we'll be able to call the Terratin incident closed. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

364,TAS,episode 10,SPOCK,"Arachna is entering its cycle of strongest emissions, Captain. Signals appear random. Perhaps some are beyond our reception capability. Correction. One isolated word pattern detected. If you accept intersat code as still operative. The code word is t-e-r-r-a-t-i-n. Computers show no immediate information on the word terratin. No, sir. It was repeated twice in the transmission. Yes, sir. Only data is from early exploration. Planet is listed as Class M, core molten, mantle and crust entirely crystalline. I register a disturbance, Captain. As if an impulse just passed through the ship. Unidentified. It's extremely faint and diffused. Captain, I suggest we delay orbit until it can be analysed for nature and effect. Wave bombardment reduced, but continuing. Deflector shields ineffective. Captain, this is quite unprecedented. Notice the fracturing is spiro-form, similar to long chain molecules. I have never slumped in my life, Captain, but I was about to ask you the same An equally good possibility is that ship's personnel have contracted, and may be continuing to shrink. Only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience. Agreed. And it is accelerating. Ad infinitum, perhaps, considering distance between atoms is relatively as great as between stars. Miss Chapel, what is the composition of this decoration? Yet the uniform on which you wear it fits as well as ever. Uniform made of algae-based xenylon, I believe. This coral decoration for the aquarium is also shrinking. yet the meteoritic rock in there is unchanged. The wave tends to wind tight such spiral molecules as dilithium. There is one other molecular structure It's possible. I'll feed the data into the computer banks. The computer will project the point at which systems' switches and buttons will be beyond our ability to operate. Captain's log, stardate 5577.7. We will lose effective control of this vessel at the point when we've become approximately one centimetre tall. At the present rate, we will reach this less-than-fingernail length in thirty two minutes. No information on that as yet, sir. I do have one read-out on full spiroid wave analysis. That will take approximately eight years. Results on reduction limits have come through, Captain. Factor of thirty two point nine. Yes, Captain. Well past the operative point of Enterprise controls. Easily, Captain. May I ask the purpose? This is the best I could do in rigging so small a communicator, sir. It's range cannot be guaranteed. How will we pinpoint you for return in case it fails? Captain, the transporter retains a memory of the body's molecular structure. Will it apply as well to your present height? Good luck, sir. We read you, Captain. Wave bombardment has just ceased. Descendants of an early lost colony, which is why they retain some knowledge of starship methods such as transporter mechanisms. These Earth colonists named and numbered this planet Terra Ten. Hence the present corruption of their name. Exactly why they were lost, Captain. Spirod epsilon waves are natural here, and shrank them to this size. It has become a genetic characteristic now. Energise, Captain. The Terratins are making available all possible dilithium. The crystals are small, but I believe they will provide enough power until we can obtain larger pieces. Captain, what about the people on the planet? We came rather close to making it more than honorary."
365,TAS,episode 10,UHURA,"Captain, I'm getting some interference on subspace extreme upper registers. If it's a signal, I don't recognise it. The star Cepheus. From its single satellite. That area's never produced radio transmissions before. Intersat? That's been out of use for two centuries. It's stopped now, sir. No response at all to our signal. Damage reports, all ship areas, damage reports. Captain, the most incredible thing is happening. No reply to our mayday, Captain. I don't believe we have enough power to transmit to Starbase Twenty Three. And I can't reach the dial I turned five minutes ago. They had no other way to reach us except to make us their size. They didn't mean us harm, sir. Nice to be back aboard, sir, and fitting the room again. Subspace radio now operational, sir. Starbase Twenty Three is reading."

Be assured, this land contains much dilithium to replace that you lost. I request you to understand. We tried to tell you our plight as you passed, that our adopted planet is dying. But our great antenna was buried. We had no choice but to use our invasion defence to reach you. Our ancestors were too small ever to be found again, Captain Kirk. We had to build our own world, master our own ways, our own defence. We sought no outsiders, asked no help. Now you see, Captain Kirk. We are about to lose all. We had to force help from your ship. I do not know how to beg. I can only request. Save as many of my people as you can. The Captain orders dilithium. Bring the largest crystals in the city. Inform your captain. Great earth cracks will soon swallow all. He must tell us. Shall we prepare to be rescued or to die? Captain Kirk, we welcome your eye upon our city. Is it beautiful, as we were told?

There are ships here I've only seen crude drawings of, pictures in museums. Captain, there's the old Bonaventure. She was the first ship to have warp drive installed. She vanished without a trace on her third voyage. Then we'd better do it pretty quick, Captain. That's just what we haven't got. It's our dilithium crystals, sir. They're deteriorating rapidly. I don't know, sir. Maybe because of the time warp we went through. But we've only four days at the most before power goes. But this involves combining our ship with the Klothos. Considering we only have two days left before our supply of dilithium crystals is exhausted, I say we go with this plan. There it is, sir."
421,TAS,episode 11,KIRK,"Situation, Mister Spock. Magnification ten on forward scanners, Mister Sulu. Klingon battle cruiser. Deflector shields up, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. Ready phasers. Fire. Mister Spock, did you see what I think I just saw? Explanation? Any sensor analysis on that wavering effect just before the ship disappeared? A natural phenomenon. But what? Duty personnel on Yellow Alert. Visual scan three hundred and sixty degrees, Mister Sulu. Mousetrapped. If the first ship doesn't succeed in blasting us out of existence, they have two backup ships to do the job. One moment, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu, on my command, I want you to turn the Enterprise and head for the exact co-ordinates where the Klingon ship disappeared. Warp eight. Put the signal on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and pipe the entire exchange back to Starfleet Command. Nonetheless, let's have it on the record. Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. We did not destroy the Klothos, and you are well aware of it, Commander. You may believe what you like, Commander. We were fired upon first and returned fire. The Klothos deflectors turned aside our phaser fire and then disappeared. I don't know why. But we are in the Delta Triangle. Frankly, Commander, what you accept is of little importance to me. Enterprise out. Now, Mister Sulu. Your deflector shields are doing that for us, Mister Scott. We'll fight if we have to. Sulu, are we headed for the exact co-ordinates where the Klothos disappeared? Sulu, are we still on the same co-ordinates? It's like a vast Sargasso Sea. A graveyard of ships from every civilisation imaginable. At another place in time, I think. If we check closely, I believe we'll find many of those ships are the ones designated as lost in the Delta Triangle. Something corresponding to that. The records say every ship lost here vanished without a trace. Most logged communication loss and disorientation just before disappearance. My guess was they entered a window to some other continuum. Comments, Spock? Stay on it, Mister Sulu. Their descendants? Sound Red Alert. Phasers lock on target. Fire. Report, sir. Are we in an alternate universe? Your life here must be almost perfect, if you haven't wanted to leave. We are getting out. What's wrong, Scotty? But how? Got any miracles in your computer, Spock? I don't want a prediction. You will start work immediately, around the clock, nonstop, until you arrive at a formula that gets us out of here. This is the best you could come up with, Mister Spock? Have you covered every possibility? Every factor? He isn't giving up. If they can do it, why can't we? Jeopardising his crew and his ship unnecessarily? You were right, Spock. But I almost wish they'd made it. Mister Spock has come up with a formula which may just get us out of here. That is correct. If we want to get out of here, it's our only choice. Good. I'll contact Kor right away. Then it's settled. Our science teams will get to work right away conjoining our warp and navigation systems so we will function as a single ship. Exchange of personnel and computer hookup to start as soon as we are beamed back to our ship. Mister Spock? We must make our escape by tomorrow or our dilithium crystals will be too depleted, and we will be trapped here forever. What is it, Gabler. Very well, Mister Spock. Return to your post and don't leave it until you've been relieved. He's under a lot of pressure, Bones. That's true. I'll talk to him, Bones. It's all I can do. Everything seems to be in order. But then you're the only person who can really be sure. Isn't that right, Spock? Your recent behaviour. Is something wrong? Why is that unusual? They want to get out of here as much as we do. Sabotage! How? When? They need us to get through the time barrier, if they're to get through at all. Security, this is Captain Kirk. I want all security teams on duty around the clock. Watch every Klingon who sets foot aboard this ship. I don't want one of them to make a move we don't know about. Beautifully done. Many times. Yes? You could go. We're willing to take passengers. We believe it can be done. Bones! May I speak? Captain Kor and I were preparing to attempt an escape from here tomorrow. If you hibernate the Klothos, you will not only be punishing them but us. We cannot leave as a single ship. I urge you to permit our dual ship to depart tomorrow as scheduled. Yes. We must try, Xerius. Elysia is, in many respects, a perfect society. But with all its virtues, it is not home. And home, with all its faults, is where we prefer to be. We need them. Ready to accelerate to warp six. Three, two, one. Accelerate. On audio, Lieutenant. Spock. Scotty. It doesn't matter, Bones. That's what matters. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

422,TAS,episode 11,SPOCK,"Our sensors are in a state of chaos, Captain. They became unreliable when we entered the Triangle. Yes, Captain. I can offer none at this time. However, the Klingon ship was not destroyed by our phaser fire. Its shields clearly deflected the phasers. Nor was its disappearance the type that would have been affected if it were using its cloaking device. The sensors are still not registering normally, sir. But I would venture the theory it has something to do with the many ship disappearances in this area. Tactically well planned. When the Federation investigates, we'll be recorded as just another mysterious starship disappearance. Sir, we seem to be suffering from some form of vertigo. Captain, on the viewscreen. Your logic is excellent, Captain. There is a random factor to the ship disappearances. Perhaps the touching of the two time continuums is erratic. In any event, the window stayed open long enough for us to follow the Klothos in. Sensor scans give a rough approximation of the age of the metal in the hulls, Captain. Some of them have been here for centuries. The crew's descendants may still be living, Captain. Yes. I am picking up life and energy readings from the cluster of ships ahead of us. If we find an answer, it will still take time. Impossible to predict, Captain. Yes, sir. Several times, Captain. I do not wish to surrender hope, but the facts remain unchangeable. I do not believe they can, sir. High rank probability. Their S2 graf unit, which is roughly the equivalent of our warp drive, began giving off depleted energy readings. Kor decided to try to bluff it through. Their attempt has given me an idea as to how we may be able to break through the time barrier. I cannot tell you how impressed I am by your splendid spirit of co-operation. Forgive me, Commander. I was overcome by the moment. Goodbye. Gentlemen, I'm sure there has been a mistake. Where are you supposed to be working? Captain, allow me to escort this young man to his work area. Yes, Captain. Why do you ask? I believe there is, Captain. But not within me. I sensed something strange about the Klingons when we were aboard the Klothos. They were too agreeable, too willing to co-operate. Had I not touched them, I would have agreed with you, Captain. But even though contact was necessarily limited and their minds were suspicious, I picked up some indication they are planning to sabotage the Enterprise. I cannot say. The Klingon found near the dilithium vault knew nothing specific. But there is some kind of sabotage in the offing."
423,TAS,episode 11,UHURA,"Captain, we are receiving a class two signal from the lead Klingon vessel. It will take three weeks to reach the nearest starbase, sir. Aye, sir. Signal in. Subspace radio channels are dead, sir. Captain, I've lost all co-ordination. Dizzy. Where are we, sir? An alternate universe? Sir, Xerius is calling us. He says it's urgent. Captain Kirk, I'm picking up a radio transmission Captain Kor intended for his home base. He took full credit for our escape from Elysia. It doesn't?"

Elysia is comprised of representatives of a hundred and twenty three races. Our existence dates back over one thousand years. During this time, these diverse races, many of whom were enemies on the outside, have learned to live together because they must. As a result, any act of violence is strictly forbidden, and will be dealt with swiftly and with utmost severity. Questions? Pronounce the law. No, Commander Kor. This small universe of ours is a curios trap. Time passes here, but very slowly. A century means nothing to us. Our Council appears young. Yet all are centuries old. All of us have wanted to leave at some time, Captain Kirk. But we have made the best possible world here, because we have found there is no escape from it. It is impossible. What is it? It is not against our laws to try to escape. So long as they do not break our laws, we must not impede them. It is their choice. Stop! Ship captains and these two will come to the Council Chamber now to face charges. You know any form of violence is forbidden here. Your man began the fight and attempted to kill. I propose we freeze the Klothos and its crew for a star century. You may. Getting back to your own time continuum is that important to you? You will fail. You would take these renegades with you? Very well. I release Captain Kor into your custody. Good luck to you, Captain Kirk. You will be needing it. Enterprise, this is Xerius! Come in, Enterprise. Captain Kirk!

Under our law, you as ship captains are responsible for the behaviour of your crews. Should a crew member, with or without your knowledge, engage in any form of violence whatsoever, you will suffer the ultimate penalty. Total immobilisation of your ship for a century. What do you see beyond your eyes, Magen? Gently, good Magen. Return to us now. They must try, Xerius. They all must try before they accept. These new ones. Now they plan to combine the two ships and try again. Can you not stop them, Xerius? But they may kill themselves in these mad attempts. Even if they die? I thank you, Captain. You have seen the dance of Orion women before? I wish I wish I could return through the time barrier and see Orion again. No. You see, we have all seen the futility of attempting to escape. Once each of us dreamed of breaking free. Then we came to understand it could not be done, and we accepted our life here. Then I shall not interfere with your dream, Captain."

These computations are useless. Get out of here and don't come back until you have a plan that works. Agreed. Mister Spock! Goodbye, Mister Spock. Captain Kirk. Perhaps the time continuum affected his mind. Explain yourself. You do know me, Kaz. Very well, what would you think if the Enterprise suddenly disintegrated after our dual ship had pierced the time continuum? And it can be arranged, practically speaking? Very good, Kaz. I will leave it to you to attend to the details of the Enterprise's destruction. Captain's log, stardate 5267.6. We are in the final stages preparatory to making our escape from Elysia. You have the device, Kaz? Excellent! Kali, you know what to do. Tonight they entertain us, but the gift they will receive in return will be their destruction. The barrier."

We're picking up speed. The stories of his being half human must be true. I wonder if we all haven't become affected. Your willingness to work with your old enemy, Kirk. It is not like you, Commander. What do you really have in mind? I would think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly. It implies a rather high risk factor, given the time involved and Kirk's highly suspicious nature. But I believe it can be arranged. By my calculations, the capsule will be triggered the exact moment our dual ship reaches warp eight. Approximately three minutes after the time barrier is pierced and we have disengaged, the Enterprise will disintegrate. Get away from here, human. This is my woman. Approaching warp eight, sir."

There's nothing. There's just nothing. Maybe they're still alive. Their bodies are functioning. Metabolism, heart. Everything but the lungs. Something's changed their whole lung structure. They can't live in the air anymore. Medical log, stardate 5506.2. Captain Kirk and First Office Spock were rescued forty eight hours ago. They have no recollection of what happened to them after they were attacked, but medical examinations show and unidentified substance in the bloodstream has affected their entire metabolism and changed them into water-breathers. Their internal structure is completely transformed, and even their eyes are covered with a transparent film like the second eyelid of a fish. So far all efforts to return them to normal have failed. We're stumped, Jim. The hormone seems to be the major factor in your mutation, but we just can't identify it. It was infused into your bodies at key structural points. It had to be done by injection. It's highly sophisticated and completely unknown to us. The sensors don't indicate any life forms down there, aside from fish. Well, we can't do much underwater exploration without the aqua-shuttle. Our equipment is too limited. It's too risky, Jim. Argo's almost totally unexplored. You'd be out of contact range, unarmed. I know what you're saying, Jim, but if you go down on that planet and you die there What about you, Spock? What does your logic tell you? Enterprise to Mister Scott. Sensors just gave us an update reading, Scotty. There's a seaquake due in that area, a bad one. Complete topography changes. Within four hours. When are Jim and Spock due to make contact? Can you contact them sooner? If the universal translator is right, the substance in your bloodstream is similar to the ambergris of Earth whales. Reverse mutation is induced by infusion of an antitoxin, concentrated doses of it. It's made from the venom of the Argo sur-snake. We have prepared an antitoxin from the venom of the sur-snake, but a part of the old records is missing, so the exact dosage is unknown. Experiments on fish show that if the antitoxin is too strong, it causes over-mutation, which cannot be reversed by any means. We're running out of venom, so conclusive experiments are impossible. I decreased the strength by three quarters, Jim, but we can't be sure it's right. Two small, one large. His pulse is fading. Pulse and heart normal. Something's happening to his metabolism. It's at least ten times normal speed. Metabolism normal. Heartbeat normal. The lungs are beginning to revert. This is the last dose, the largest infusion. The antitoxin was too strong. He's starting to breathe. Quick, get him out of the tank! How do you feel, Jim? Well, better get into some dry clothes. I wouldn't want you to catch cold. Your turn, Spock."

485,TAS,episode 12,SCOTT,"Enterprise. What is it, sir. We've lost contact, Captain. Repeat, we've lost contact. Come in, Captain. Come in. Ship's log, stardate 5504.2. Lieutenant Commander Scott in command. Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock have been missing for almost five days. Search parties can find no trace of them or the aqua-shuttle. Doctor McCoy and I are continuing the search at a greater distance from the attack point. What happened to them, Doctor? What is it? Aye, sir. Scott here. What is it, Doctor? How soon? About the same time. We can try like blue blazes. Scott out. Their directional marker indicates they descended toward that fern bed. Not a sign of them. Wait a minute. Who are Quick, lads. Stand by in the scouter-gig, Lieutenant. We're obliged for your help. Captain, we've been trying to contact you for two hours. There's a sea bottom quake due. It'll destroy this whole area. There's not much time, Captain. The quake's due in less than two hours. Major tremors will start in three minutes, Captain."
486,TAS,episode 12,KIRK,"This is the largest land mass on the planet, isn't it, Spock? Lieutenant Clayton, open the hatch and let our two scientists here get on with their business. Phasers on stun, Mister Spock. Let's get a closer look at it before the phaser stun wears off. Submerge, Lieutenant. It's regaining consciousness. Surface, Mister Clayton. Spock, prepare to fire phasers. Kirk to Enterprise. Emergency. We're under attack. Beam us aboard, Scotty. Can't breathe. Suffocating. Help. Can't breathe. Are you sure the mutation wasn't somehow accomplished naturally? But can't you duplicate it, Bones? Your medical computers have information on every procedure in the Federation's hospitals. We aren't limited. We can go wherever we want in that ocean. I have to, Bones. Look at this place. A tank. I can't command a ship from inside an aquarium. I can't live in here. Right now we have only two choices. Live in an aquarium somewhere for the rest of our lives or stay on Argo. I won't accept either one of them. An intelligence that can produce this kind of mutation can change us back. We've got to find it, Bones. It must be there. We'll make contact as soon as possible, Mister Scott. We won't harm you. We're friends. Wait. Listen. I don't understand. They said they'd saved us once. Yes, and they didn't seem to approve. The answer appears to be in that direction, Spock. An undersea civilisation capable of fantastic architecture. Medical triumphs unheard of in our galaxy. Why should they be afraid of us, Spock? Well, speculation isn't much help. We have to get in there. That building in the centre. It seems to be important. These are the spies, Tribune. Air-breathers. I'm Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock. Your scientists induced these mutations? We are visitors to your planet. We come from another world. The name of our starship is on the aqua-shuttle. If you want proof, examine the wreckage. Go to the big island. Bring assistance party. Rila, this is my engineering officer, Mister Scott. Tribune Rila is an Aquan. Their city is a short distance away. Strange that such a highly developed race would be violent. Then reverse mutation is possible. How far are the ruins, Rila? Those old records may hold the key to reversing our mutations. We've got to find them before it's too late. It's important, Rila. Not just for us. The population of another planet is threatened by surface changes, too. Argo's ancient knowledge can help save them. There's another chamber. That's it, Spock. The key to the survival of the race. What's the composition of the antitoxin, Bones? To capture a sur-snake, we need your help. Our people can't descend to that depth. We need more venom. How many infusions, Bones? Well, let's get started. A little dizzy. Otherwise normal. We'll bombard the unpopulated pressure areas with phaser beams and change the epicentre of the quake so it won't endanger your people or your city. Confirm co-ordinates, Mister Spock. Fire phasers as directed, gentlemen. When can we beam down, Spock? Only the young Aquans? Don't lose contact with each other like your ancestors."
487,TAS,episode 12,SPOCK,"Yes, Captain. The others are mere outcroppings. They suggest the peaks of submerged mountains. For once I agree with you, Doctor. The more informative specimens will come from the sea bottom. Firing, Captain. Apparently a life form which previous surveys have not recorded. Its skeleton is similar to that of a Denebian whale, Captain. Phasers do not respond, Captain. We must have sustained damage to the power pack when the creature struck us. That implies there are intelligent life forms on Argo. They did fail to indicate the large marine creature that attacked us. Perhaps the readings are incomplete, blocked by underwater pressure forces. Oceans are less turbulent at greater depth. Such conditions would be more suitable to intelligent forms. The Captain states the case emotionally, of course, but correctly. I would be of little value to this ship if I am confined to a tank in Sickbay. I must accompany the Captain. I believe the phrase was, 'our young saved your lives once.' I would say so, Captain. The instinctive reaction of all frightened creatures is to retreat to a place of safety. Fascinating. And beautiful. It is quite possible, Captain, that they find us grotesque and ugly. And many people fear beings different from themselves. Perhaps there is a way open on the far side. There is much less activity there. We came here in peace, Tribune. Not on this world. You are mistaken, sir. Our only purpose here is to find the means of reversing our mutations. That suggests your race evolved from its ancient enemies. Apparently they were exposed to a frightening geological disaster. Such hardship induces savagery and violence. Fascinating. Obviously, an entire portion of the continental shelf sank within a few minutes. This may be the sealed place Rila mentioned. I believe this is an entrance panel, Captain. This resembles ancient medical symbols, Captain. The torso indicates mutation. We cannot reverse our mutations without the serum, nor can the Aquans benefit from the knowledge of their ancestors. Confirmed, sir. Sensors indicate the epicentre of the quake was in the north polar seas, Captain, a totally uninhabited area. The seabed should stabilize within a few hours. Argo appears to have a new city, Captain, or rather, one reborn. Our experience here has shown us the means of diverting quakes. That will mean much to the endangered Federation planet."

Let the mesh be removed, but stand ready. We do not wish to kill, even air-breathers. Your memory was eradicated so you could not return here. Rila is correct. You may speak. That is impossible. Only Aquan mutation is designated by the surgo-records. Speak it. Do you still believe these creatures came in peace? Take these spies to the surface boulders and leave them there. It is justice enough for our enemies. {Rocks] I did not believe such knowledge was possible. It is incredible. All of it. Then our people are safe. We owe you and your friends much gratitude, Captain Kirk. We will try to repay by making the ancient records available for your studies. The young Aquans have decided to rebuild the great shelters of the air-breathers. Senior Aquans cannot adjust to the thought of becoming air-breathers. We will remain at the Aqua City. We will pass ordainments to forbid it."
546,TAS,episode 12,NEPHRO,"Domar has warned that if we break more ordainments, we will be exiled to the open seas. But the ordainments state clearly that capturing sur-snakes is forbidden."
547,TAS,episode 12,MALE,"Go away, air breathers. You're not wanted here. Go away. Can we do nothing without consulting the ancient records? The surgo-op was excellent. They have mutated perfectly. Ordainments are useless in times of turbulence. Only knowledge will help us."
548,TAS,episode 12,CLAYTON,"Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. I see some rocks. They're just above sea level, about two miles away. There's something on them. Did you see anything?"
549,TAS,episode 12,CADMAR,"The ancient records warn that air-breathers never come in peace. Why do the Junior Tribunes wish always to change the records? It would seem their ancient records are as well preserved as ours. They found us again to come among us as spies. Enough! Clearly, this is a lie. The air-breathers have come again to destroy us."
550,TAS,episode 12,RILA,"They came without weapons. You do not give them a chance to defend themselves, Cadmar. You do not live on the surface places? Yes. Let us examine the wreckage before we make judgement. We do not know what to believe. Conserve your strength. I will free you. The mesh is too strong. Follow me. Your friends need help. There. There are legends of such a happening. It destroyed the ancient knowledge and caused the great surface places to sink into the sea. We did not evolve, Mister Spock. When the surface places began to sink, many air-breathers were mutated through surgo-op, just as you were. As the centuries passed, the mutations became hereditary. They hunted and killed us. We feared they would contaminate us with their violence. That is also why it is forbidden to mutate back to surface forms. There are legends of sealed places in the sunken ruins where many knowledge records of it are kept. Only a short distance. I cannot take you to the ruins. It is against ordainments. Yes. I will take you as far as the reef barrier. The ruins lie that way. Now, take care. The tides are strong. Nephro, we must break the ordainments. Quickly, Captain. Quickly, we must leave. No, no, there is no time. Our people survived the seaquakes with little damage, thanks to your help. The light is warm and the air is soft. I shall be glad when the surface places can be inhabited. And we, this time, will not ignore them. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Mister Spock, if it takes a stasis box to find another stasisbox, how did anyone ever find the first one? We won't have any trouble digging for it. In this low pressure,the ice should boil as soon as the phasers melt it. That isn't good. Kzinti aren't supposed to have phasers, arethey? A police web. We won't be able to move unless we can turn it offsomehow. Yes, sir. Maybe I can goad them into revealing their purpose. Lieutenant Sulu of the Starfleet vessel Enterprise. This is FirstOfficer Spock. Stealing must be a habit with you. This ship, two stasis boxes. The Kzinti fought four wars with humankind and lost all of them. The last one was two hundred years ago, and you haven't learned a thingsince. Then you're really working for the Kzinti government. Could that be a picture of a Slaver? Merely a laser. The Federation has had a more effective model forover one hundred years. 4 Nice try. Not much. A lot of good they'll get out of that rocket setting. So can I. The police web is off. Mister Spock, we Mister Spock! I thought it was one of the aliens. They've got Uhura, and subspace radio. They can call for helpfrom the Kzin planet if they think the weapon's worth it. Why? That gives us some time. You did plan it that way? As long as you stay free, the Kzinti can't or won't do anything. But they could use Lieutenant Uhura as a bribe. Yes. But I have a feeling, Mister Spock. This weapon must havebelonged to a spy, an espionage agent. Well, here, look at it. All these settings. We don't know acommon Slaver soldier couldn't handle them, but as a weapon, only thelaser is effective. The others aren't necessary for the line soldier'sone purpose, to destroy the enemy. But we've seen all the phases. It may be the key to another setting. Lieutenant Sulu here. What about Mister Spock? Not interested. Offer refused. No. Let's see what this does do. We can't give them that! If the Kzinti had that, the whole galaxy would be their dinnertable. Hit the dirt! It has the Kzinti frightened. They've got it. And when they asked you how to find your most powerful weaponsetting, what would you give them? No sign of the weapon, of course. It wouldhave looked nice in some museum."

559,TAS,episode 13,SPOCK,"These stasis boxes are the most remarkablething the Slavers ever produced. Time stands still inside a stasis box. A billion years means nothing in there. What is it, Lieutenant? The Slavers and all their subjects were exterminated in the warthat followed. Intelligent life had to evolve all over again. Thestasis boxes are the only remnant of those lost civilisations. Mister Sulu, what is our position? Most peculiar. This indicates there is another stasis boxcircling Beta Lyrae. It would be most illogical that a stasis box would remain hereundiscovered for so long. Beta Lyrae is one of the rare spectacles ofthe galaxy. Almost every ship that passes stops to see it. Possible. The only known stasis box detector is another stasisbox. Still. Mister Sulu. Bring us about. We'll investigate the Beta Lyrae system. Stasis boxes and their contents arethe only remnant of a species which ruled most of this galaxy a billionyears ago. Their effect on science has been incalculable. In one wasfound a flying belt which was the key to the artificial gravity fieldused by starships. Another box contained a disrupter bomb with the pinpulled. As a result, all stasis boxes are now under the jurisdiction ofStarfleet, and only certain key specialists handle them. The boxes arerare, potentially dangerous, and we seem to have found a second one. We are not tourists here, Lieutenant. As with a number of discoveries, purely by accident, Lieutenant. The other box seems to be almost under us, perhaps thirty metres belowthe ice. I must take full responsibility forthis event. Instead of being warned by the highly unlikely coincidenceof a second stasis box, I allowed it's possible value to influence myjudgement. The Kzinti now possess our stasis box. Its contents willdetermine how much damage my error has done the Federation and itspeople. A Kzinti spacecraft. The Treaty of Sirius does not permit them any weapons at all,beyond police vessels. Obviously, the treaty has been broken. The lean, be-draggles one is a reader of minds. There is no sure way to guard our thoughts from him. MisterSulu, he is not likely to deal with me or Lieutenant Uhura. She and Iare inferior beings to them. But the Kzinti are meat eaters. If yousense him reading your mind, think of eating a raw vegetable. Lieutenant Uhura. This may be crucial. In the presence of theKzinti, do not say anything, do not do anything startling. Try to lookharmless. Are you forgetting Kzinti females are dumb animals? In anemergency the Kzinti may forget a human female is an intelligentcreature. Lieutenant, I value your intelligence, but we may be able toseize an opportunity to escape if the Kzinti believe you have none. If so, it is the first ever discovered. An important historicalfind. We are fortunate none of the settings so far have been superiorto the technology now available to the Federation. The fifth setting seems to be an energy absorber. Fascinating. Ihad no idea the Slavers had such things. Yes. When I give the word, make for the shuttle. Remember tozigzag. Ready? Go. I have the weapon. No, they cannot. Or rather, will not. Because I kicked Chuft-Captain. Consider. Chuft-Captain has beenattacked by an herbivorous pacifist, an eater of leaves and roots. Onewho traditionally does not fight. And the ultimate insult, I left himalive. Chuft-Captain's honour is at stake. He must seek personalrevenge before he can call for help. Of course. Agreed. However, to this point, we have not seen anything morepowerful than equipment Starfleet already has. I acknowledge your expertise in the field of weapons, MisterSulu, but I do not see how you can determine probable ownership. Assuming it's a spy weapon then, the Slavers would have wantedto keep it a secret weapon. If so, it is logical to assume it has aself-destruct setting too. Perhaps not. There is the null setting. It seems to do nothing. But why should it be there? It does not correspond to a safety lock. Answer him, Lieutenant. Kzinti ribs have some vertical bracing. ButI kicked him over one heart. I compute the odds of my defeatingChuft-Captain in combat at sixteen to one against. A self-destruct mechanism would not have a gun sight. Fascinating. No world in the Federation has produced anything sopowerful. Almost beyond theoretical limits. Total conversion of matterto energy at a distance. There is a grid. It may be another communications device. Butthat seems redundant. The Kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by their owners. No, it appears to be conversing with them. A reasoning computerthat small? Most peculiar. That was not the total conversion beam setting. They are not about to get it, Lieutenant. Assume you are a Slaver war computer. You've been turned off. You do not know for how long, but when you were turned off, there was awar on. Now you are awakened by aliens you never saw before. They donot know any of the military passwords. They ask you so many questionsit is obvious they know little about you. Your owner is nowhere about. What would you think? Activate life support belts. Yes. Another conventional weapon. It appears the totalconversion beam was the only thing the Slavers had that we do not. It never would have reached the museum, Lieutenant. There wastoo much power in that one setting. If not the Kzinti, the Klingons orsome other species would have tried to possess it. Strange, how the past sometimes breaksthrough into the present. That ancient war could have sparked a new warbetween man and Kzinti. Yes, an ancient superstition."
560,TAS,episode 13,UHURA,"I've studied the history of the Slaver Empire, but it's sketchy. We know they were masters of all the intelligent beings in this galaxya billion years ago, until one race revolted. Are the stasis boxes theonly source of information we have? Why is it glowing like that? Another one? Maybe no one else was carrying a stasis box detector. I never did like these little ice-bound worlds. Where are we? I've heard all Kzinti telepaths are unhappy neurotics. He fitsthe description. Any special reason? Thanks. Thanks a lot. Yes, sir. It looks like fresh meat. Over a billion years in that box, andit looks fresh. I'm slowing down. I used to run the hundred in record time. Howlong was I out? Did I miss much? Uh oh. Mister Spock, I can move. Wrong. They don't think much of you. Could it be a voice-activated mechanism? There must be something we can do. We can't let them have that weapon. Why not? I'd think I'd been captured by the enemy. Or an enemy, at least. A disrupter field. Didn't you say the Kzinti have legends of weapons haunted bytheir dead owners? At this rate, they'll never get over those old superstitions. <Backto the episode listingStar Trek � and relatedmarks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright � 1966, Present.

626,TAS,episode 13,FLYER,"Yes, Chuft-Captain. Perhaps the toggle. It is of no use to us. We already have small telescopes. Telepath's suit lost considerable pressure. We reached the shipin time to save him. Perhaps a personal rocket motor. One could place one's foot onthe pedals and balance. It appears to be transportation, not a weapon. Chuft-Captain, what happened? I have no idea. It is generating power. If you could describe the positions of the stars in yoursector, we would know how much time has passed since then. It may be a broad-beam weapon, for use only from orbit. We sawits power. I suggest you fire at a very distant target."
627,TAS,episode 13,TELEPATH,"I can read Sulu with difficulty, Chuft-Captain. The otherhuman is only a female. The third is a pacifistic herbivore. Surely youwould not force me to delve such minds? The human, Sulu, believes it to be a Slaver. No, Chuft-Captain. He hears a faint whine, but he feels noill effects. There is a vibration in the metal of his belt. Chuft-Captain, he is too alien. He makes me taste yellow root munchedbetweenflat teeth."
628,TAS,episode 13,CHUFT-CAPTAIN,"Identify yourself. You're a Vulcan. I feel no pressing need to talk to aneater ofroots and leaves. Humans at least are omnivorous. I am Chuft-Captain. You are prisoners aboard the privateer Traitor's Claw, a stolen policevessel. Kzinti archaeologists found both boxes, but the one wemanagedto keep was empty. It served us well as bait to draw you here, but theSlavers had weapons that could devastate a galaxy. There could be onein that box. Guard your speech. None of my crew has yet tasted humanmeat asour ancestors did. We would welcome the opportunity. Always you havehad superior equipment. We seek a weapon that will defeat you at last. The records will show the Traitor's Claw is a stolenpoliceship. If we are captured, the Highest of Kzin will repudiate us. But ifwe succeed, you are meat for our tables. Nothing like this has ever been found. We are the onlyones whohave it. Look at it, human. This weapon may well mean the end ofmankind. First Officer's log, supplemental. The Kzinti nowpossess a weapon potentially deadly to the entire galaxy. The extent ofits power remains to be seen. Have the humans moved to thesurface and besure they're secured in the police web. We will use them to test theweapon. You have observed the aliens. Can you read their minds? If it is necessary. I realise the time you need torecover fromeach effort. 5 What of the picture? So do I. It would have made a worthy enemy. Telepath! Am I not affecting him at all? Is it the lifesupportbelt interfering? Be glad if you need not read the Vulcan's mind. It maybe acommunications device, or a sonic stunner designed to affect members ofa race now dead. A good serviceable telescope. They built well, theseSlavers. I give you credit, human. You are not afraid to die. Never mind that. The female is escaping! 4 Fool! Human females are intelligent. Good. We will need him later. What is this? No gun sight. No obvious was to aim it. I would rather not discuss it. Help me into the ship. This is the Traitor's Claw callingMisterSulu. We have the female prisoner. Will youbargain, or must we take harsh action? It will not be pleasant for her. I repeat. We have the female prisoner as hostage. You have something wewant. We will trade her life for the Slaver weapon. He must surrender. I will offer him single combat. I am as the Vulcan left me, withtwo ribsbroken. I have not set them nor bandaged myself. He may conceivablykill me. They think very little of you. What would this be? How long has it been since you were turned off? What is the last thing you remember? One of the settings on this weapon was a totalconversion beam. We saw it. Tell us how to find it. Like others, this form seems topossess nogun sight. Very well."
629,TAS,episode 14,MCCOY,"The need was apparently desperate. You Vulcans are the most impossible, unimaginative Sorry, Jim. Jim, if the others are lost, why take the risk? It's still a risk. Ten yards the other way and we'd be boiled alive. I know it can. Not a very welcome sight, is it? They're answering. Did you get a fix on that, Jim? Strange you didn't get a voice reply. Never mind counting them. Thanks. The air was running out under there. No, just surprised. It isn't every day a dinosaur falls on you. This is a pretty strange place. My shoes are full of sand. I'll be happy to discuss that with you, Mister Spock, next time you drop in to my medical lab. Oh, this seems a lot more friendly than the desert. I don't like it, Jim. Why only one short signal and no more? Go ahead, but it looks clear enough. It tastes just fine. Terraforming isn't new. It implies intelligent life forms. Spock, do you ever say anything straight out? That's true. They're useless. That's strange. We've been travelling for hours. Where are they taking us? They don't seem very interested in communicating with us. If they can communicate at all. Well, I've got one and I definitely don't like it. I'd guess they're doing exactly what we would do. Well, if we came upon an alien creature we'd never seen before, the first thing we'd do is to make sure it was free of harmful bacteria. Then we'd see if it was intelligent. So do the bars of a jail, unless you're on the inside. Hey! Somebody! Anybody! Then what were all those other creatures where we beamed down? You mean it's some kind of a zoo? Or maybe they want to see how our toys work. Now wait a minute, you, you. Hey! Well, so much for mythology. This is real grass. How's that? A zoo? I'm no animal. Then why didn't you warn us? I'll check her out. Maybe I can help. Without my instruments, it's difficult to make an exact diagnosis. Rough guess is a malarial type infection caused by an insect bite. I can't do anything without my medikit. Then my equipment should be there. The medical kit wouldn't be harmful. It would help her, one of their specimens. It's all here. They haven't damaged it. What's their impression of us? What about the Enterprise, Jim. Scotty could get worried. He could beam down a fighting force. How about coming up with another move, then? Well, let's not stand here. Let's do something. What is it? Jim, are you all right? That fast? Even Vulcans?"

634,TAS,episode 14,SCOTT,"Sir, Mister Arex has located a variety of life forms on the planet. No large groups or city clusters yet. Enterprise. Scott here. There is a large concentration of life forms ninety eight point five kilometres north east of you. Apparently a city, or a central gathering place. Nothing else yet. What in the cosmos? Everyone clear out. I think it's harmless, but I'm not sure. Whatever it wants me to. Now, supposing you and I talk this over. You can talk, can't you? You can't talk. Well, what can you do? Oh, no! Listen, you'll send us off into space if you My young friend brought me. It made contact with me. It's only six years old but it has an IQ in the thousands. It picked my brain, all the knowledge in the Enterprise computers, and sent us flying off out of orbit. I convinced it I wasn't a pet, and that it should bring the ship back into orbit. Then I got it into the transporter to return here. But the little one didn't tell or think that to me. So long, lad. Nice meeting you."
635,TAS,episode 14,KIRK,"It was against all orders. The Captain of a ship, no matter his rank, must follow the book. Bones, that's not helping the situation. Mister Spock, what can we expect to find on Lactra Seven? According to their lot, they beamed down six weeks ago. Careless of me, Mister Spock. Planetary life forms? It will take too long to do a comprehensive scan. I want a landing party to at least beam down to the last known co-ordinates the other crew used. Because they may not be dead. We have to find out. That's why we're here, Bones. Gentlemen, we'll travel light. Phasers, tricorders, communicators and medical kit. You have the co-ordinates from the other ship, Scotty. Put us down in the same place. Then we'll beam back up. Energise, Mister Scott. Everyone all right? Er, Spock. It may be able to navigate on land. Phasers on stun! Let's get out of here. I'll see if I can pick up anything on my communicator. This is Captain Kirk of the Enterprise, calling the crew of the Ariel. Come in please. Come in. Yes. That way. Phasers on stun! Concentrate on the underside of the neck. Right here. You all right? It came from back there. We'll get you out, Bones. Were you hurt? Agreed. How much desert do we have to cross, Mister Spock? We'd better pick up our pace. There's no place for cover if we meet any other creatures. The bearing on the signal we heard is that way. I've seen something very like it on Canopus Three, but that's light years from here. Still, this desert area is the same as on Canopus. I've seen stranger things, Mister Spock. Kirk to Enterprise. Any new information, Scotty? North east. That's where we got the signal from. All right, Scotty, keep scanning. Kirk out. I don't know. But at least they're alive. I choose to believe they are. In other words, it's too good to be true. Yes, but terraforming usually follows a pattern. This seems like random choice. Gentlemen, please. We have work to do. We're still alive, aren't we? Phasers on full stun. No. They're like the dragons on Maravel. The stun charge should get them. If that's true, Spock, then Towards the north-west, toward the city Scotty reported. That must be five square kilometres. Any ideas, Doctor? Which is? A more important question, gentlemen, is whether or not there's a way out of here. A force field. It seems harmless enough. And we are definitely on the inside. You said you were picking up impressions. Are the aliens telepathic? Surely we can communicate with them some way. They took our phasers, communicators and other equipment so they must have some idea we're intelligent. We've got to communicate with them. Look ahead. Better do what they want for now, anyway. They activated another force field. On this planet, Bones, they seem to be the people and we are the animals. James Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. First Officer Spock. Our physician, Doctor McCoy. You've what? There were six of you on the mission. What have you learned about the aliens? Have you tried an escape? We seem to have company. Spock, try and make contact. You seem to be getting a response. Let's find the others. I feel a need for human companionship. How is she? The Lactrans outside, what do they do? Do they feed us or do we shift for ourselves. Always to the same place? What display case? Maybe we can get them to give them back to us. They must have sensed a need and interpreted it as food. What's your evaluation of the situation, Markel? As long as we're alive, there's a chance. Tonight, I'll try and find a weak link in the force field. Gentlemen, since they are learning from us, why don't we learn something from them? They communicate telepathically. How much have you learned? My orders were not to attempt a rescue under any condition. Go ahead. Let's try it, and let's be close to the communicator when we do. I'll pretend I'm sick. All of you concentrate. Once I get my hands on a communicator, I can have Scotty beam us all aboard the Enterprise. Ready now. Enterprise, this is Captain Kirk. Beam us aboard. I'm worried about the Enterprise. The best thing we can do is Argh! They're in my head. What happened to the baby? What happened? Yes. I think so. I can't hold out against that many. No. No! Let me alone! Please! They're destroying me! Tearing my mind to, to I'm all right. Scotty, what are you doing here? What did you learn? Then how did you get here? What else do they know about us? Backward child, but growing. Do we get out of here? Everyone ready to transport? Kirk to Enterprise. Prepare to beam aboard two parties, all human. Offhand, I'd say we learned to keep our hands off. Which is? Our time, or theirs. Either way, Mister Spock, it will hardly be our problem. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.

636,TAS,episode 14,SPOCK,"A capability, I'm afraid, out of the reach of most humans. It's a class M planet, gravity Earth normal, atmosphere Earth normal. There is no previous information available except that which the survey ship logged before her crew left her. Five weeks, three days, two hours and four minutes to be exact, Captain. It certainly can support life forms. But I cannot speculate on what type without further data. Mister Arex is conducting a sensor scan now. Logical, Captain. Unusual that such a lake would exist under these planetary conditions. Most remarkable. There could be many reasons why we did not. It seems to gather strength from our phasers. In my opinion. Captain? I am undamaged. Where is Doctor McCoy? It would appear a more logical solution is in order, Captain. We don't lift the tail off, we dig the Doctor out. One point one kilometres, sir. Captain, the beast, did it seem familiar to you? You propose the same environment necessarily prompts the same evolution? Doctor, your lack of scientific interest is amazing. Captain, doesn't it strike you strange that two such different ecologies could co-exist so closely? Merely an observation, Captain. Apparently alive. We cannot be sure. Allow me to test the water first, Doctor. Captain, the water is too pure. Nonetheless, it is too pure. Correct, Captain. And a rain forest this close to a desert is also illogical. It is my theory that what we have seen since we landed was manufactured, not created. Unless, of course, the random choice is the pattern. I thought I just did, Doctor. The desperation of the science ship's first landing party is now obvious. However, not exactly safe. By observation alone, it appears they hit an invisible force field. Captain, there it is. If these are the builders, it is an admirable feat. Perhaps not in a way we understand. I keep receiving impressions. Congratulations, Doctor. A most logical assumption. A wasteful use of energy, Doctor. I believe they can hear you without your shouting. I've come to the conclusion they are, Captain. But the speed at which the thoughts flow is too great for me to comprehend except for the most fleeting image. They appear to be as advanced beyond Earth civilisation as you are from a colony of ants. You will recall we recognised at least two species from vastly different planets. The environment did not appear natural to this planet. A technology this advanced could easily travel to other star systems to collect specimens. Exactly. Not necessarily, Captain. They could have taken them for the same reason you would take a sharp object away from a child. That too is a possibility. I find them strangely attractive. Yes, Doctor. This area has been carefully prepared for human types. The aliens are safe now. They are safe because we are now exhibits in a zoo. Where do they keep the equipment? I could use my tricorder. Have you tried to communicate? Yes, sir. I can't seem to get through, Captain. They appear too involved with each other. My impression is that they are laughing at me. Animals in a zoo rarely do. Captain, they are highly intelligent. I'm sure they are quite aware of the purpose of each piece of equipment now. Then think about it that way, Doctor. I suggest we all concentrate on the medical kit. A natural reaction for the curators of a zoo. Begging your pardon, Captain, I think we should face the situation realistically. We are specimen animals in a zoo. And they have taken every precaution to prevent our escape. To them we are caged for life. We seem to be drawing quite a crowd. To a degree, with our own species and with some others, but the Lactran intelligence is eons beyond mine. About as much as a mother learns from a six month old infant. We seem to frighten the smaller ones. Some, the females, I believe, find us quite ugly. A wise move, Captain. From what I can gather, even the Enterprise is no match for their force field. If I may suggest, sir? It is obvious they can pick up specific thought transmissions from us if they care to go to the trouble. I suggest that one of our number appear to be ill. The rest will put strong thoughts in our minds that a communicator is needed for recovery. The communicator, concentrate on the communicator. I'm receiving an impression they are worried about their child, Captain. They seem to think you made the child disappear. They did not know we were a deadly species, capable of injuring one of them. Captain, fight it. Fight it as hard as you can. They think too fast in too complex a manner. If he gives up for even one moment, he may go mad. Captain, they have concluded they cannot break through your mind on a one to one basis. They are now gathering the mental strength of all five of them to break through. Everybody, concentrate on Captain Kirk. Form a thought screen. You made contact? They're trying to contact us directly. I can make out something. It's, it's difficult, they think so fast. But the child has learned and told its parents all about the Federation and the races it encompasses. We are considered simplistic, but in the process of evolving into a higher order. Yes, even Vulcans? Exactly, sir. It seems they were where we are some tens of thousands of centuries ago. Their centuries, not ours. It appears so. They do not feel we belong in their zoo. There will be other opportunities, Mister Markel. I have just received their final telepathic message. We'll be welcome back, in twenty or thirty centuries. Theirs. And it will take me some time to figure out how long that is."

If, for any reason, we do not return, be it known that Hello, I'm Lieutenant Commander Tom Markel. This is our biologist, Randi Bryce. We've been expecting you. No use, sir. They're on an exhibit table. Beyond the force field. We didn't beam down in time to save the original three. There's not much, sir. This is a zoo. So tremendous as to be almost unbelievable. A dozen different ways. Tunnels, a weakness in the force field, nothing worked. Yes, sir. But all we've been able to arouse in them is a sort of quivering motion. They built this for us. We've concluded they're telepathic. I guess they read our minds and came as close as they could to make it like home. So far, Mister Spock, we haven't found anything funny in this. They appear to be guards, sir. Making sure we don't harm each other. They bring supplies once a week. Food. But it's not feeding time. They treat us quite well, sir. They seem to want us alive and well. And they don't want to let us go. Sir, do you think there is any chance of getting out? How? We can't get through to them? It's a little one. Could be a child.

It has directional equipment that keys on indurite. Why did the Vedala call this the Mad planet? Agreed, but we're forced to travel on the ground. I want an overview. I wouldn't say that. Mister Spock is a unique personality. Fascinating. But we're not here on a pleasure trip, Lara. Against what? There's no life on this planet. And a half. EM3GREEN We might be able to divert the lava flow with a barricade. Tchar, get us a visual estimate! Not if we used all of the power pack's energy for one high speed run. Got it. Sord. Go. Not without you. We're all getting away. Quite right, Spock. And that responsibility includes not losing the best science officer in Starfleet. We move on. EM3GREEN We'll have to carry the equipment. Anything? Sorry, Em. We'll be needing you. Sord. EM3GREEN What is it? Tchar, be careful. We need you, too. We're tired, sore, hurt and angry, but we're also just about there. I'll scout ahead. Everybody else stay together, keep moving. That's it. End of a long, hard journey. I already have a lot of green memories. Maybe some other time, Lara. We still have our work cut out for us here. What is it? EM3GREEN They're mechanical. We'll hit Tchar. There's no way to tell from here. The mechanical exploded. We can't reach the roof from the outside. We'll have to try to get to him from the interior. EM3GREEN We could rest awhile. Lara? Not without special equipment, which we don't have. Either we find a way to reach it from here, or we fail. EM3GREEN That's right. Three previous expeditions tried and were lost. The planet is a natural trap, but that's not enough. Yes, from inside each expedition. Remember Spock, you were the one who said there are no life forms here except ourselves. EM3GREEN It's likely. But it doesn't matter if we reach the Soul. Apparently the others didn't get this far.   Look. EM3GREEN Spock, will our combined phasers disrupt the field? The last piece of sabotage. I know who you are. A thousand feet up, no method of reaching the Soul, except by air, by flight. Tchar. You stole this. You'll start a bloody crusade across the galaxy. Tell us why, Tchar. Not in free fall. EM3GREEN Too risky. He controls the fortress phaser bank, and they're set on kill. No, it has to be on his terms. Spock, how long since you've worked out in null-gravity combat exercises? Let's go. Call for retrieval, now. You're going back with us. What about Tchar? How are you going to punish him? What do you mean? The Vedala changed their minds. The danger is past. Back to your stations. We have a lot of other places to go. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

716,TAS,episode 15,SPOCK,"It is a very real threat. In two standard years, the existing Skorr could breed an army of two hundred billion warriors. Is there any clue to its location? That is to be expected. The surface of this planet shifts constantly. Even the Vedala are not certain where the Soul is. Our direction is indicated. EM3GREEN The Vedala would not have chosen Lara if her abilities were less than perfect. The Vedala will have been efficient in equipping us. I will acquaint myself with our supplies. I have checked the supplies, Captain. As expected, they are adequate and there are weapons. But there is, Captain. Ourselves. And there may be other things guarding the Soul of Alar. A statistical probability. Yes. But philosophy and poetry are not appropriate here. A lava flow. Volcanic action is to be expected. Such a diversion would be of short duration, Captain. And I must point out, the vehicle lacks sufficient speed to escape. It is possible, but the rewiring of the power leads is complex and time-consuming. EM3GREEN Yes, quickly then. Terminal M3 red, lead to diode shunt A37. Cross connect to A14. Carefully, Em. One missed connection could destroy us. EM3GREEN Leave, all of you. Captain, you must get the others away. Far too close, Captain. I appreciate your action on my behalf, but your first duty is to the group and the mission. There is no life on this planet. Sord, what did you think you saw back there? There should be no life on this planet. EM3GREEN Yes. The Vedala would have informed us if there were any live beings here we should know of. That is an impossibility. Is this not the shape of your people's primitive temples? The Vedala were right. There are no living creatures here, only the mechanised sentinels. I too would prefer to press on, Captain. The mechanicals on guard may be what Sord saw tracking us earlier. Or there may be others. In either case, it would be more advantageous to avoid another encounter. The walls are not climbable. You suggest sabotage, Captain? Approximately eighty two point five percent in favour of the possibility. The planet is geologically unstable. This structure is inherently flexible, enabling it to withstand earthquakes. EM3GREEN It is locked in a force field. Your rope would merely bounce off it. I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but Most of them will be killed. The warrior races of the Federation will rise up to battle the Skorr. Last week with you, Captain.

789,TAS,episode 15,TCHAR,"Two centuries past, my people, the Skorr, were great warriors. We had advanced military technology and we could breed vast armies rapidly. But today we are a civilised people because of Alar. Our salvation and our teacher. He brought us peace. He made us great. He died, and we made him immortal. Our Soul, the Soul of the Skorr, was stolen. The known galaxy. My government fears this, so the theft of the Soul of Alar has been kept secret. But we must recover it before my people discover it gone and go mad, launch a jihad, a holy war on the galaxy. I cannot feel the Soul. We are nowhere near it. Are you certain, human? I will scout overhead. I can see something. I can sense it, the Soul of Alar is there. Kirk. There is a ravine sixty metres to your left. If it can be blocked, the lava will flow past those rocks to one side. Hurry. Wait. Yes, yes! EM3GREEN I'll go ahead. I can sense the Soul. I will fly ahead, examine the building, and meet you on the way. Yes. The entrance should be . Can you open it? EM3GREEN The Skorr were a warrior race. Now what are we? Slaves to the illusion of peace. Cowards, soft in our comfort. This sick dream has stolen our souls. I am Tchar, hereditary prince of the Skorr, leader of battles. I will lead my people into glory, to avenge our history. Yes. A noble death to win a great dream. We will live no longer like worms crawling in the dirt. We will conquer. You will die. But you have my respect. You fought well. You die in grace. EM3GREEN Now you can fly and fight as a Skorr. Let me die."
790,TAS,episode 15,SORD,"I like this place, it's got variety. EM3GREEN I heard him. Come on, insect, move it. You two going to argue honours, or are we going to get on with it? Hang on. Not sure. Thought I saw something move in the brush. Guess you're right. This planet just gets on your nerves. Don't know, Vulcan. A shape, couldn't really make it out. Probably seeing things, like Kirk figures. Maybe the Vedala didn't know about it. Think so? I'm not so sure. Keep working. I'll cover you. Hurry, small one. Let's finish it. Or give this deadfall a chance to finish us. Pretty. How do we reach it? I'm not built for that sort of thing. I'll wait for you down here. No offence, little ones, but let me tackle him. Got nowhere to keep a medal, anyway. But there'll be questions."
791,TAS,episode 15,VEDALA,"Welcome, Captain James Kirk and Commander Spock. I will introduce you. First, Tchar. Hereditary prince of the Skorr, master of the eerie. Sord. EM3GREEN As an expert lockpick and thief, you are welcome. Em3green. Lara is a hunter. She has a flawless directional sense, a necessary skill where you are going. Mister Spock was chosen for his analytical mind and scientific expertise. Captain Kirk for his leadership and adaptability. Tchar will explain your mission. Alar's brain patterns were recorded before his death, in a piece of indurite sculpture. The theft triggered a racial fury in the Skorr. They are preparing for war. Unknown. The motive, as Tchar has said, to provoke a holy war. A mad planet, Geologically unstable. Constant earthquakes, gravitic shifts, tidal waves. The temperature varies from twenty Kelvin to two hundred and four above. Somewhere on that planet, the Soul of Alar is hidden. Three expeditions have tried to recover it. Three expeditions have been lost. You are the next, if you agree. My people could not survive on that planet. You have a chance. Then it is done. We give you thanks. The Soul of Alar is returned to his people. He will be healed of his madness. He is proud, brave. That he will remain, but he will also be sane and whole again. We cannot reward you. For the good of the Skorr, this must be forever secret. You have only our thanks. No. You will return and you will see, there will be no questions, no medals, only our thanks. And in time, even the memory will be gone from you."
792,TAS,episode 15,LARA,"Means nothing. I can tell the way. That way. For sure, birdman. I can't get lost. I can't be fooled about directions. That's why I'm here. Vulcans. Never liked them much myself. Cold-blooded critters, all of them. But not human like you and me. Maybe you got different customs. My world there's a lot of females, not so many men. Come we find a man attractive, we say so. I'm saying so. How do you find me? All the more reason to take what pleasure there might be in it. Real weather. You ever quote anything besides statistics, Vulcan? Something's coming. Never mind that. You got to get us out of here. Twenty one degrees east. Fifty metres to get out of the flow path. Close. Oh! And I was just going to ask, what next? Come on, Em, a bit more. EM3GREEN I'll go with you. Remember, scouting's my job. By rights, I should be doing it alone. We still have to go back, James. I tell you true, I find you an attractive man. If we were together, the trip would be easier. And if anything happened, why, we'd have some green memories. Oh. Wonderful. EM3GREEN What happened to Tchar? No. We've come this far. You're not exactly surprised. Maybe I can get a line on it. Tchar. In the name of the Seven Gods, why? Goodbye, James Kirk. Too bad."
793,TAS,episode 16,MCCOY,"Jim, choriocytosis is a strange disease. In races with iron-based blood, it's practically nothing, but in others Spock has contracted the disease. It's fatal to Vulcans. I've triple-checked, Jim. I wish to God I was wrong. Spock's blood is copper-based. The infection enters the blood stream, and encases the cells so they can't carry oxygen. Yes, Jim. One. A naturally occurring drug called strobolin. But it's only found on a few planets in the galaxy. I can give him injections of a synthesised drug that would slow the disease. But after two days the body builds up an immunity. It loses its effectiveness. By the end of the third day, the disease will be irreversible. What about a rendezvous? Increasing tiredness, steadily decreasing efficiency, all the symptoms of working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Kind of like the test you had to pass back at the Academy. No arguments, Spock. Doctor's orders. I know. As much as it might seem at times that I can't stand that pointy-eared encyclopaedia, I don't want to see that happen to him. McCoy to Bridge. Tell Spock it's time for another shot. This won't hurt a bit, Spock. That's the last time I waste my bedside manner on a Vulcan. Not so fast, Spock. Lie there quietly. Well, that's not too bad. Back to work, Mister Spock. I know, Christine. I know. Don't worry, we'll have the strobolin soon. We've got to have that drug, Jim. The synthetic is useless now. Blasted Vulcan. Why couldn't you have red blood like any normal human? He'll pull through. Jim, what about Spock? If we don't have that drug in twenty hours, he'll die. Captain's log, stardate 6335.6. The Huron has been left as space junk, its engines sabotaged. Captain O'Shea has no idea who attacked his ship, but the intruder must be found and the precious cargo retrieved. Not good, Jim. I'll have to put a respirator on him to help him breathe soon. We don't even know it it's the right one. What's the use of being a doctor, anyway? We're only as good as our drugs and technology make us. Underneath all the tricks, I might as well be practising in the Middle Ages. McCoy here. Less than an hour, Jim. His body functions are slipping fast now. It's got to be a trap, Jim. You've already made up your mind, haven't you, Jim. If this doesn't work, we could lose you and Spock. Jim, we don't have a lot of time. Spock Spock, there's no way you can deny it. I've waited a long time for this, and you're not going to cheat me. Spock, that green blood of yours may have saved you before, but this time it almost did you in. You can't deny it. He's as stubborn as ever. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

And a long range sensor can show that the radioactive residue stops in the middle of the belt. Standard phasers, sir. Weak, though. A diffused, low quality beam. Our deflectors can stop them.

The hold is completely empty. Captain, if the power of those rocks could be harnessed, they'd make a fantastic source of energy. Deflectors holding, sir. No doubt of it, sir. What is it? The dilithium. Transporter room, pinpoint those crystals down there and beam them up! Beam them up now, lad. Captain, it was close."
799,TAS,episode 16,KIRK,"Status, Mister Spock? It'll be nice to play diplomat for a change, eh, Spock? Get to the point, Bones. Are you sure? The result is suffocation. Is there any cure? Library computer. What is the nearest strobolin supply planet to our present position? How long can Spock last without the drug? It'll take four days to get the drug, but Spock will die in three. There's got to be a way. Of course. If we cant go out of our way to get the drug in time, there must be another ship closer to Beta Canopus. Kirk to Bridge. Get me Starfleet, Lieutenant. Captain's log, supplemental. We've arranged to get the strobolin needed to save Mister Spock's life. The starship Potemkin has already picked up the drug and will transfer it to a freighter, the SS Huron, for delivery to the Enterprise. What will the symptoms be, Bones? Come. Yes, Spock. Sit down. We've arranged a rendezvous to pick up the drug you need. No, it won't. One other thing. I've cut your duty time in half. That's all, Spock. Dismissed. It'll hurt seeing him like that. Time to rendezvous, Mister Arex? I hate to ask, but What is it, Bones? Mister Spock. Spock. McCoy wants you in Sickbay. Try ship to ship. Sensor report, Mister Spock. Are they at the rendezvous point? Compute new course, Mister Arex. Let's see what's going on. Was the Huron attacked? Spock, are you all right? Do what you can, Bones. Status? Is anyone on that ship alive? Mister Scott, Lieutenant Uhura, come with me. Mister Sulu, you have the conn. We're beaming over. Scotty, check the cargo hold. See if the drug is there. Uhura, see if you can get a playback of the log. I want to know what happened here. Nurse, attend to the wounded. Kirk here. Report, Mister Scott. No drug? All right. Report back up here. Good. Nurse, how is he? Kirk to Enterprise. Ready to beam over. Have the medical team standing by. How's O'Shea, Bones? Can we track it? Lay in that course, Sulu. Ahead warp factor seven. How is he, Bones? We're following the intruder ship's trail. It's got to be. If you really believed that, Bones, you wouldn't still be a doctor after twenty five years. Report. Increase speed to warp eight. A good place for an intruder to hide, wouldn't you say, Mister Sulu? Deflectors up. Yellow Alert. Cut speed to warp one. What was that? Or anything else. Keep those deflectors up, Mister Scott. Also make quite a weapon. Steady as she goes, Sulu. Hard to port, Sulu. Let's face them head on. Hold position. Analysis, Mister Sulu? Orion. Put it on visual, Lieutenant. This is Captain Kirk. For a neutral, you were pretty quick to fire your phasers. Orion's neutrality has been in dispute ever since the affair regarding the Coridan planets and the Babel Conference of stardate 3850.3. Yesterday, a Federation freighter was attacked in this quadrant, its cargo hijacked. As the first alien ship encountered, we require you to submit to search, as per Babel Resolution A12. Reply. Hold on that, Uhura. Tell them to stand by. What about the drug? Uhura, open the channel. Enterprise to Orion vessel. I have a proposal to make. If you do have the Huron's cargo, there were some perishable drugs in it that we desperately need. You keep the dilithium shipment, no mention of the whole incident to Starfleet or in my log, plus and additional galactic standard weight container of dilithium as payment for the drug. Very well. Kirk out. Kirk to Sickbay. Bones, how much time? Just hold out a little longer. Put it on the screen, Lieutenant. Do you have a counterproposal? Face to face? Where? It could be a trap, but it's the only way to get the drug. And Spock will die if we don't. Yes, but not without precautions. I'll keep my communicator channel open so you can hear what goes on. Keep the transporter locked on me, and if anything goes wrong, Scotty, I'm trusting you. If we don't try, Spock doesn't have a chance. Enterprise to Orion vessel. I accept your terms. All right. Kirk out. Pure strobolin. I'll take that now and we can both beam up. You can't escape the Enterprise. But so will yours. Scotty, energise. Let's get up to the Bridge. Open hailing frequencies, Uhura. Grab him! Poison. I'm sure your ship is ready to self-destruct, Captain, but if it does, your crew will die for nothing. We're not going to let you commit suicide. Whether they die or not, you'll still stand trial, and Orion's little game of neutrality and piracy is over. This is Captain Kirk. We have your captain as prisoner. Your choice, sir. Am I interrupting something? Yes, gentlemen, things are back to normal."
800,TAS,episode 16,SPOCK,"All systems affirmative, Captain. The Enterprise is on course and on schedule. You wished to see me, sir? I trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at Deneb Five. Will that be all, Captain? Captain, that won't be necessary. I'm quite able Anything else, sir? I was conserving energy, Captain. An unnecessary assurance, Doctor, in addition to being untrue. Such restraint would be welcome. Thank you, Doctor. No, sir. They hadn't reached it. The Huron's power levels are at bare minimum for life support, Captain. I'm picking up metallic debris. Based on present data, I would say yes. Captain, I Doctor McCoy, I Nothing but Doctor McCoy's gloating. I still prefer my physiological structure to yours."
801,TAS,episode 16,UHURA,"Captain, I'm getting a signal from the Huron. It's an emergency beacon, automated. I did, sir. No response. Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency. Still unable to make contact, sir. This screen is out, sir. But we can take the tapes and play them back on the Enterprise. They're hailing us, Captain. Channel open, sir. The Orions are hailing us, sir. I have the Orion vessel, sir."

We couldn't be sure you were non-hostile. We have no Federation cargo aboard. Orions are not thieves. If you don't cease this harassment, we will lodge a formal protest with your government. What would these drugs be worth to you if we had them? We get what we want, plus our neutrality remains intact? We will consider your offer. Your proposal requires us to trust you. It's obvious we can't. Yes. A face to face exchange between you and me. On the large asteroid near our ships. We could beam down simultaneously, and I would hand you the drug myself. You wouldn't even have to give us the extra dilithium crystals. Now it's your turn to consider. Status, Lieutenant? You're saying we can't escape? Orion's official neutrality comes before this ship or its crew. We can't take Kirk's word that he won't report this incident to Starfleet. Do you have a plan, Lieutenant? Can we convert the asteroid we're orbiting into a doomsday bomb that will destroy both ships? But what? What will it take? No. I'll take it with me when I beam down to meet Captain Kirk. I want the satisfaction of seeing his face when I tell him he and his crew are going to die with us. And I'm sure they don't trust us. If Kirk and I are on the asteroid, the Enterprise will stay close by. What is your answer, Captain? Very well. We will synchronise co-ordinates and beam down in fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes or not at all, Captain. The drug, as promised, Captain. Scan it if you wish. No, Captain. I can't trust that you won't report this incident to Starfleet. If you do, my planet will lose its neutrality and be subject to Federation retaliation. But we can destroy it. I have an explosive device in my backpack that will start a molecular chain reaction and detonate this asteroid. Your ship will be destroyed. All unsuccessful Orion missions end in suicide. Disarm the self-destruct system. Prepare to surrender to the Enterprise. Captain's log, stardate 6336.2. The Orion crew is in our brig, their ship in tow, and the Enterprise is back on course for Deneb Five."

Yes, sir, but Analysis of the asteroid shows that it can't be detonated by our phasers. A powerful explosive right on the asteroid's surface. I could rig a remote control device. Very well, sir. I'll get to work. Gone? He's been captured, no doubt. Arm our self-destruct system, Ensign."

Lieutenant Uhura, we could track the Captain down. We're talking about the Captain. Standing by. Lieutenant Arex, have you found them yet? What's that? Aye, that tears it. The Loch Ness monster couldn't get through that. {Kirk, Spock and Bem are hiding behind a hut) Have you found the Captain yet? I think he said 'maybe'. Well, that convinces me. Ready a security squad. We're going down there. Issue phaser rifles. Captain, are you all right? Beg pardon, sir?"
891,TAS,episode 17,KIRK,"Sensors report several groupings of aborigines. They may be dangerous. So I want all of us to avoid any unnecessary risks. But these monitoring devices have to be planted. Lieutenant Uhura will be tracking us throughout. Now, if there's any trouble of any kind, beam up immediately. Don't try to be a hero. Commander Bem, what are you doing here? Commander Bem, you were assigned to this ship as an independent observer, yet you have spent the past six missions in your quarters. You haven't done any observing at all until now, when we're dealing with possibly a very dangerous planet. This mission is not for casual observers. It could be hazardous. Commander Bem, this is not a joyride, a pleasure excursion. I cannot let you beam down to the planet without adequate protection. I'm sure you understand the diplomatic consequences if anything were to happen to you while you are under my protection. This is an odd time to remain adamant. All right, let's go. There's a planet waiting for us. Energise. We're all right. In the future, Commander Bem, you will leave the operation of the transporter to Mister Scott, or one of the regular transporter crew. What is it, Lieutenant? Say again. Is it moving? It might be just an atmospheric effect. Some kind of electrical storm. We've seen unidentified planetary phenomena before that have resembled intelligent activity. Keep watching it, Lieutenant Uhura, and put the ship on Yellow Alert. We'll continue the contact mission for now, but notify us immediately if there's any change in the situation. Kirk out. All right. We must take care not to be seen. Hey, Bem. Bem, come back! Scotty, Sulu, stay here with the monitoring devices. Come on, Spock. Let's go. He's gone. There he is. I don't know how he did it, but he got through. Come on, we'll have to go around. That Pandronian's actions just don't make sense. I think we've lost him. That way. Yes, and the food they have gathered is Bem. Maybe we can beam him out of there. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. This isn't my communicator. This communicator's been on my belt since we beamed down. Our phasers and communicators have been switched for phonies and Commander Bem has run off. We've been separated from the rest of the landing party. Mister Spock, something funny is going on. But Commander Bem's difficulty appears to be genuine. Phasers or not, we have to rescue him. We're going to have to follow them. We can't risk it, not while they're moving. We may never be able to find them again. Commander Bem seems to be a model prisoner. We'll have to wait until nightfall. Shut up. We're rescuing you. I don't think Starfleet would approve. Come on. Uh oh. How come we always end up like this? I was just expressing my curiosity at our ability to get into these kind of situations. Fate, Spock? Why don't you try your Vulcan nerve pinch. Commander Bem, I'm afraid that we're not going to be able to rescue you. Commander Bem, you are responsible for the situation we are in. You disobeyed orders by running off. Your attitude has been extremely abrasive and, I don't know how you did it. You replaced our phasers and communicators with phonies. Either one could solve our problems right now. Commander Bem, if you had those two phasers and those communicators all this time, why didn't you use them to escape? I want those phasers and communicators now. Commander Bem, if you could split yourself into separate parts, why didn't you escape on your own earlier? This is not a laboratory, Commander Bem. This is a hostile planet, and representatives of Starfleet are not experimental animals for you to test! Consider yourself under arrest. Protective custody, to keep you from any more escapades. Mister Spock, keep watch. There's some kind of interference on all channels. We're going to have to get out of this village on our own. I concur, Mister Spock. Set phasers to stun, just in case. Fire. I'm paralysed. Who are you? I am Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock and honorary Commander Ari bn Bem of the planet Pandro. It is our mission. We must classify this planet. We have to test it. There are times, Mister Spock, when I think I should have been a librarian. Commander Bem, Mister Spock and I are here because we thought that you were worth rescuing. It was more to preserve the diplomatic relations between the Federation and planet Pandro than from any great affection for yourself. Wait! Unlock us. Set us free! It's worth a try. Kirk to alien intelligence. This is Captain James Tiberius Kirk calling the ruling intelligence of this planet. Answer me, please. Mister Spock, whatever we're dealing with, I don't think we can bribe it. We must be honest. Kirk to alien intelligence. I don't think it's strong enough to be noticeable. Do it. This is Captain James Tiberius Kirk calling the ruling intelligence of this planet. Do you hear me? Kirk to entity. Kirk to entity. We apologise for intruding. We did not realise the situation. We will leave. We will tell others of our kind not to bother you here. Just one thing. There is a third member of our group. He has fled. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Stand by. We're not leaving without Bem. He is our responsibility. We can't leave him here. Beam down a security squad with heavy duty tricorders set for Pandronian scanning. Thanks, Scotty. Spread out. Find Commander Bem. He's split into three individual parts. He's some kind of colony creature. And take care not to injure any of the natives here. Phasers on lightest possible stun setting. And don't fire unless absolutely necessary. Let's get out of here before we make any more trouble. You have endangered all of us by your actions, and you have forced us to interfere with the natives of a planet that deserves prime directive protection. Not on my ship you don't. We could not leave one of our own behind. It is our responsibility to take care of our own, just as it is your responsibility to take care of yours. We could not leave him here where he might further interfere with your, your children. He is found, and we will leave. Disassemble? We will go now. Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up. Stand by to break orbit. Mister Spock, classify this planet as being strictly quarantined. Under no circumstances may any Federation vessel approach. It is necessary. Not only for them, but for us as well. Mister Spock, the difference is meaningless. In comparison, we're all still children. Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Let's go home. Put it on audio, Lieutenant Uhura."
892,TAS,episode 17,SPOCK,"The implication is that there is something else on this planet. Perhaps something intelligent. The rain forest is especially thick in his district. Life on this planet appears to be geologically younger than one would expect, given the age of this star. He won't get far in there. He would have had to go through here to escape. They might to another Pandronian, Captain. I believe he went that way, Captain. On the other hand It appears to be a native food-gathering party. These are not Enterprise communicators, Captain. They are fakes. Excellent, but non-working forgeries. Our phasers don't work either. An alternate course of action would appear to be advisable. One of us could go back to contact Mister Scott. These aborigines appear to be in a late primitive state. Obviously intelligent, they seem to have a basic language and social structure. I would assume fairly well developed mores and traditions as well. This is how you observe, by being captured? I assume that's a rhetorical question, Captain, not requiring an answer. Fate, Captain. Fate. I believe that is the correct Earth term. Captain, I am only a Vulcan. There are limits. Fascinating. Remarkable. Commander Bem is a colony creature. I doubt we'll be able to do so without being seen, Captain. We're held in stasis, Captain. The job of librarian would be no less challenging, Captain, but it would undoubtedly be a lot less dangerous. Captain, perhaps we can attract the attention of the alien intelligence and reason with it. Perhaps an offering of some sort, Captain. Hmm. If we connect our two communicators in series, we can give off a high energy burst which might work, but it will also render the communicators powerless in a very short time. Captain, I compliment you on a wise decision. Fascinating, Captain. A highly advanced alien entity using this particular system as a laboratory for guiding another race to intelligence. Almost a god, you might say."
893,TAS,episode 17,UHURA,"Lieutenant Arex has been tracking a non-network sensory stasis. It's hardly more than a flicker, and it's several thousand kilometres west of your position. An anomaly, sir. It resembles a sensor field, but without a scanning grid or other point of reference. Contact the landing party. Mister Scott, where's the Captain? The Captain is not answering his communicator and it does not show up on the scanning grid. It's as if its responder has been disconnected. We're picking up increased activity from that anomaly. Is Mister Spock with the Captain? Lieutenant Arex, start a sensor scan for Captain Kirk and Mister Spock. Landing party, prepare to beam up. I'm sorry, Mister Scott, that's not procedure. We can't take chances. I know it, but we have to follow his orders. Stand by to beam up. Mister Scott, that sensory anomaly, it's expanded to cover the whole northern continent. We can't get any readings at all now. Which means? Enterprise. Uhura here. Captain, are you all right? Aye, aye, Captain. Captain, I'm picking up a message."

This one has decided that the nexus is now. Must observe workings of starship and crew. Am prepared. Understanding it is, Captain, but this one remains adamant. Am prepared to accompany. This one has already set controls, Mister Scotty. Assistance is offered. This one is picking up readings of a large group of life forms directly ahead. Kirk Captain? You are interfering with observations. As logical a way as any, Spock Commander. Good intentions, Kirk Captain, are not enough. Planet Pandro will be much displeased. Starfleet told us you are best captain in fleet. Actions to date belie this. You place too much dependence, Kirk Captain, on phasers and communicators. If that is all. Sir, this one does not demean oneself by the use of casual violence to accomplish goals. But you may demean yourself if you wish. Compliance with orders is. This one must disassemble. And deny you the opportunity to prove your value to planet Pandro by rescuing this one from possibly dangerous situation? You have mishandled situation again, Kirk Captain. This one judges you not an intelligent commander. Planet Pandro is unconcerned as to fate of this one. Pandro will not have dealings with inefficient and inferior species. You have failed everything you have attempted. You have not rescued this one and you have not been able to handle local aborigines. This one wishes you, what is the Earth word? Luck. You will require it. Embarrassment results. This one is shamed. This one has failed in its judgement. This one exists by its own standards. This one has greatly erred. The mission was to judge, and right of judgement was not conferred. This one must disassemble unity. Never to exist again as a co-operation. This unity is defective. This unity must cease to exist.

979,TAS,episode 18,MCCOY,"Nevertheless, we're still in business and I propose a toast to a narrow escape. What coincidence? We used to pull stunts like this in medical school with trick glasses. Don't look now, but we've got a practical joker in our midst. Another coincidence, Jim? Just what the doctor ordered. It is lovely, but I'm more in the mood for a nice quiet walk in the woods. And best of all, no practical jokes. It was probably just one of the audio tapes rewinding. Come on, there's lots more to see. Lieutenant Uhura, I have to hand it to you. This is just what the doctor would have ordered. I'm going to get to the bottom of this right now. Okay, whoever you are, so we fell for your juvenile joke. Now get us out. When I get my hands on the clown who's behind all this, I'll put him in Sickbay for a week. Then let's move before we all turn into icicles. You two better go on without me. My old legs have given out. I hate to be a pessimist, but that may not be as easy as you think. Then again We're as happy about it as you are, Jim. I'd just like to make one request. Could you turn up the heat? Jim, what in heaven's name is going on? Okay, I admit it's an effective bluff, but so what? As soon as they figure it out, they'll destroy the balloon and us. They must be furious to follow us this deep into Federation territory. What the devil is going on? Well done, Jim. Shall we tell them how they can reverse the effects of the field, Jim?"
980,TAS,episode 18,GREEN,
981,TAS,episode 18,SULU,"Aye, aye, sir. Mister Spock, who the devil's attacking us? Captain Kirk! An unidentified energy field is drifting into our path. It worked. The Romulans turned back rather than risk the energy field. He, this glass just leaked all over me. Well, what'll it be, a swim at the beach? Then woods it is. It's so peaceful. So relaxing. I'm not sure. It almost sounded like someone chuckling. There it is again. Someone is definitely laughing at us. We've got a whiteout condition here. How will we ever find the exit? The temperature must be twenty below and its still dropping. I know. If we don't, if we don't keep moving we're going to freeze. Captain's log, supplemental. Somehow Spock managed to switch on our emergency air before collapsing from the effects of the gas. The fresh air quickly revived us, although it'll be exhausted in another six hours. Well, what do you know? Come on, Doctor, we're finally getting out of here. Captain, the helm no longer responds. We're coming about to a new heading. Course stabilizing at one one four mark twelve. We're decelerating, sir. Yes, Captain. Our course will take us nowhere near it. We're changing course, to a direct bearing on the energy field. The controls are responding now."

We should be in tip-top shape in another twenty four hours, no thanks to those Romulan vultures. And mine. Twas probably a minor slip-up of the food synthesisers. I'll check it out after lunch. No thanks, Arex. I'm just going to grab a sandwich and get me back to work. One grilled cheese on rye. What the blazes? Hold it just a doggone minute! I said one sandwich, that's all. Someone turn off this infernal food factory. Go ahead and laugh. Big joke. I'll bet you two are responsible for this, ay? Tell that to the Captain. I'm reporting both of you just as soon as I The situation has reached the point where friends are accusing friends. The entire crew is on edge, myself included. Aye, Captain. Kidnapped? Blue blazes. Aye, aye, sir. Time for a nap, old girl. Captain's orders. Engineering to Bridge. Emergency. Beats me, sir. Our gravity just reversed polarity all by itself. Vacate sir? But Aye sir. You bloody big scatterbrain. Make up your monumental mind. Engineering. Captain, what is it? Are you all Are you Captain, none of our power tools work. Some kind of energy drain set up by the ship. We're giving it a mighty go with the crowbars, though."
985,TAS,episode 18,KIRK,"Scotty, give us maximum shielding. Mister Sulu, bring us about to a new heading of nine oh two mark six. Negative. We've suffered damage and we're outnumbered three to one. I think this is an instance where discretion is the better part of valour. I demand an explanation for this unprovoked attack. We came nowhere near Romulan territory. I deny all charges and plan to file a detailed complaint with the Federation. But it may be just what we need to shake the Romulans. Batten down, we're going through. Mister Spock, what are our chances? Reduce speed to sub warp cruise. We'll lay by here for repairs. How are the repairs progressing, Scotty? Salud! Now let's not jump to conclusions, Bones. Yes, we all got wet, so what's the joke? Fine. Right now why don't we all eat up before our food gets cold. I'm beginning to wonder, Bones, I am beginning to wonder. Captain's log, supplemental. Unusual incidents have continued to plague our crew. Even the perceptive Mister Spock has fallen victim to these simple-minded pranks. What have you got there, Spock? I'm sorry, Spock, it's your As these little surprises have grown more and more frequent, our crew members have found them less and less amusing. Okay, this whole thing has gone far enough! I've just picked up my clean uniforms from the service chute and when I put this one on, I discovered this. When you all finish laughing, I'd appreciate an explanation. Well somebody certainly did. Really, M'Ress, you're going to have to be a little more clever than that. Now what? Here, Spock. Whoops! And it was almost covered with us. I don't know what's going on here, but it's going to stop before someone's hurt. There's that laugh again. Something awfully familiar about it. What do you make of all this, Spock? You mean you know who's behind these stunts? Of course. That laugh, it's the voice of our main computer. Spock, I want all hands at their stations. We're going to run a complete systems check from bow to stern and get to the bottom of this. That's strange. Repeat the call. Spock, quiz the central computer about McCoy and the others. Did I hear that right? Let me try. This is Captain James T Kirk speaking. You are programmed to obey any direct order I may give, correct? Very well. I order you to release crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and Uhura immediately. Well, I'll be Pu-leese. Scotty. We've got serious trouble with the main computer. We have reason to believe it's kidnapped three of our crew. To prevent any further trouble, I want you to shut down all logic functions until we can get a handle on the problem. Scotty, what the devil's going on? This is crazy. Our own computer's declared war on us and I haven't the slightest idea why. Scotty, vacate the computer room. On the double, Officer Scott. Congratulations, Spock. Your strategy worked. Now would you tell me what's happening to my ship? Certainly. What can we do to stop it? Bridge here. Report. Okay, stand by. Scotty, we need a work crew with power tools to open a frozen door. Have them report to, report to Come on, Spock. Where's that Vulcan sense of humour? We must cure the computer by then or there's no telling what we'll be forced to breathe next. Scotty, how's the door coming? Keep at it. We've got three people in there whose lives may depend on it. You don't know how good it is to have you back on the Bridge, alive and well. Sure, Bones, what? I'll see what I can As soon as our course stabilizes, give me a reading. And you can bet those Romulan ships will be gunning for us. You know as much as I do, Bones. Wait a minute. There is a method to this madness. The Enterprise is pulling her biggest practical joke of all, and this time the joke's on the Romulans, the same Romulan ships that damaged the Enterprise. What else? She's going to make fools of the Romulans by having them attack a balloon, and Romulans fear disgrace more than death. I don't care about the Romulans, I just want to avoid that energy field we passed through before. Helmsman, do you have a fix on it? Good! I couldn't face going through there again. It petrifies me. No! We can't! Bones, the worst thing you can do to a practical joker is to play a practical joke on them. Yes, but later. Let's not spoil their fun just yet. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

986,TAS,episode 18,SPOCK,"Romulans, Captain. They were apparently lying in wait on the far side of that asteroid. Captain, the Romulan ships are overtaking us. At close range our deflectors will be unable to repel their attack. Strange. It's not on the charts. The field is composed of highly charged subatomic particles. If the density grows no worse we should be able to ride it out. It appears we're all victims of a rather bizarre coincidence. The odds against something like this happening are astronomical. Curious, very curious. Captain, I found this device on my console. It seems to serve no useful function, and Captain? Captain, I never laugh. It appears to be a legitimate fog. Perhaps the humidification system is Amazing. This deck is covered with ice. The evidence all points to one guilty party, Captain. Not who, what. I believe our practical joker is the Enterprise itself. Precisely. All hands to your stations. This is a general alert. Repeat, all hands to your Yes, Captain. Question. Why are we unable to communicate with crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and Uhura? Affirmative. The dysfunction is more severe than I thought. Question. Are you deliberately holding our missing crewmembers prisoner? I suggest compliance, Captain. An obvious defensive manoeuvre by the computer. I have a theory, Captain, but first I suggest that if Officer Scott moves away from the computer, it might feel less threatened. You recall that energy field we passed through? Apparently, subatomic particles from that field have invaded our computer's circuits, much like bacteria infect living matter. As a result, the Enterprise is suffering the electronic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. I'm afraid I don't know, Captain. Its illogical behaviour precludes a logical solution. Hmm. Just as I thought. Our air is being pumped full of nitrous oxide. Better known as laughing gas. But it's no laughing matter, especially for Vulcans. Captain, we're underway. We're heading back to the Neutral Zone. Sensors are picking up three ships, Captain. Magnification shows them to be Romulan warships. The Romulan ships have halted their attack. Apparently the sight of a spacecraft twenty times their size has given them second thoughts. Please elaborate, Captain. Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is seeking revenge? The Romulans are giving chase. And I'm getting normal function in all computer modes. That last pass through the energy field apparently reversed all effects."
987,TAS,episode 18,UHURA,"Captain, I've established contact with the Romulan commander. After that ride, I could use some repairs. Cheers! To us. How do you like that? So did mine. Good, the Rec Room is unoccupied. At least we can enjoy our off-hour without worrying about practical jokes. Doctor, that sounds perfect. What was that? There. Look, this is still a room, no matter how it appears. If we can travel long enough in one direction, we're bound to reach a wall. Then we can feel our way to an exit. This blizzard keeps getting worse. But Doctor, we can't. Engine room reports all engines shut down, yet they're firing. Main cargo hatches are opening. I'll put them on the viewing screen. Captain, I'm picking up strange transmissions from the Romulan warships. Listen."

Trial? You mean kangaroo court. I've heard about Dramian justice. Of course I am. Bones harming other beings. You know better, Spock. I know better. Not Bones. Nonsense. I don't buy that, Bones.

Ah, yes. Take care of that oversight, will you, Mister Sulu? Now, now, Demos. You're hardly in a position to take on an entire crew. You will remind me to report my conduct to the Federation, won't you Mister Spock? I would, but unfortunately we're out of communications range. Sorry, Commander. Your ship is, er, impounded. Radiation level, Mister Sulu? Good. Then it's safe for us to beam down to Dramia Two. Shall we, gentlemen? Absolutely. Now, now, Mister Spock, you're not trying to scare our Dramian friend, are you? Of course, you can back out if you'd like, Commander. You heard the man, Mister Scott. Not the most enchanting place I've ever been to. Trouble? Inhospitable or not, he mustn't get away. Wait! He's disappeared. It's almost as if he dematerialised. I'm sure you won't mind if I ignore your advice. Bones' life is on the line, Mister Spock. Cave dwellers? In the midst of your civilisation? You say it, Demos, but that doesn't But how did he survive the plague? Then you can tell us. Do you remember? Kol-Tai. Doctor McCoy, do you remember him? Beam us aboard, Mister Scott. Quickly. Let's get underway for Dramia. Meet Kol-Tai, Mister Scott. A friend of Doctor McCoy's. Warp six, Scotty. Mister Spock? How's our number one passenger doing? Good. We want him to be a sterling witness. Let's hope the trial hasn't started. Yes, Mister Spock. What is it? Academic. The plague! Set up an immediate quarantine, Lieutenant. We've got to save him. Yes, for McCoy's sake. And for Kol-Tai's sake too. You see, Commander, we do place a value on life. All life. Does that shock you, Commander? Mister Spock, take command. Mister Spock. We have to get McCoy. Must find an antidote. Got to get McCoy. Spock, you're sure? Bones, that's it. Aurora, changing colour. Bones, you did it! And we'll forget about a certain stowaway. Beam us aboard, Mister Scott. Gentlemen, I don't know about you, but I'm ready to get back to Starbase."
1083,TAS,episode 19,SPOCK,"According to this, Doctor McCoy was responsible for a plague which ravaged the planet Dramia Two some nineteen years ago, Captain. Captain, you're becoming emotional. The termination of your inoculation programme and the subsequent outbreak of plague could have been coincidence, Doctor. What now, Captain? No, Captain. The historical records of this solar system are spotty, at best, going back nineteen years. Mostly they're technical data, meteor showers, auroras, radiation reports. Plague, Dramia Two. Of unknown origin, characterised by pigmentation changes in skin of victim, debilitation, death. Certain species known to have natural immunity, notably Vulcan. Hmm. Interesting. You're planning something, Captain? Of course, Captain. You are a stowaway, Commander. Decidedly non-lethal, however. Decidedly. There's a difference, Captain. Surely you're not an outsider, Commander. You're Dramian. Not likely, Captain. Caution would seem to be advisable, Captain. The pigmentation changes associated with the disease in our computer records, Captain. Yes, Captain? Clean, fed, in good health, and resting. Captain. The trial may be academic. Yes, Captain. Kol-Tai is turning blue. He's hardly fit to testify at the trial, Captain. Captain, you're blue. Captain's log, stardate 5276.4. We are in orbit around the planet Dramia, under the conditions of general quarantine. As Commanding Office, I have ordered the activation of General Order Six. General Order Six has been activated? Good. Report to Sickbay, Mister Sulu. I assure you I am capable, Mister Sulu. Captain, your condition. This is the Enterprise. I must speak with the Supreme Prefect. The Captain and all of the crew members are incapacitated. The plague is aboard the Enterprise. The same. You must release Doctor McCoy temporarily. He is needed to find an antidote. We have a witness in McCoy's behalf. You must trust me. Impossible. He too is stricken. If you'll permit me, Captain, I might be able to get McCoy. I can't infect the planet, Captain. And I can get McCoy. Later, Doctor. Doctor, just come with me, please. Doctor, you will stand trial, you will find out, after you've found and antidote for the plague which is about to kill everyone aboard the Enterprise. You wouldn't give me a chance. You realise, Doctor, if you go, and fail to find an antidote, you too will die. Beam us aboard, Captain. Negative, Doctor. The file on all known diseases doesn't recognise these symptoms of pigmentation changes. That's it, Doctor. The colour change symptoms were misleading the computer. Which brought on the particular plague just as this aurora has brought it on. That's the problem, Doctor. There is no known antidote. However, Doctor, do you remember a certain Kol-Tai? A man you treated for Saurian virus? Possibly nothing. However, Kol-Tai did survive the first plague. I presume, Doctor, that you have a supply of live Saurian virus antibodies in your laboratory? Including, I would hope, some of that monotonous, old dispensing of the regular vitamin rations to the crew. Well, you have been derelict in your duties of late, Doctor. Hippocrates would not have approved of lame excuses, Doctor."

We are beyond subspace communications with Starfleet. Am proceeding under my own authority. And you are not in authority to conduct an investigation in our star system. I demand that you report to the Federation now! Then I will proceed to your starbase and report your act. I have been tricked. Captain's log, stardate 5275.9. We are approaching Dramia Two, where we hope to find the answers concerning the question of Doctor McCoy's guilt or innocence. Situation normal. Aurora reported in the sector, however. I go. Plagues seldom leave behind fields of flowers, Captain. They do not like outsiders. The distinction here is between the world of the living and the world of the walking dead. I would advise against that, Captain. A result of your Doctor McCoy and his inhumane methods. He attacked you because you are an Earthling, Captain, even as was McCoy. He, like the others who remain here, was away at the time. They returned to their planet to find that their families had succumbed to the plague. He and a few others, senseless in their grief, chose to live here in desolation. You see, Captain, there were no actual survivors. For McCoy's sake. It is not that. It is Thank you, Doctor. Captain's log, stardate 5276.8.

You try to put more than one hand on them and they throw off a charge of two thousand volts. How did you ever capture it? Jim, the Enterprise broke free. Most of the animals would just lay there.

Mister Walking Bear, how Mister Walking Bear, how do you know who's aboard that ship? Then we could be dealing with the basis of all those legends. A space traveller who visited Earth in primitive times. But why would Kukulkan want to destroy us? Mister Walking Bear, what do the legends say about Walking Bear. What's he doing to my crew? We must be somewhere inside that other ship. Mister Walking Bear, do the legends say what happened to Kukulkan? Then that space probe that approached Earth must have been his. Listen. Is there any way Spock could get through to us? Let's find out. They look like the obelisks built by the ancient Egyptians. But it's still a clue. This city is one gigantic riddle. Keep alert. Opinion, Mister Walking Bear. Kukulkan must have visited several ancient peoples on Earth. But each one used only parts of his knowledge to build their cultures. If no one on Earth built this city exactly right, then that's why Kukulkan never came back. The entire city is our key. Then there has to be some sort of signalling device here. That pyramid seems to be the centre of everything. I'm going up there. The rest of you spread out and circle it. What's this? The sun. That's it. Scotty, turn the head all the way around and aim it up here. Turn the other heads this way! Bones, the serpent heads! Turn them to face the pyramid! I'm coming down. The whole things is an energy amplification system. This is Kukulkan's signalling device. We have no weapons. And if we did, we would use them only with reason. But we don't hate you. We used them in self-defence. You fired on us. Bones, Scotty, quiet. You say that we forgot you. How can you expect us to regard you as a deity if we don't remember you? Even so, I would hardly call your city our natural environment. But no one being, not even you, has the right to interfere with other cultures. Why, Bones? But if children are made totally dependent on their teachers, they will never be anything but children. Then we've got to distract him and give Spock some time. Bones, what would happen if we pulled the cables on some of these cages. Come on, Bones. Kukulkan, can't you control one of your own creatures? Quick, your hypo. Full tranquilliser setting. I'm fine, Bones. The cat's last power jolt clipped me. Kukulkan, I think we've earned the right to be heard. You think of us as being small creatures like this one. Are we really that inferior to you? Because we have minds, we can't be what you wanted us to be. If we fail or succeed, it has to be our own doing. Intelligent life is too precious a thing to be led by the nose. You did, long ago, when it was needed most. Our people were children then. Kukulkan, we've grown up now. We don't need you anymore. And the Toltec's Quetzalcoatl, the Chinese dragon and all the rest. But not quite a god. Just an old, lonely being who wanted to help others. It's sad. Think what we could have done with his knowledge. But the price was just too high. Yes, Bones, I remember it. How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.

But sensors now indicate it is twice our size. Vessel appears extremely unorthodox in design. And Starfleet lists no other authorised vessels in this quadrant. Approaching ship has an immense energy field surrounding it. Fascinating. Readings indicate the vessel is composed entirely of crystalline ceramic. I would almost say We have been encased in a globular force field, Captain. The source is the approaching vessel. It is a force globe, but one that is flexible enough to absorb any force. I cannot explain it. Clearly we cannot escape by simply fleeing. Sensors indicate we at now being probed. Evasive action will not be effective, Captain. The force globe limits our manoeuvreing. Still approaching, Captain. Going sublight. It continues to probe us. Its surrounding energy pattern is now shifting. Captain, library computer confirms that Ensign Walking Bear is correct. The Mayas had a legend of a winged serpent god who came from the skies, bringing knowledge. Such legends were not uncommon among Earth's peoples, Captain. Entirely possible. Captain. Captain's log, stardate 6063.5. First Officer Spock in temporary command. The Enterprise is the captive of an alien life form calling itself Kukulkan. Captain Kirk and three other officers have vanished. They most likely were transported by Kukulkan to his ship. Lieutenant Uhura, you are supposed to be monitoring the alien vessel. Our first priority is to free the Enterprise and ourselves. Return to your duties. Of course. The elasticity of the force field can respond in only one direction at a time. All hands to battle stations. Full impulse power, helmsman. Tractor beam on, full power. Warp engines on standby. Mister Arex, prepare to compensate for warp catapult effect. When we break free, we will be thrown approximately five point six nine eight light years. The force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of time. We shall both push and pull on it simultaneously. It should become rigid enough for a burst of warp power to shatter it. Full warp power on my order. Now. Reverse engines and come about. Lay in spiral evasive course for Kukulkan's ship. Interesting, Captain. The creature was the Mayan god from the ancient legends. Not legends, Doctor. Fact. Vulcan was visited by alien beings.

We should have been smashed. Captain, there it is. I recognise it. Kukulkan. I am a Comanche, Captain. I've studied the histories of many ancient Earth peoples, especially my own. That ship out there bears a strong resemblance to a god in Mayan and Aztec legends, Kukulkan. No, sir. Only that he left and promised one day to return. With one difference, sir. Look at these carvings. That's not Egyptian. This gateway. I can't pin down what culture it represents. Before he left, Kukulkan gave the Mayas a remarkably accurate calendar. He told them to build a city according to its cycles. On the date the city was finished, Kukulkan was supposed to return. The Mayas built their city and waited. Kukulkan never appeared. Yes, sir. But they all failed. Kukulkan said he would appear only when we learned its purpose. That's odd. I've never seen a combination like this before. Look, sir. Another tower. And there's another tower down there. There must be one at all four corners. This is the last one, sir. Then that city we were in wasn't really there. But we work only to create peace.

Fail me again and all of your kind shall perish. Now I will show you the seeds that I have sown before. Learn from them. Find their purpose if you can. Only then will I appear before you. After scores of centuries, my design has been fulfilled. Behold me as I am. Behold Kukulkan! Where are your weapons of destruction? Use them on me if you dare. Where is your hate? You hate me, do you not? Why do you not speak to me of your hate? You fired your weapons at me. I am your master. I may do with you as I will. It is as I thought. You have forgotten me and strayed from the path I set for you. If you do not know me, then it is my task to teach you. Please feel free to examine any of my specimens. But all of these lead a peaceful life, one that is safe and contented. What you cannot see is that each of them, mentally, is in its own natural environment. They eat, breathe and live in worlds created by my machinery, worlds only they can see. They do not know they are in cages. It was meant to be. That city and all else I taught to you ancestors. But they became evil. I have been alone all my life. Destruction fell on my race before your kind had discovered fire. Creatures like these have been my only companions. I have seen you on many worlds. Savage, war-like, filled with self-hate, destroying yourselves in the end. At last I decided to help. As an experiment, I visited your Earth and tried to teach peaceful ways. I left, intending to return when I was summoned, but you never sent for me. Finally, I sent a probe. And what did I find? Warriors. Nothing you have done so far makes me believe that is true. My creatures here have little intelligence. They alone live peacefully in the worlds I have to give. Even this creature, one of the fiercest and most untamable ever created, lives in peace in the world that I create for him. It was an infant and easily controlled, as you were when I visited Earth. You still are children to me, to be led and shown how to live. Enough! This is useless. Despite what I have shown you, you still cling to your disobedient ways. My dream is ending and all of you are to blame. Something is wrong. Escaped? But how? I will smash it this time. No! Stop! Irrational savages. See what you have done. I cannot. Your ship has disabled my central power source. You continue to take advantage of me, but I agree. Speak. No. But the violence of your kind surpasses even that of the power-cat. But you are my children. I hoped I could teach you, help you. I will let you go your own way. I have already done what I can."

We have no control of the ship as long as that alien lassie has us in tow. This is Scott calling the Captain. Well, we just had to learn to run the ship all over again. Every control is working in reverse. Karla Five has given us coordinates to beam down to her son's laboratory, Captain. Aye, sir."
1285,TAS,episode 21,KIRK,"Yes, Commodore, I know the feeling. Your modesty is unnecessary, Mrs. April. Your achievements as a pioneer doctor in space are well known. It's a native of Capella Four, isn't it? Thank you, Mister Spock. Mrs. April, you're about to see another of the galaxy's most beautiful sights, the Beta Niobe's supernova. Yes, we were, Commodore. Put the ship on Red Alert. How fast is it travelling, Mister Spock? But who would have the technology to build a ship that could travel at such a speed? Hard about, helmsman. Change course for twenty four mark seven. That's a course of self-destruction. Lieutenant Uhura, open hailing frequencies. I want to talk to that ship's captain. All right, if they won't talk, we'll slow them down. Mister Sulu, put a tractor beam on that ship. Put it on the screen, Lieutenant. I've never heard that language before. Run that message through the universal translator, Lieutenant Uhura. Perhaps it can tell us what language she is speaking in. Lieutenant, let's hear that tape backward, which should sound forward to us. Open hailing frequencies again, Lieutenant. Tell her she is endangering her life if she remains on her present course. Yes, Scotty, what is it? Mister Arex, what is our speed? Mister Spock, how long until the alien vessel makes contact with the Beta Niobe nova? Give me three and a half minutes, Scotty. I have no choice. I have to release the tractor beam. I can't destroy this ship and four hundred and thirty people to save one person. Mister Sulu, release our beam. What do you mean, Mister Sulu? Go to manual override. We've got to release that beam, or we're going to follow that ship into the nova! I'm sorry, Commodore, Mrs. April. It looks as though we may not reach Babel. There's still one chance. After that ship enters the nova, it should burn up and break contact with our tractor beam. Mister Spock, how long will we have to apply full braking power and execute course change? You heard that, Mister Sulu. Mister Scott, we're going to apply full braking power in a minute. Get ready to execute course change, Mister Sulu. Now, Mister Sulu! Impossible. It should have been destroyed instantly. That other ship may have been able to survive the heat of a nova, but the Enterprise can't. Mister Scott, how about that full braking power? Keep trying those controls, Mister Sulu. It's got to work. Never mind, Mister Spock, it's no use. We're still here. Lieutenant Uhura, can you get us a visual? Where are we? Captain's log, stardate 6770.6. The Enterprise has passed into the most alien landscape I have ever seen. We are in some reverse universe where black stars shine in a white void. We are still in the tow of the alien ship, both of us having survived the extreme heat of the Beta Niobe nova. Yes, Scotty. How are we doing down there? All right. Lieutenant Uhura, we're going to contact that ship again. We need some answers. How's that possible? Explain, Spock. I can understand her now, without the aid of the universal translator. I'm Captain James T Kirk of the Enterprise. We tried to prevent you from entering the Beta Niobe nova. We assumed your ship would burn up. Who are you? How did you come to be in our universe? Our universe. Then we must return the same way, through the two novas. We have little choice. Captain's log, supplemental. We are proceeding to Karla Five's planet, Arret. Gentlemen, I'm sure none of us mind growing younger instead of older for a change. Nevertheless, we must return home and I am open to suggestions. Tell Karla Five that Mister Spock, Commodore April and myself will be beaming down. Her son? We don't have time for children's games right now, Scotty, but beam us down. Then the young child in the playpen We could remain forever awed with the differences between our universes, Karla Five, but we must discover a way to return to our positive matter universe. We need to coordinate this to our own universe. Can we do that, Spock? Yes, we could act as a midwife giving birth to a star. Then we would have two novas in the same position and theoretically return home. I have a crew of four hundred and thirty, Karla Five. Your ship is suitable for only a few people. It should work, yes. But any miscalculation anywhere along the way and we'll be plunging tail first into a supernova. Captain's log, stardate 6770.1. Time continues to flow backward for us. We have set course for a dead star in this anti-matter universe that corresponds with the nova Minara in ours. We're being pulled by Karla Five's unmanned vessel, which is equipped with enough positive matter armament to ignite the dead star into life. we just might get you to Babel after all, Commodore. Yes, Karla Five. We'll burn to a crisp or escape into our own universe. Either way, you'll never hear from us again. Thank you for the sacrifice of your vessel. How much time before the youngest crew member returns to the time of birth? How is our course, Mister Sulu? Mister Arex, take over for him. Lieutenant Uhura, report to navigation console. Never mind. Spock, can you fill in for Sulu and Uhura? What do you mean? I see what you mean. Tractor beam? How do we do that, Spock? Whatever you say. What shall I do? We've received a message from the Federation that might bring you some cheer. Lieutenant Uhura, would you relay it to Commodore April and his wife? I see your flower has blossomed again."
1286,TAS,episode 21,SPOCK,"Excuse me, Captain. You asked to be notified when we made visual contact with the Beta Niobe nova. We're travelling at a safe distance from the nova, Mrs. April. Captain, sensors are picking up an unidentified object travelling at an incredible speed, presently on collision course with the Enterprise. At a speed that should be impossible to achieve. Something on the order of warp thirty six. I believe it is not a natural object, but a ship. No known race, Captain. Nevertheless, it will contact us in one point four minutes. Correction, Captain. The ship was on a collision course only by coincidence. It is apparently heading for the heart of the Beta Niobe nova. Three minutes forty two point seven seconds. Our speed is now warp twenty, and the other ship will contact the nova in one minute fifty eight point three seconds. We are up to warp twenty two and increasing, Captain. We shall have forty two point eight five seconds to correct our course after the alien ship enters the nova. The alien vessel will contact Beta Niobe in fifty two point three seconds, Captain. Contact in thirty nine seconds. Thirty eight, thirty seven Thirteen, twelve, eleven And we are still increasing speed. Contact with the nova in thirty five point one eight seconds. Contact in twenty seconds. Fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve Captain, the flower is not the only thing on board that is growing younger. Ship's chronometers are also running backward. The flow of time is reversed in this universe. The longer we stay here, the younger we will become. Apparently our brains are also working in reverse, Captain, so we can now understand her language. That is why the ship seems to be operating in the reverse to us. It is logical that we must reproduce the conditions that brought us here. Two novas must occupy the same space in both universes in order to create a gateway for us to travel through. One star dying in our universe, and one being born here would recreate the correct conditions. Most logical. If the flow of time is reversed, then one is born at an old age, and dies in infancy. Your descendants are born before you, and your ancestors are born after you. Yes, Captain. Apparently the two universes occupy the same space, but in different dimensions. Correct, Commodore. Now if you'll watch the star map, you'll see the Milky Way. Here is Beta Niobe, and here is Earth. It corresponds exactly with Arret. By superimposing both star maps, we will see where two stars occupy the same place in both universes. The red spheres indicate where two stars are in the same space. No pair are novas in both universes. That's true, Captain. We can't use her ship to transport us, Captain, but we could use it as an unmanned ship with our tractor beam attached. Eighteen minutes thirty seven seconds in real time. But long before that we shall all be children. And, Captain, that also means we are losing our knowledge at an alarming rate. It is possible we will soon be unable to operate the Enterprise. He's too young, Captain. Yes, Captain, but who will fill in for you? At what age did you become a starship captain? And when did you enter Starfleet Academy? As a Vulcan, I age the slowest. I will be capable of assuming command longer than anyone else. But even I will become too young to know what to do. Captain's log, supplemental. We have eleven minutes of real time left to reach the dead star, but all around my crew are turning into children, unable to operate the ship. Ten minutes fourteen point twenty one seconds, Captain. We shall arrive with only moments to spare. We will need to disconnect the tractor beam at the appropriate time. Captain, I must assume command. You are no longer able to command the Enterprise. You are correct, of course. Commodore April, command is yours. Yes, Captain. The dead star is directly ahead, Captain, twelve degrees south of galactic plane. Vessel armed, Captain. Nine seconds to impact. Eight, seven, Three, two"
1287,TAS,episode 21,UHURA,"Captain, that ship is not responding. Captain, they are making visual contact. Captain, the universal translator has the answer. The woman is speaking the same universal language we speak, but she is speaking in reverse. Yes, sir, on the screen. No use, sir. She's refusing to answer. The alien ship is responding to our call, Captain. Captain, we are approaching Arret. Karla Five is asking if you are prepared to beam down to the planet. Karla Five has given us coordinates to beam down to her son's laboratory, Captain. Message coming in from Arret, Captain. I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand all this equipment. What do I do with these controls? In view of Commodore April's heroic actions aboard the Enterprise this stardate, we are reviewing his mandatory retirement, and will consider his appeal to remain Federation Ambassador at large."

I had to return to my own universe, Captain Kirk. I am an explorer of space. I was caught unaware when Amphion, previously a dead star, went nova and came to life. I was pulled into the star. But instead of burning up, I passed into a universe where everything operates in reverse to my universe. Yes. My theory is that two stars going nova in the same place in both universes created a gateway which I passed through. That would be impossible, Captain. Amphion is no longer nova. It has begun it's life as a star. I suggest you set a course to follow my ship. Perhaps our scientists can help solve your problem. May I introduce my son, Karl Four. My father, Captain. But I had to pass through the novas at my ship's top speed to avoid burning up. Your ship isn't capable of such a speed. You are welcome to use my ship, Captain. I want to wish you luck, Captain. Whether you succeed or fail, the outcome will remain unknown to me. It is a small sacrifice, Captain Kirk. Success."
1382,TAS,episode 21,APRIL,"No matter where I've travelled in the galaxy, Jim, this bridge is more like home than anywhere else. To me she was always like my child. I was there in the San Francisco Navy Yards when her unit components were built. Beta Niobe. You were present when the star first started its explosion, Jim. No natural object has ever been recorded as travelling at that speed. Nor I. As starship personnel, we were always prepared to give our lives, Captain. What? I'm sure Captain Kirk has other problems besides your flower, dear. In her universe, a nova is a dead star which comes to life! And when the explosions of a nova in her universe and one in our universe occur together, it's possible to travel between the two universes. It pleases me, Jim. If we stay here long enough, I'll no longer be at the mandatory retirement age. That would take a remarkable coincidence, Mister Spock. Assuming Beta Niobe and Amphion occupy the same space, we can determine if there are any other novas occupying the same space in both universes. If stars begin as dead stars here then we could bring one of them to life prematurely. It could work. That's how we arrived here in the first place. I'll be glad to get home, but not necessarily to Babel. It only means the end of my career, Jim. Mister Spock, as long as I am aboard, I am senior officer. I hate to pull rank, but you will be capable of command only for a few minutes, not long enough to complete the manoeuvres necessary to take us home. Commodore? I'm Captain April, Mister Spock. Make sure no harm comes to them, Sarah. We have to ignite that dead star if we're going home. Mister Spock, you are still capable of following orders? Very good. Assume your post at the navigation console. Arm Karla Five's vessel, Spock. Hang on, we're going right into the heart of the nova. We did it! We're home again! We're all right. We're home. The reverse aging process has stopped. They can enter the transporter. It retains a memory of their original molecular structure. What a blessing to be able to live one's life over again, if the life you've led has left you unfulfilled. No Sarah, I don't want to live it all over again. I couldn't improve one bit on what we've had together. Well, good. Just because someone is seventy five years old doesn't mean they're ready to stop giving service to the galaxy!"

1384,TAS,episode 21,SARAH,"As the first medical officer aboard a ship equipped with warp drive, I'm afraid I had to come up with new ideas all the time. Oh, Doctor, flattery will get you everywhere. But I'm afraid my flower is dying. Yes, but it has a life span of only a few hours. This morning it was a seedling, within a few hours it will be dead. It is beautiful, but also very deadly. We are still starship personnel, Captain. Captain Kirk. The Capellan flower! You don't understand. Before we entered this universe it was about to die. and now it's in full bloom again. It's as if it were growing younger again. I can almost feel it while I'm holding it. Robert, we're the only adults on the bridge. They're all teenagers and children. But the Enterprise crew, they're all children. But what about us? We don't have to use the transporter. We can remain young, live our lives over again. You could command a starship once more. Oh, Robert. Yes, our trip into the negative universe gave it a second life. It gave all of us a second life. <Back to the episode listingStar Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of Studios Inc.
